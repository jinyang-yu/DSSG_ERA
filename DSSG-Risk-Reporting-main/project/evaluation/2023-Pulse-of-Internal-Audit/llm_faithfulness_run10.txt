- Verdict: Not Faithful
- Justification: The generated summary does not accurately reflect the content of the source report.

Additionally, the summary includes specific statistics and trends that are not present in the source material.
- Important Missing or Hallucinated Details: The summary hallucinates details about cybersecurity risk, IT risk, and other specific risk areas, which are not discussed in the source report. The source report's focus on survey results related to internal audit leadership and benchmarking is not reflected in the summary.
