- Verdict: Not Faithful
- Justification: The generated summary introduces several specific risk categories (e.g., Cybersecurity Risk, IT Risk, Third-Party Relationships Risk) that are not mentioned in the source report. The source report focuses on internal audit benchmarks, such as budget, staff, audit plans, and risk levels, without detailing specific risks like cybersecurity or IT. Additionally, the summary includes statistics and trends that are not present in the source material.
- Important Missing or Hallucinated Details: The summary mentions specific risk areas and statistics (e.g., "78% of respondents indicating cybersecurity is a high or very high risk") that are not found in the source report. The source report does not provide detailed information on specific risks or their perceived levels, focusing instead on general audit-related topics.
