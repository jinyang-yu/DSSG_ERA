- Verdict: Not Faithful
- Justification: The generated summary does not accurately reflect the content of the source report. The source report primarily discusses the 2023 North American Pulse of Internal Audit survey, focusing on budget, staff, audit plans, and risk levels, without specific mention of cybersecurity, IT risk, or other detailed risk areas outlined in the summary. The summary introduces several risk categories and statistics that are not present in the source report.
- Important Missing or Hallucinated Details: The summary includes specific percentages and risk categories (e.g., cybersecurity, IT risk, fraud risk) that are not mentioned in the source report. The source report focuses on survey methodology, respondent demographics, and general topics like budget and staffing trends, rather than detailed risk assessments.
