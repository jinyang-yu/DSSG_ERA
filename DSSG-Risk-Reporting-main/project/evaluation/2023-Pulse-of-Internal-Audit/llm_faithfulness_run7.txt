- Verdict: Not Faithful
- Justification: The generated summary introduces several risk categories and statistics that are not mentioned in the source report. The source report focuses on the structure and content of the 2023 North American Pulse of Internal Audit survey, including budget, staffing, audit plans, and risk levels, but does not provide specific details on cybersecurity, IT, third-party relationships, or other risks mentioned in the summary.
- Important missing or hallucinated details: The summary mentions specific risk areas such as cybersecurity, IT, and compliance/regulatory risks, which are not discussed in the source report. Additionally, the source report does not provide any statistics or comparisons between publicly traded and financial services organizations regarding these risks.
