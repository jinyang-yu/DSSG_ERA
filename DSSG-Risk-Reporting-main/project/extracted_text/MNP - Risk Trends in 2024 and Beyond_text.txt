Methodology
The following risk trends are based on real life risk assessments, monitoring, and 
mitigation strategies that MNP Internal Audit Services has executed for clients 
across Canada. Most of these trends have already emerged and are showing signs of 
significant growth with a range of impacts based on industry, size, location, and risk 
preparedness of the organization. 
Though it’s still necessary to ask questions about organizational resilience, risk 
prevention and preparedness are paramount and typically cost a fraction compared 
to reacting to risk when it occurs. This report identifies related risks, key questions and 
red flags to consider.
The key insight this year is that risks are increasingly interrelated, with concurrent 
natural disasters, increased cybercrime, continuous digital transformation, and 
material global conflict all being predominant themes. Organizations can no longer 
ignore the value of proactive risk management and preparedness. 
Think of these risk trends as a set of dominos; each one can trigger the occurrence of 
any of the other risks. As each domino falls, it magnifies the financial and operational 
risks to the organization, making it more vulnerable to yet further risk. 
As we move into the future, continuous monitoring will be instrumental to 
navigate and optimize for a world of integrated risks.

The dark web advantage: Can you beat the hackers at their own game?

Drew Buhr | Cyber Security Risk 
In keeping with the risk outlook over at least the past 10 years, it’s almost certain that cyberattacks will grow even more 
aggressive and brazen in 2024. The pandemic continues to be one of the driving forces behind this uptick, as more 
organizations than ever before now have remote or hybrid work policies in place and operate on cloud-based technologies.
Cloud service providers are a lucrative target for hackers as the entire business model of these providers is predicated on 
operational servers. Even if they’re not willing to pay a ransom, such a hack could also reveal a back door to thousands of 
other clients who may be more inclined to do so. 
Remote work also provides a unique opportunity for insiders to initiate or collude with hackers to facilitate a cyberattack 
on their employers. These attacks have already become more common since 2020, and organizations should expect 
them to increase in frequency as threat actors innovate new ways to recruit and train insiders via financial or punitive 
(e.g., extortion) incentives. 
Other transformation initiatives also have the potential to increase cyber risk. Many organizations have rapidly adopted 
digital platforms and tools without performing the necessary risk assessments and/or updating policies and procedures 
to reflect these changes. Any new hardware or software implementation could be a source of risk. One area of particular 
concern in the year ahead will be the ungoverned use of ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, which have a high 
potential for misuse and could lead to leaks of sensitive and proprietary data. 
The 2022 invasion of Ukraine has also increased tensions between Russia and many developed nations, and raised 
questions about China’s intentions with Taiwan. At the very least this should lead organizations to be more mindful of 
state-sponsored hacking in the coming years as both Russia and China may seek to improve their posture and establish 
cyber superiority. Organizations that should be especially vigilant include the public sector, major infrastructure (energy 
and utilities, oil and gas, etc.), those that have an outsized impact on national GDP, and those that collect and store large 
volumes of personal and proprietary data. 
Finally, organizations should consider the possibility that they may be the target of an ongoing attack or were the victim 
of a past attack that hasn’t yet been detected. The incident need not have resulted in a disruption to normal operations 
for hackers to steal sensitive data — including login credentials and employees’/customers’ personal information — and 
sell it on the dark web. It is now possible to beat the hackers at their own game by utilizing a service that can scan the 
dark web and determine what might be the hacker's next move.
5
Key questions to ask 
•	 What actions have you taken to verify that cloud service providers have the appropriate practices and controls in 
place to anticipate, respond to, and mitigate cyber risks?
•	 Is the frequency and intensity of cyberattacks against your organization increasing over time and/or what is the 
(changing) nature and vectors of these attacks? What measures has your organization taken to mitigate the 
likelihood and/or impact of the attacks?
•	 Do you complete background checks on all new employees who have access to confidential or private data?
•	 	Do you have software to identify and escalate inappropriate access to data, attempts to transfer confidential or 
private data outside of your organization?
•	 	Do you know how often confidential or private data is emailed outside your organization to private email 
addresses?
•	 	Have you found ransomware on an internal server or drive? If yes, was a root cause analysis completed to 
determine who saved it there and when?
•	 	Have you ever utilized a Dark Web scan to determine what the hackers are saying about your organization?
•	 	Do you have sufficient training and tabletop exercises with leadership to discuss how to respond and manage a 
ransomware attack?
Red Flags 
•	 Employees do not receive any training on cyber security risks
•	 Internal phishing programs continue to see multiple employees clicking on links that could be a real phishing 
attempt
•	 	Your IT security function has not taken steps to obtain assurance over the security measures implemented by your 
cloud service provider
•	 The Internal Audit function has not conducted cyber security audits in an extended period
•	 	The Dark Web identifies that hackers are discussing your organization or trading in your stolen data
Related risks 
•	 Insider threat causing cyber risk or data exfiltration
•	 Ransomware attack
•	 Deepfake social engineering 
•	 Weak operations technology governance
•	 The Internet of Things creating cyber exposure
•	 	Critical infrastructure at risk
•	 	Controls weakened by shift to hybrid workforce 
•	 	Data privacy breach
•	 	Supply chain risk
•	 	Non-compliance

OpenAI released ChatGPT for public use in November 2022, giving many users their first eye-opening glimpse at the 
immense power — and disruptive potential — of generative artificial intelligence. Initial reviews marveled at how 
realistic computer-generated text appeared and the seemingly infinite number of cost-saving use cases, but potential 
stumbling blocks appeared just as quickly.
Almost everyone who has interacted with ChatGPT and similar generative artificial intelligence frameworks has 
experienced a so-called hallucination: The algorithm seems to go rogue and volunteer data that is incorrect, was not 
requested, or generally does not align with the prompt. 
Subsequent updates have reduced the frequency of these hallucinations. Still, it may not be possible to eliminate 
them entirely. AI can interpret a question posed to it in any number of ways depending on how that question is asked, 
and the same prompt can result in infinite different outputs. Users, therefore, need to apply considerable scrutiny 
regarding how they engage with AI and the usefulness of AI text, imagery, and computer code when using these tools 
at scale. 
Additional concerns surround the data sources used to train AI applications and the opportunities for misuse. 
Inputting sensitive or proprietary data (intentional or not) into AI could lead to significant privacy breaches, cases of 
intellectual property theft, or copyright infringement. Threat actors could deploy AI solutions to craft sophisticated 
and highly believable social engineering attacks. Students could use it to cheat on university papers. 
Perhaps the most important takeaway from the world of AI in 2023 is that organizations and individuals will ignore it 
at their peril. The technology is advancing far more rapidly than anyone anticipated, and we’ve only just scratched the 
surface in understanding the myriad ways it will permeate our lives for better and worse.

AI is everywhere: What are your opportunities and risks? 
Jason Lee | AI, Data, and Analytics
7
Key questions to ask 
•	 Do you have an inventory of all the technology, systems, processes, and job descriptions that have been — or may 
be — impacted by AI?
•	 Does the organization have a risk assessment process for all new technology or AI being considered or 
implemented? 
•	 	Have you asked your critical third parties and suppliers as to how they plan to incorporate AI into their technology, 
systems, and processes?

confidential data
•	 	Operational issues, resulting from AI not making 
accurate judgments 
•	 	Cybersecurity vulnerabilities
•	 	Plagiarism
•	 If ignored, loss of competitive advantage

Privacy and Data Governance
Are you confident your data is secure and used ethically? 
Adriana Gliga | PCI, Privacy, and Data Governance
Québec introduced stringent regulations in September 2022 which will have downstream impacts across Canada in 
the years to come. Law 25 includes numerous provisions and penalties which go far beyond the current requirements 
of the federal Personal Information and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). Law 25 is equalled only by Europe’s 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) — widely accepted as the most robust legislation anywhere in the world.
Law 25 already has teeth beyond Québec’s borders, as it applies to any organization (Canadian or international) that 
does business in the province or stores personal identifiable information (PII) on Québec residents. Given the trend 
toward greater accountability and stewardship over PII, it is only a matter of time before other provinces and the 
federal government follow suit with enhancing existing privacy laws.
Stricter regulations present both an obstacle and an opportunity for organizations that have come to rely on data 
for critical insights and market opportunities. Compliance will require significant updates to policies and procedures 
governing the collection, use, and transmission of data. These will need to be resilient to the numerous and often 
differing privacy regulations organizations are exposed to across the various jurisdictions they do business in. It will 
also require that organizations be more transparent with how and why they collect user data and who it will be 
shared with — potentially triggering some uncomfortable conversations. 
Many organizations will lament the potential financial costs of hiring new privacy officer, curtailing analytics 
programs which are beyond the scope of why data is collected, implementing additional strategies to ensure 
compliance, and any regulatory fines they might face. 
At the same time, it’s worth noting that users are already much more aware of how much organizations value 
their data and the risks involved with sharing it. This is shifting the competitive edge to those entities that can 
demonstrate when, how, and why PII will be used, and the mechanisms they’ve put in place to protect it. 
9
Key questions to ask 
•	 Are you confident that private and confidential data is kept in a secure location with sufficient controls?
•	 	Do you understand which privacy laws apply to your organization and the related compliance requirements?
•	 	Has your organization identified where all critical data is stored and how is moves between systems and 
jurisdictions?
•	 	Do you know if your private and confidential data may have lost integrity and/or adequate segmentation in the 
transition to new digital systems (i.e., the cloud)?
•	 	Is it possible for a third-party to gain inappropriate access to your critical data?
•	 	Does your organization have a policy in relation to the use of AI tools such as Chat GPT and the management of 
confidential or personally identifiable information?
Red Flags 
•	 	Inability to isolate personal identifiable information and confidential data
•	 	No training or policy related to data governance and controls
•	 	No policy in relation to AI tools such as ChatGPT
•	 	Minimal use of data analytics for decision support or risk assessment given data is private and confidential
•	 	History of data breaches
Related risks 
•	 Privacy breaches due to lack of governance around AI 
and third-party solutions
•	 	Emerging legislative impacts on the use of third-party 
data sets may increase non-compliance risk
•	 	Impacts of transparency requirements on cross-channel 
management of user preferences and experience
•	 	Increasing Insider risks due to remote/hybrid 
environment and turnover
•	 	Regulatory non-compliance

IT/OT Governance
Are you optimizing value from limited resources and budgets?
Drew Buhr | Cyber Security Risk
Hash Qureshi | Enterprise Risk Services
Organizations have limited budgets to invest in information (IT) and operational (OT) technology , physical 
infrastructure, and security. Executives may be tempted to answer to this challenge by foregoing necessary upgrades 
and transformation initiatives. But just as there are costs to innovation, there are also risks to allowing legacy systems to 
continue beyond their useful lifespan. 
The question isn’t whether to resist or embrace digital transformation; rather, it’s deciding which initiatives to prioritize 
right now and how to get the best return on the technology investment. Inefficient systems and processes are a drain 
on morale and productivity. Restricting innovation and transformation will only lead to individual departments making 
unilateral technology decisions without considering the impact beyond their operational silos. 
Arriving at the best answer as to which technology investments should be prioritized and drive greatest value requires 
proper governance — with input across the organization, including IT, finance, operations, internal audit (or risk officer), 
and other relevant stakeholders. Conversations need to consider the current business challenges, the effectiveness of 
existing systems, and any threats (existing or emerging) to security and privacy. Leaders also need to have a strong grasp 
of the innovation pipeline and the areas where disruption and business interruption are most likely. 
All infrastructure will eventually come to the end of its useful life. Every replacement option will eventually include some 
type of cloud solution and, eventually, AI-enabled upgrades. Recognizing this, leaders need to set a tone from the top 
that breeds confidence that the right updates will occur at the right time. They also need the appropriate processes in 
place to ensure the chosen upgrades will be the best fit for the organization, and the right advisors provide due regard to 
the opportunities and risks each option brings to the table. 
11
Key questions to ask 
•	 Has your organization made sub-optimal investments in technology and has a root cause analysis been completed 
to determine why?
•	 	Does your organization rely on third parties to maintain effective control over IT and OT? What is the vetting 
process for third party  suppliers and what risks need to be managed?
•	 	Do you have sufficient training and tabletop exercises with leadership to discuss how to respond and manage a 
ransomware attack?
•	 	Is the IT/OT budget sufficient to cover the most critical needs of your organization?
•	 	Do you foresee any big changes to your data or system architecture that might disrupt controls, process, or policy 
related to IT and OT?
•	 	Has a strategy been established to guide technology investments with a view to ensuring technology is renewed on 
a timely basis and optimizing the business?
Red Flags 
•	 History of sub-optimal IT/OT decision making (I.e., excessive spending)
•	 	IT/OT third parties seen as the root cause of issues
•	 	Employees with no knowledge of acceptable and unacceptable technology practices
•	 	Operational issues related to system failures
Related risks 
•	 Suboptimal IT/OT decisions reducing control 
effectiveness
•	 	Lack of / insufficient supervision of third parties 
and related controls
•	 	Insufficient policy, progress, contracts, and training 
on the proper/expected use of IT and OT
•	 	Ineffective communication amongst leadership 
and the board

Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)
Are you getting the balance right? 
Edward Olson | ESG Leader 
Mary Larson | Organizational Renewal
Len Nanjad | Organization Change Management
In 2023, the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) issued two new standards related to sustainability 
disclosure and reporting (IFRS S1 & S2). This year also saw new Canadian legislation (Bill S-211) related to 
organizations’ responsibility to mitigate the use of forced labour and child labour in their supply chains. These 
measures are only the beginning of what is likely to be an onslaught of ESG-related regulation and legislation in the 
years to come. 
It is imperative that organizations not only be proactive in aligning with these standards, but also anticipate the 
environmental, social, and governance requirements around the corner. It’s clear that ESG is not a passing trend, nor 
is it likely to be a partisan issue that waxes and wanes with the election cycle. Electors want to see businesses take 
more accountability for the impacts of their business decisions. Governments are responding by drafting laws with 
sharper teeth, and many organizations are at risk of being caught unprepared.
Most of the focus to date has been on the environment, and, to a lesser extent, social issues such as the above-
mentioned problem of indentured servitude and human trafficking. In time we will see more and more focus on the 
social and governance elements of ESG. 
Organizations have an opportunity to get ahead of the conversation. Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) is one area 
of focus that organizations will want to be paying attention to in the year ahead (social) — especially as it relates to 
representation on boards and senior leadership positions (governance). It’s also foreseeable that transparency around 
corporate donations, sustainability reporting, and executive compensation will continue to gain traction as a new 
area of focus for the ISSB. 
At the same time, it would be ill advised to lose focus on the environmental pillar altogether considering the record-
breaking heat this summer and unprecedented number of wildfires. If anything, pressure will only increase for 
organizations to quantify, report, and curtail their greenhouse gas emissions. 
13
Key questions to ask 
•	 Has your organization set realistic and defendable ESG targets that are respectable in relation to peers in your 
industry?
•	 	Have you assessed the impact of inaction or insufficient progress in driving ESG-related changes?
•	 	Are you confident that you can trust the integrity of the data used to calculate your ESG metrics?
•	 	Are any of your targets going to be difficult or even impossible to achieve? If yes, you must determine if you want 
to continue with this target.
•	 	Do you know how your employees or external stakeholders view the ESG targets of your company? Are they 
content or disappointed? Is there risk that this could have a negative impact on the culture or perception of your 
organization?
Red Flags 
•	 	Lack of climate change mitigation, environment, and biodiversity strategies and detailed plans
•	 	Weak governance architecture around emergency and incident preparedness
•	 	Increased reports of harassment or discrimination, unwanted turnover, challenges in hiring, low/declining 
engagement scores
•	 	Lack of rigorous EDI strategy (linked to corporate strategy) or failure to deliver on the strategy
•	 	Links with suppliers or contractors involved in human rights abuses, lack of supply chain transparency
•	 	Increased health and safety violations
•	 	Lack of community engagement, lawsuits, public protests, negative media coverage
•	 	Material increase in whistleblower tips (i.e., corruption and bribery)
•	 Lack of clarity around responsibility for fraud prevention
Related risks 
•	 Rising costs and complexity related to increasing 
regulatory requirements and disclosures
•	 	Physical impacts of climate change, pollution, 
biodiversity loss, and water scarcity
•	 	Increased accountability for supplier and contractor 
practices throughout the supply chain
•	 	Occupational health issues, unsafe working 
conditions
•	 	Inadequate community engagement, particularly 
with Indigenous Peoples 
•	 	Lack of diversity, biased decision-making, unequal 
opportunities, and suboptimal organizational 
culture
•	 	Corruption and fraud
•	 	Compensation practices: Board and C-suite
•	 	Increased scrutiny on taxes and foreign investments

IT Third-Party Risk Management 
How well do you really know your third parties?  
Hash Qureshi | Enterprise Risk Services
Richard Arthurs | Enterprise Risk Services
Gord Chalk | Supply Chain 
Canadian companies are more reliant on third parties for the provision of technology related services than at any 
other time in history — a trend that has been accelerated by the rate of digital innovation throughout and since the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The reasons for this are severalfold.
One is that many organizations are struggling to find the expertise needed to manage technology at the rate they’re 
adopting it. This has been amplified by the ongoing labour shortage which is forcing many IT functions to split their 
focus between recruiting for IT needs and supporting other areas of the business. 
There are also numerous instances where it makes good financial sense to outsource IT support. New roles are 
emerging as the sector becomes increasingly specialized. Specialist expertise is also more expensive than ever and it’s 
hard to justify hiring an employee whose skills may not be required on a full-time basis.
Moreover, the broad definition of third parties doesn’t include just the individual contractors and consultants who 
perform specialist work. Software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers are now ubiquitous, covering everything from day-to-
day administrative tools (word processors, email, storage servers, etc.) to finance, inventory, and logistics systems. 
Organizations are trusting external vendors with more information and access to their networks than ever before. 
While there are certainly instances where this is logical, even necessary, the sense that this has become the new 
status quo can easily breed complacency. 
Third-party liability clauses, managing third-party access permissions, and regularly conducting cyber security threat 
assessments cannot become another box to tick when a new third party is brought on board. These must be reviewed 
and stress tested regularly with the express purpose of finding and remediating the weak links associated with those 
third-party dependencies. 
15
Key questions to ask 
•	 How many new third-party contracts has your company setup since 2020?
•	 	Does your organization complete a detailed risk assessment before setting up contracts with third parties? Is risk 
mitigation accountability identified in the contract?
•	 	Do your business resilience and disaster recovery plans take into consideration the accountabilities of specific third 
parties? Are these third parties prepared to act on your behalf when needed? 
•	 	Do the third parties you depend upon have appropriate response plans in place in the event of a disruption to their 
organizations? Have these plans been tested? 
•	 	What steps have you taken to ensure the operating effectiveness and resiliency of the third party you are relying 
upon?
•	 	Do you have a customized code of conduct and training for third parties? Does this include cyber security 
expectations?
Red Flags 
•	 Excessive complaints related to third parties
•	 	Whistleblower tips
•	 	System quality and performance issues
Related risks 
•	 Cyber security and privacy risk exposure
•	 	Fraud
•	 	Quality and/or project management issues
•	 	System outages
Merger and Acquisition (M&A) Integration 
Are you aware of the risks you are inheriting with your acquisition?   
Mike Reynolds | Mergers and Acquisitions Advisory
James Dyack | Valuations and Litigation Support
Johnny Earl | Due Diligence
Mark Reynolds | Mergers and Acquisitions Advisory
Following a sizable dip during the pandemic, Canadian M&A activity is back on the upswing. Private equity firms and 
growth-minded businesses will be eager to capitalize on the increased transaction volume, but they should also be 
mindful of the changing risk landscape during the due diligence process.
Major dealbreakers such as financial mismanagement or pending litigation must still be top of mind for potential 
buyers. However, we also know that instances of fraud and corruption spiked during the pandemic — much of which 
has yet to be uncovered or reported. Many organizations have also haphazardly introduced new digital platforms and 
tools over the past three years. Poor integrations could be costly to fix, while cyber vulnerabilities may open the door 
for a crippling attack if they’re not quickly weeded out and remediated. 
While these risk areas may not be immediately obvious, the company’s approach to governance can be revealing. 
Other areas that require a deeper look include the business’s ESG exposures and the steps they’ve taken to quantify 
and improve exposures within the business and across their supply chain. This is especially relevant for private equity 
firms whose investors may be expecting progress in the areas of sustainability, diversity, and social welfare. Also, 
the internal climate within the business and how cultural issues have impacted its ability to attract and retain key 
employees is critical. 
Companies that have an effective enterprise risk management and/or internal audit function will be easier to assess 
for potential fit and value across all risk areas. Those that don’t may still be a viable M&A target; but they will require 
increased scrutiny — and the costs of addressing key risk areas need to be factored into the final valuation and post-
merger integration plan. 
17
Key questions to ask 
•	 Does your due diligence process include IT/OT controls and governance, ability to meet investor ESG expectations, 
an awareness of any risk related to fraud and corruption, cultural issues, and proactive enterprise risk management 
activities?
•	 	Are you clear at the outset which factors would be dealbreakers and have you set parameters for a “no-go” 
decision?
•	 	Have you ever disqualified a merger or acquisition due to an unacceptable level of risk? Based on this, what do you 
feel is the risk appetite of the board and executive?
Red Flags 
•	 New cyber, ESG, fraud, or corruption issues related to acquisitions or mergers
•	 	Errors found in data
•	 	Excessive cost and time required to achieve integration targets
•	 	Morale issues and excessive turnover
Related risks 
•	 IT/OT Governance, controls, and specifically cyber risk
•	 	Data and system integrity issues
•	 	Cultures in conflict
•	 	Inability to achieve required synergies
Digital Transformation  
Have you envisioned the opportunity and risks of the end state?   
Jason Lee | Machine Learning and AI
Len Nanjad | Organization Change Management
Soumya Ghosh | Digital Transformation and Advisory
Wendy Gnenz | Digital Strategy and Planning 
The pandemic forced many companies and governments to expedite long-term digital transformation plans. Cloud-
enabled capabilities have been a common feature among transformation initiatives to accommodate enhanced 
e-commerce and the needs of a remote and geographically dispersed workforce. The cloud has also found its way 
into advanced hardware as organizations seek more data on (and how to improve the performance of) physical 
systems. 
While many new platforms seek to replace aging and outdated infrastructure, it would be short sighted to treat these 
upgrades as like for like replacements. For example, a cloud enterprise resource planning platform can perform many 
of the same functions as on-premises accounting software, but it also introduces new processes and risk exposures. 
Each cloud update introduces a new potential point of entry for cyber criminals and adds to the organization’s overall 
third-party risk calculus. Relying on default user access settings can also increase the risk of insider threats, while 
poor or incomplete training can diminish data quality and the resulting return on investment. These side effects exist 
throughout the digital transformation value chain and compound with each new platform that is introduced. 
The introduction of new software may also require updates — not just to hardware or other supporting infrastructure 
to ensure it is secure and operates as intended, but also to support integration with remaining legacy systems. 
Moreover, it is necessary to review related policies, procedures, and risk assessments that govern the use of 
technology and update these as required. Digital transformation can also have a material impact on an organization’s 
strategy, business model, and human resourcing requirements — creating an increased need for specialist knowledge 
in some areas and making other roles redundant. 
19
Key questions to ask 
•	 	Do you have an inventory of all the planned changes and changes already made related to digital transformation?
•	 	Have the integration requirements with legacy systems been identified and assessed?
•	 	Post digital transformation, do you know what controls, policies, procedures, training materials, and job 
descriptions need to be updated to remain effective and relevant?
•	 	Will your organization need added resources with new capabilities to be able to effectively and efficiently use the 
new technology?
•	 	How much training will be required for employees to learn how to use the new technology?
•	 Has the number and types of cyber attacks changed since your digital transformation started?
•	 How will you determine whether the intended benefits from the transformation were realized and whether there 
are any lessons to be learned?
Red Flags 
•	 Increased number or complexity of cyberattacks
•	 	Evidence of unauthorized access to systems and access to data
•	 	System failures or downtime
•	 	Data inaccuracies and reporting errors
•	 	Excessive costs and service required
•	 	User complaints
•	 	Training, policies, and procedures out of date
Related risks 
•	 Cybersecurity threats
•	 	Data privacy concerns
•	 	Integration complexities
•	 	Dependency on technology providers
•	 	Cost overruns
•	 	Resistance to change
•	 	Skills gap
•	 	Regulatory non-compliance
•	 	System downtime
•	 	Lack of digital transformation strategy
•	 	Data quality issues

Data Analytics and Continuous Monitoring   
Do you feel competitors have better insights? 
Ian Shaule | Advanced Analytics
Colin Wenngatz | Retail Analytics
Cameron Ollenberger | Risk Analytics
Olena Batuev | Data Analytics
Reliance on analytics has skyrocketed over the last decade with the rapid advancement of cloud-based platforms and 
tools. The amount and sources of data have also increased significantly with the digitization of business processes and 
the increased affordability of internet-connected sensors and digital twins (i.e., elaborate computer-aided simulations 
of physical infrastructure, often used for testing and analysis). 
Analytics can add immeasurable value to internal audits by providing decision support, helping to monitor critical 
performance measures and targets, revealing potential fraud risks, and much more. Data-driven insights can also 
drive entire business models by helping to forecast consumer demand, target ads, streamline logistics and supply 
chains, and optimize costs throughout the value chain. 
And where there are significant opportunities, there is also considerable risk. 
Two opposing forces that organizations need to balance are the risks of moving too slowly or too quickly in advancing 
analytics capabilities. Failing to prioritize analytics will result in slower growth relative to competitors and a sharp 
decline in market share over the near to medium term. On the other hand, the race for better insights can lead 
organizations to skip critical steps in resourcing, governance, and strategy. Gaining the wrong insights from data can 
be even more detrimental than not having any insights. 
Analytics are table stakes in 2023. However, data integrity and confidence in the quality of analytic-driven insight 
must be the guiding forces behind its ongoing maturity. Priority one should be to add analytic expertise at the board 
and operational levels — including internal audit. Next should be to assess the quality of existing data and existing 
policies and practices to ensure data quality. Third should be to create (or re-assess) the organization’s strategy for 
maturing the analytics program and securing executive buy in on that roadmap. 
21
Key questions to ask 
•	 When was the last time you tested the integrity of your data? Has anything changed that might have impacted the 
integrity of your data?
•	 	Do you have a material reliance on data from third parties (I.e., ESG metrics)? Are you confident this data has 
integrity?
•	 	Are you confident in the accuracy of the output of your data analytics? Especially the analytics used for material 
insight and decision making.
•	 	Are you losing market share or seeing an increase in complaints because you do not have the same quality of 
information and insight as your competitors?
Red Flags 
•	 Lack of data integrity
•	 Ambiguous findings
•	 	Missing value proposition
•	 	Lack of technical or industry experience
•	 	Data analytics are too simple or too complex
•	 Lack of audit committee buy in
Related risks 
•	 Internal audit (IA) becomes redundant as business 
outpaces it in use of analytics and technology
•	 	Business assumes IA only looks backwards and does 
not embrace innovation. IA is no longer invited to 
the table
•	 	The business is losing market share to the competition
•	 	The failure rate of innovation is higher than your 
peer set
•	 	The business does not have early warning indicators 
of issues or negative trends

Workforce Transformation & 
Organizational Readiness   
Are you optimizing and sustaining value from critical resources? 
Mary Larson | Organizational Renewal 
Len Nanjad | Organization Change Management 
There has been a seismic shift in the working world over the past decade: new technologies have created new roles 
and increased the need for specialist expertise. The widespread adoption of remote and hybrid work arrangements 
during COVID is having a material impact on corporate cultures and well-established management practices. And 
the continued globalization of businesses and supply chains is pushing many jobs overseas, making internal teams 
smaller and more focused on supplier management. 
Generational changes are also shifting approaches to recruitment and retention as more baby boomers retire and 
Gen Z continues to establish its place in the workforce. The former tended to stay with employers for the long term 
and follow along with organizational norms and best practices. Whereas younger professionals appear to be more 
open to pursuing roles with different employers and more vocal about their expectations for greater work/life balance 
as well as more diverse, inclusive, and socially conscious cultures. 
For organizations, these trends all raise important questions about how best to attract and retain the critical 
resources that are needed to create operational and strategic value. 
The so-called Great Resignation through 2020 and 2021 highlighted an overall lack of readiness among many 
organizations which quickly found themselves unable to deliver on key business priorities. While the pandemic served 
as an inflection point, leaders and executives will be wise to recognize that the underlying cause — inflexibility, 
resistance to change, stagnant culture, etc. — remains a risk area that will become more, not less, volatile in the years 
to come. 
Organizations that recognize these challenges and take proactive steps to address their organizational readiness (i.e., 
increase employee morale, support health and wellness, provide competitive salary and benefits, strike the right 
balance between employee growth and autonomy, etc.) will find themselves in the best position to realize strategic 
value in an increasingly chaotic environment. 
23
Key questions to ask 
•	 	Does your culture support the optimization of strategic success, or is it making it harder to succeed?
•	 	Is your resource turnover exceeding industry averages? Has it changed in the last three years?
•	 	Is the morale of your workforce positive or are their reasons to be concerned?
•	 	Do you provide sufficient compensation, benefits, training, and development?
•	 	Is there an elevated risk of labour disruption (i.e., Unions, etc.)?
•	 	Do you have sufficient succession planning for all critical roles in your organization?
•	 	Do your incentive structures promote the right behaviours and do the resonate across all generations?
Red Flags 
•	 Existing controls do not support agile change management or team member autonomy
•	 	AI/automation tools reveal discrepancy between stated and measured engagement, wellness, and change 
readiness
•	 	Increased turnover, leave, mental health usage, policy violations related to digital transformation initiatives
•	 	Increased turnover or lack of engagement
•	 	Increase interest in unionizing and regulatory challenges
Related risks 
•	 Getting and keeping the right people 
•	 	Misunderstanding generational needs and nuances
•	 	Increasing use of AI applications to support change 
management and behavior change
•	 	Inadequate monitoring and support of health and 
wellness, especially mental health and wellness
•	 	Remote work as a right, not a privilege
Insurance
Read the fine print: Do you really know the current costs and 
benefits of insurance?  
Craig Burkart | Insurance Advisory 
An unprecedented number of hurricanes, floods, wildfires, droughts, and numerous cyber and privacy breaches have 
led to a record number of insurance claims throughout 2022 and 2023. This has led to an increase in the cost of 
insurance, uninsurable assets, and the complexity of terms and conditions related to acceptable claims.
As a result, organizations are finding that insurance is becoming far less affordable and far more difficult to access. 
And it’s getting harder to make a claim even for those that are insured. 
The current challenges are only the tip of the spear. 2023 is on pace to become the hottest year on record and it’s 
likely that climate-related events will only become more severe and damaging in the coming decade. There’s also 
reason to fear the looming impact of AI on the cyber risk landscape among other risk areas. 
Organizations can no longer rely exclusively on insurance to mitigate a large percentage of risk. Those that do will 
find themselves increasingly at the behest of insurers to put relevant practices, policies, and governance in place. 
While this may lead to improved risk management, it’s worth reiterating that insurers have a clear incentive to 
prioritize their own interests no matter the cost to the insured. 
Moving forward, boards and executives must seek to gain a better understanding of their overall risk landscape — 
including the potential for business interruptions due to natural disasters, greenwashing, cyber attacks, pandemics, 
supply chain interruptions, etc. This will require some difficult decisions around which risks the company should 
absorb and/or mitigate independently and which to outsource to insurance. 
It may also be a good time to contact an independent insurance advisor who can help to quantify coverage amounts 
and rates and determine whether the coverages are worth the investment.  
25
Key questions to ask 
•	 How does the organization plan to navigate significant increases in insurance rates, especially those related to 
cyber insurance?
•	 	Has your overall insurance coverage of risk exposure decreased over the last few years? How does this change the 
organization’s overall risk management strategy?
•	 	How could utilizing an insurance expert assist with optimizing insurance claims? Did you know many policies cover 
the cost of an insurance expert to support your claim?
•	 	Have you ever audited the value optimization of your insurance coverage?
Red Flags 
•	 Last-minute insurance renewal
•	 	Claims not properly paid
•	 	Insufficient values
•	 	Board and senior management not aware of renewals or amounts
•	 	Material rate increases
Related risks 
•	 Lack of oversight for renewals or amounts
•	 	Insurance renewals not timely and/or incomplete 
•	 	Insurance program not matching the risks
•	 	Improperly set insurance values
•	 	Significant increase in rates and claim requirements
Economic and Financial Adversity 
How has the economy impacted your business model?  
Mike Reynolds | Mergers and Acquisitions Advisory
Mark Reynolds | Mergers and Acquisitions Advisory
James Dyack | Valuations and Litigation Support
Richard Arthurs | Enterprise Risk
Giovanni Worsley | Property Tax
Lee Thiessen | Real Estate and Construction 
The Canadian economy remains in uncertain waters through 2023 as rising interest rates have struggled to cool 
stubbornly high inflation. While consumer spending has so far been resilient, there are growing fears the rising costs 
of food, fuel, and housing will push more households to the financial margins. 
Businesses are also feeling the side effects of economic turbulence, with many choosing to hold fast until they have a 
better idea of whether a recession is coming and/or how severe it might be. 
Capital management is a particular concern. Organizations are understandably reticent to hire, take on debt, or invest 
in infrastructure projects for fear of limiting cashflow if the economy contracts. On the other end, a tight labour 
market is keeping up the pressure to retain key employees, which includes demands to help them keep up with the 
rising cost of living. 
Just as there are consequences to making the wrong decisions (e.g., expanding into new markets right before a 
downturn, downsizing just before the economy improves), doing nothing is not a better option. 
Instead, organizations should be using this opportunity to pressure test business models to ensure they are resilient 
to any economic scenario that may arise in 2024. Where are the inefficiencies? What areas are underperforming? 
How will trends, technologies, and consumer behaviours shift in the next three to five years? This process can help to 
overcome decision making paralysis by identifying inefficiencies, opportunities, and core risk areas.
Investing in the right areas now will not only make the business more resilient to a potential recession, but also put it 
in a position to thrive when the economy starts growing again. 
27
Key questions to ask 
•	 How has the economy and decreased disposable income impacted your business model?
•	 	Are there early signs and risk trends that you should be preparing for?
•	 	Is your business model resilient enough to withstand ongoing economic challenge?
•	 	Are you monitoring specific success and risk metrics? 
•	 	How are you managing your cashflow to ensure adequate funds to cover off obligations?
Red Flags 
•	 Shrinking margins
•	 	Low cash flow
•	 	Decreasing customer demand
Related risks 
•	 Increased cost of debt
•	 	Reduced consumer demand
•	 	Continued but decreasing inflation
•	 	Increasing input costs
•	 	Continued supply chain constraints
Business Resilience 
(Including Third Parties) 
How do you respond when crisis hits?   
Cliff Trollope | Business Resilience
Businesses face an ever-growing list of threats to their ability to operate, grow, and remain profitable. Serious threats 
over the past decade have included a global pandemic, natural disasters, significant demographic changes and shifts 
in consumer behaviour, disruptive technologies, a massive rise in cyber attacks, and generationally high inflation. 
The next 10 years will bring even more challenges, not the least of which are increased impacts of climate change and 
global pressure to transition from fossil fuels, and the rapid advancement of AI.
Given the growing number and magnitude of potentially existential crises — and the shrinking timespan from one 
challenge to the next — it’s clear that preparation is key. Leaders need to be ready to respond quickly and make 
decisive decisions when faced with a sudden and serious threat to the business. They also need to be confident that 
their vendors will be ready to respond swiftly with the right expertise at the right time. 
Nobody can predict when the next pandemic or natural disaster will strike. Still, organizations can learn a lot from the 
outcomes and impacts of past crises on their own business and those of peer organizations. Coupled with frequent 
risk assessments, these lessons can inform scenario planning, tabletop exercises, and emergency response plans that 
cover the highest priority threats.
Ideally, these exercises will include participation from relevant third-party vendors such as cyber managed service 
providers, cloud vendors, co-sourced or outsourced internal auditors, business advisors, and others. The goal here 
isn’t necessarily to successfully navigate the crisis. Rather, it is to identify critical weaknesses in existing emergency 
response plans such as difficulty mobilizing resources, potential safety issues, and areas where the business is most 
likely to lose customers and/or money. 
29
Key questions to ask 
•	 Does your organization maintain a list of probable risk scenarios it should be prepared for, including plans on how it 
will respond to those scenarios?
•	 	Has your leadership ever conducted mock tabletop scenarios to discuss how you would manage a crisis? If yes, do 
you involve an expert in this discussion?
•	 	Has your organization experienced a real crisis or at least a material unexpected disruption? If yes, did you conduct 
a post analysis of this situation to discuss what worked well, what did not work well, and what you must be better 
prepared for?
•	 	Do you keep track of crises that have impacted peer companies and assessed whether you are prepared to 
respond? Usually if it can happen to a similar organization, it could also happen to you. 
Red Flags 
•	 Insufficient preparation (training, discussions, policy, or plans)
•	 	Third parties not aware of role in business resilience
•	 	Business not prepared for past business disruption situations
•	 	Competitors negatively impacted by disruption not expected by industry
Related risks 
•	 Business and IT/OT disruption
•	 	Inability to coordinate a timely response and 
organized communication
•	 	In time of need, critical resources are not available or 
do not understand their roles
•	 	Excessive costs required to react to needs
Capital Projects and Operations 
Are your projects being managed to mitigate the risk of budget 
overruns, extended timelines, and poor quality?    
Richard Arthurs | Enterprise Risk
Gord Chalk | Energy and Utilities
Olena Batuev | Data Analytics 
Cameron Ollenberger | Risk Analytics 
Capital projects are some of the most expensive investments a company will ever make. These can range in the 
billions of dollars and typically carry a high risk of cost overruns, especially with inflationary pressures on labour and 
materials. 
The expectation that capital projects almost always come in overbudget can, itself, lead organizations to pay far 
more — and take on more risk — than necessary. 
One reason is that most capital projects see some error in billing. It is common for a project to inflate by one to 
three percent due to erroneous billing. That could mean up to $30 million on a billion-dollar project. Organizations 
that are embarking on capital projects can mitigate the risk of overpaying through the targeted use of data analytics 
to compare invoices and requisitions to identify inconsistencies. They could then use this data to collect back when 
overbilled or defend their case in court. 
Other risks associated with capital projects include quality issues which can compromise both the health and safety 
of employees and contractors leading to costly downtime and unexpected maintenance. Addressing these issues 
before construction starts is the most effective way to protect people, an organization’s reputation, as well as its 
bottom line. 
Aside from the typical design, budgeting, and tendering proposals for capital projects, appropriate project 
management can help to ensure that timelines, materials, and costs all align with expectations. This function should 
be accountable for inspections and status updates throughout the project lifecycle to validate that the work is being 
performed as agreed, complies with relevant standards, and meets the specifications set out in engineering plans. 
It is also critical that the initiative also go through a rigorous risk assessment as part of the planning process. This lens 
can help to identify flaws in the design, anticipate how delays and overruns will impact the business, and identify 
potential project management issues — including risks to safety and the environment. 
31
Key questions to ask 
•	 	Does your organization have the requisite experience to manage large scale capital projects? If not, how will it 
resource the expertise required to successfully deliver the project?
•	 	How will you monitor the timely delivery of the project ensuring it remains on budget?
•	 	Have clear roles and responsibilities for both project delivery and project oversight been established?
•	 	Are there unique design and implementation elements with this project, or is this something the engineering, 
procurement, and construction firm has done before?
•	 Are the vendor contracts set up as fixed fee or will they be time and materials? Do you have the contract set up 
with a right to audit clause and a defined dispute resolution process?
Red Flags 
•	 Onsite health and safety issues
•	 	Vendor billing errors
•	 	Regulatory non-compliance instances
•	 	Legal issues
•	 	Material cost overruns
•	 	Timeline extensions
•	 	Engineering, procurement, and construction resource turnover
Related risks 
•	 Budget overruns and timeline delays
•	 	Vendors who are not qualified to perform the 
work as required
•	 	Poorly designed vendor contracts 
•	 	Health and safety incidents
•	 	Vendor billing issues
•	 Quality concerns
32
Fraud and Corruption 
How much has the cost of living increase impacted fraud risk?   
Lisa Majeau-Gordon | Forensics
Richard Arthurs | Enterprise Risk 
All Canadians have experienced significant increases to the cost of living throughout 2022 and 2023 due to rampant 
inflation and interest rates at their highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis. Some have been particularly 
hard hit. MNP’s July 2023 Consumer Debt Index revealed that 52 percent of households were $200 or less away from 
financial insolvency and more than a third already didn’t make enough to cover their monthly living expenses. 
While leaders are right to be concerned about their employees’ wellbeing and welfare, organizations should also be 
keeping a watchful eye to the increased risk of theft and fraud within the business. 
There are typically three factors which influence the likelihood that a fraud will occur, two of which have been 
significantly elevated over the past 18 months. One is pressure; the perpetrator feels compelled to commit fraud 
because they need the money. Another is rationalization; the perpetrator convinces themselves the ends justify the 
means. 
Given the economic drivers and other (often personal) factors at play, senior leaders and internal auditors will find 
it difficult to mitigate those first two elements of the fraud triangle. However, it is still important to recognize that 
these are elevated right now. That makes it even more critical to understand and manage the third determinant of 
fraud, which is opportunity. 
Remote work, incomplete policies, poor training, and ineffective controls can all lead to increased opportunity for 
fraud to occur. Regular risk assessments should seek to identify additional opportunity-related fraud risks unique to 
the organization. 
Taking steps like requiring dual signatures for large transactions, using AI tools to monitor for suspicious activity, 
restricting login access to the smallest number of individuals can all help to reduce fraud. Providing fraud training and 
encouraging team members to report suspicious activity has also proven to be extremely effective. 
33
Key questions to ask 
•	 Are you aware of how much pressure the current economic conditions have had on your employees and third 
parties? Is there anything you can do proactively to help reduce this pressure related to cost of living (allow remote 
working, etc.)?
•	 	Have your organization or peers experienced an increase in fraudulent activities?
•	 	Have you conducted a fraud risk assessment recently?
•	 	Do you have experts in fraud investigation? Often forensic experts are engaged to assist with investigations. Do not 
assume internal audit has this expertise.
•	 	Have you ever used advanced data analytics to detect fraud risk or to find real incidence of fraud in your 
organization?
Red Flags 
•	 Employees living beyond their means
•	 	Growing morale issues
•	 	Employees who never take time off or work at odd times (I.e., stat holidays and weekends)
•	 	Excessive overtime, sales returns, damaged product, refunds, coupon redemption, etc.
•	 	Third parties with cash flow issues
•	 	Excessive manual transactions or transactions off the books
•	 	No code of conduct or expense reporting policy, or controls (i.e., training)
•	 Doing business in highly corrupt countries
Related risks 
•	 Financial loss
•	 	Legal and regulatory issues
•	 	Fines
•	 	Business interruption
•	 	Negative impact on reputation
