As noted in Chapter 1, nearly two-\nthirds (63%) of respondents to the GRPS predict a \nturbulent or stormy outlook, with upheavals and an \nelevated risk of global catastrophes at best (Chapter \n1, ). Comparing the two- and 10-year time frames \nreveals a deteriorating global risks landscape. \nThirty-three of the 34 global risks increase in \nseverity score over the longer-term, reflecting \nrespondents\u2019 concerns about the heightened \nfrequency or intensity of these risks over the course \nof the 10-year horizon ().\nEnvironmental and technological risks are among \nthose expected to deteriorate the most in severity \nover this period and dominate the longer-term \nglobal risks landscape. Nearly all environmental \nrisks are included in the top 10 rankings for the \ndecade ahead (). Extreme weather \nevents are anticipated to become even more \nsevere, as the top ranked risk over the next decade. \nMirroring last year\u2019s results, the perceived severity \nof Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse \nworsens the most of all risks, increasing by a full \ntwo Likert points, rising from #20 in the short-term \nto 3rd place. Critical change to Earth systems \n(#2) and Natural resource shortages (#4) are also \namong those perceived to materially deteriorate, \ncontributing to their entrance into the top 10 ranking \nof risks over the next 10 years, while the related risk \nof Involuntary migration rises one place to #7 over \nthe next decade. Pollution remains in 10th place. In \ncontrast, Non-weather related natural disasters \n(#33) falls close to the bottom of rankings over both \ntime horizons, likely reflecting the nature of such a \ntail risk and the often geographically isolated nature \nof these events.  \nGlobal risks ranked by severity over the long term (10 years)\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks\nPerception Survey 2023-2024.\n\"Please estimate the likely impact (severity) of the following risks over a 10-year period.\"\n6th\n7th\n8th\n9th\n10th\nAdverse outcomes of AI technologies\nInvoluntary migration\nCyber insecurity\nSocietal polarization\nPollution\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\n4th\n5th\nExtreme weather events\nCritical change to Earth systems\nBiodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse\nNatural resource shortages\nMisinformation and disinformation\nRisk categories\nEconomic\nEnvironmental\nGeopolitical\nSocietal\nTechnological\nThese results highlight divergent perceptions \naround the comparative urgency of environmental \nrisks. Biodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse \n(#20 in the two-year time frame) and Critical \nchange to Earth systems (#11 in the two-year \ntime frame) feature in the longer-term rankings for \nall stakeholder groups (). However, it \nappears that younger respondents prioritize these \nrisks as a more urgent concern, ranking them \nhigher in the two-year period compared to other \nage groups (Chapter 1, ). Private-sector \nrespondents, unlike those from civil society or \ngovernment, feel that most environmental risks will \nmaterialize over a longer time frame (Figures 1.5 \nand 2.3). This dissonance in perceptions among \nkey decision-makers could mean the time to act \nmay soon pass, without sufficient progress made \n(Chapter 2.3: A 3\u00b0C world).\nConcerns around the possible implications of \nrecent technological developments are also clearly \nevident. Adverse outcomes of AI technologies \nis anticipated to experience one of the largest \ndeteriorations in severity. It rapidly rises from #29 \nover the two-year period to #6 over the 10-year \nperiod, likely reflecting the possible systemic \nor even existential nature of related risks as AI \npenetrates economic, social and political systems \n(Chapter 2.4: AI in charge). Despite worsening \nseverity scores over this time frame, the most \nprominent technological risks in the short term, \nMisinformation and disinformation and Cyber \ninsecurity, drop in ranking but remain in the \ntop 10 over the longer-term, at 5th and 8th \nplace, respectively. The related risk of Societal \npolarization also drops from 3rd place in the short \nterm to 9th place over the longer-term horizon.\nDespite a small increase in perceived severity, the \nsocietal risk of Lack of economic opportunity \nfalls from #6 over two years to #11 in the global \nrankings; however, it makes the top 10 rankings for \nboth civil society and academia respondents over \nthe longer-term horizon ().

The related economic risk of \nIllicit economic activity is perceived to be of lower \nseverity over both time periods. However, it is seen \nto be driven by several risks ranked in both the \nshort- and longer-term top 10, suggesting it may be \nan underappreciated risk over the coming decade \n(Chapter 2.6: Crime wave).\nInflation is the only risk with a severity score \npredicted to improve over the next decade, and \nit moves from #7 to #32. In fact, most economic \nrisks fall rapidly in comparative rankings of risk \nperception over the next decade, with, for example, \nEconomic downturn dropping from #9 to #28 \nover the longer-term horizon. This may reflect that \nGeoeconomic confrontation (#16), a key driver of \nmany of economic risks, has decreased significantly \nin perceived severity over both time horizons when \ncompared to last year\u2019s scores.1 \nIndeed, geopolitical risks are noticeably absent \nfrom the top 10 rankings over the next decade. \nInterstate armed conflict exhibits the same long-\nterm severity score as last year but falls from 5th \nto 15th place over the 10-year period. Similar to \nlast year, Terrorist attacks sits in the bottom left \nquadrant of , indicating lower perceived \nseverity over both the short and long term. While \nthe latest available data indicates that overall \nlethality remains contained compared to other risks, \nat 6,701 global fatalities in 2022, terrorism has the \npotential to spark broader conflict and unrest, such \nas the current conflict in the Middle East.2 Structural forces\n2.2\nAcross several spheres \u2013 geostrategic, \ntechnological, climatic and demographic \u2013 we are \ntransitioning to a new underlying set of conditions \nand parameters. These shifts form the backdrop \nto the global risks that will play out over the \nnext decade. This year, the Global Risks Report \nintroduces the concept of structural forces to \nour analysis of global risks over the next decade.3 \nWe define these as the long-term shift in the \narrangement of, and relation between, the \nsystemic elements of the global landscape. \nThese forces have the potential to materially impact \nthe speed, spread or scope of global risks, and will \nbe influenced in turn by each other.\nThere are four structural forces that are the most \nmaterially influential to the global risks landscape. \nThese are summarized in Box 2.14 and include: \ntechnological acceleration; geostrategic shifts; \nclimate change; and demographic bifurcation. While \nall four forces have global ramifications, some, such \nas the changing climate, are more multi-directional \nin their development, which could allow for several \npotential futures. Similarly, while all represent \nlonger-term shifts to the structural landscape, \nsome have the potential to manifest more quickly \ndue to underlying variables. Geostrategic shifts, for \nexample, may lead to a lack of alignment between \npowers, while technological acceleration can foster \nnew discoveries that transform systems rapidly.\nStructural forces\nB O X  2 . 1\nTechnological acceleration relates to development \npathways of emerging technologies.\nA subset of key technologies, including general-purpose \nAI, is anticipated to experience significant, accelerated \ndevelopment over the next 10 years. \nGiven the sheer scope of frontier development and \ngeneral-purpose applications, multiple trajectories \nmay arise. Quantum computing, for example, could \nallow compute power to leapfrog and, alongside \nanticipated benefits, rapidly give rise to novel global risks. \nTechnological experimentation, such as brain-computer \ninterfaces, could blur the boundaries between technology \nand humanity, to unknown effects.\nClimate change encompasses the range of possible \ntrajectories of global warming and consequences to \nEarth systems.\nClimate change is characterized as a systemic shift \nin this year\u2019s analysis because the threshold of 1.5\u00b0C \nabove pre-industrial temperatures, specified in the \n2015 Paris Agreement, is anticipated to be crossed by \nthe early to mid-2030s. \nHowever, global warming pathways will still be \ninfluenced by the speed at which decarbonization \ntakes place, and deployment of climate solutions.\nDegradation of environmental systems could also \naccelerate estimated trajectories, to the extent that \nthey \u201cnaturally\u201d contribute to global warming and \nrelated effects (such as the reversal of carbon sinks).\nGeostrategic shifts refers to evolving sources and \nconcentration of geopolitical power. \nThis, in turn, influences the alignment of the geopolitical \norder, impacting related alliances and dynamics, as well \nas the offensive and defensive projection of soft and \nhard power over the next decade. Economic power is \nbecoming more diffuse, for instance, reflecting changes \nin currency dependencies, sources of energy, available \ncapital and size of consumer markets. Concentrations \nof economic and military power are also highly related to \ntechnological and resource assets. \nWhile alternate futures are possible, an array of powers \nwill likely assert their dominance on the global stage in a \nmultipolar world. \nDemographic bifurcation refers to changes in the \nsize, growth and structure of populations around the \nworld.\nThe demographic divide is widening. Polarizing growth \nat the top and bottom end of population pyramids, \nand between countries and regions, will have material \nimplications for related socioeconomic and political \nsystems.\nAsia continues to dominate in terms of absolute \npopulation growth. Most countries will continue to \ngrapple with an ageing population, combining a long-\nterm rise in life expectancy with declining fertility rates. \nIn contrast, Africa faces a radically different policy \nchallenge: by 2030, young Africans are expected to \nconstitute 42% of global youth.\nSource \nWorld Economic Forum .\nNote \nRefer to Appendix A: Definitions and Global Risks List for \nfurther detail. As these structural forces interact, we consider four \nemerging global risks and how they may evolve \nover the next decade: \n\t\u2013\nEarth systems: all stakeholder groups agree \nthat Critical change to Earth systems (#2) \nposes one of the most severe risks faced over \nthe next decade.

Could closing \ndevelopmental pathways leave vulnerable \npopulations and countries, and the next \ngeneration, with little hope for a brighter future? \n\t\u2013\nOrganized crime: Illicit economic activity \n(#31) is one of the lowest-ranked risks in the \nglobal risks network, but the convergence of \nseveral top-ranked risks could turn an under-\nthe-radar chronic risk into a pressing crisis. Will \ntransnational crime networks subsume fragile \nstates and vulnerable populations, capitalizing \non highly disruptive technologies and weakened \nstate capacity?\nThe futures highlighted in each of the following \nsections is only one of a multiplicity of possibilities, \nand we highlight opportunities to shape a more \npositive path forward by acting today.\nElizabeth Lies, Unsplash A 3\u00b0C world\n2.3\n\t\u2013\nThresholds for large-scale and self-perpetuating changes to planetary systems are likely to be exceeded \nwithin the next decade.\n\t\u2013\nThe pace and scale of climate-change adaptation efforts are already falling short, with societies \nincreasingly exposed to environmental impacts to which they may be unable to adapt, fueling \ndisplacement and migration.\n\t\u2013\nNascent mitigation technologies, while attractive in some respects, could have unintended \nenvironmental and social consequences, with implications for legal liabilities, geopolitical dynamics and \nthe climate agenda. \nSeverity score: Critical change to Earth systems\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks\nPerception Survey 2023-2024.\n10-year rank: 2nd\nLong-term, potentially irreversible and self-perpetuating changes to critical planetary systems, as a result of breaching a critical threshold \nor \u2018tipping point\u2019, at a regional or global level, that have abrupt and severe impacts on planet health or human welfare.

While these changes \nemerge comparatively silently, with their effects \nbuilding over the long term, impacts are felt on \na systemic level, intensifying impacts to food, \nwater and health security. Yet as the need for \nclimate solutions become more urgent, the risk of \ntechnology-induced tipping points \u2013 such as from \ngeoengineering \u2013 will also grow.\nBreached thresholds\nIt remains challenging to define climate tipping \npoints and assess their likelihood. However, the \nlatest research increasingly suggests that long-term \nchanges to planetary systems will be triggered \nover the next decade, possibly without the world \nrealizing that the point of no return \u2013 the point of \nintervention - has passed. Importantly, most of the \nIPCC scenarios allow for temperature overshoot \n\u2013 however, the breaching of critical thresholds will \ntrigger long-lasting and fundamental changes,10 with \na fresh set of climate and environmental conditions \nthat could rewrite our collective understanding of \nthe risks posed by climate change. \nWhile recent research suggests that the trajectory \nof 1.5\u00b0C may be locked in regardless of action Examples of global and regional tipping points\n\nSource\nMcKay, et. al., 2022; OECD, 2022; Lenton, et. al., 2023. \nGreenland ice sheet\nCollapse\nBoreal permafrost\nCollapse\nBoreal forest\nSouthern dieback\nBoreal forest\nNorthern expansion\nAmazon rainforest\nDieback\nMountain glaciers\nLoss\nAtlantic Meridional\nOverturning Circulation\n(AMOC)\nCollapse\nSahel/West African\nmonsoon\nGreening\nLow-latitude\ncoral reefs\nDie-off\nWest Antarctic\nice sheet\nCollapse\nEast Antarctic\nice sheet\nCollapse\nEast Antarctic\nsubglacial basins\nCollapse\nLabrador sea/\nsubpolar gyre\nCollapse\nBoreal permafrost\nAbrupt thaw\nGlobal warming\nthresholds\n1.5\u00b0C\n>1.5-2\u00b0C\n>2-4\u00b0C\n>4\u00b0C\nCategory\nCryosphere entities\nCirculation patterns\nBiosphere components\ntaken today, estimates relating to climate tipping \npoints may be conservative or even optimistic.11 \nMost climate models, whether public, private \nor academic, do not adequately capture non-\nlinear impacts. For example, the transition of the \nAmazon into savannah will likely be caused by a \ncombination of climate and ecological impacts, \npossibly transitioning well before 3\u00b0C of warming \n(), due to land-use changes and \ndeforestation.12  Most models also fail to capture \nthe interconnectedness of these systems: how \ncould cascading effects from the passing of one \ntipping point lower the critical threshold for others? \nFor example, melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet \ncould lead to an influx of fresh water, destabilizing \nthe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation \n(AMOC) and creating conditions that melt the West \nAntarctic Ice Sheet faster.13\nEarly warning signs suggest that several systems, \nincluding the Greenland Ice Sheet, AMOC and \nAmazon rainforest, are losing resilience,14 and \nit is possible that some critical thresholds have \nalready been crossed.15 Indeed, not all tipping \npoints will be observed. Some will manifest as \ndistinct changes, such as an ocean heatwave that \nprecipitates the collapse of coral reefs. The \u201cedge\u201d \nof these thresholds can be sharp \u2013 for example, \nthe point at which the Greenland Ice Sheet reflects \nless heat than it absorbs. But not all tipping points \nwill be visible at the current level of modelling and \nmonitoring. The comparatively slow velocity of most \ncritical changes to Earth systems \u2013 time between \nthe tipping point and when impacts are fully felt \n\u2013 means that most will be silent, with impacts \ngradually building over the longer-term.\nAs such, climate tipping points are risks that are \nwell-known but not necessarily well-understood. \nGRPS results indicate that the impacts of climate \nchange are well-recognized by global decision-\nmakers. However, if critical changes to Earth \nsystems are seen as longer-term risks \u2013 with \nlikelihoods or impacts underestimated, or simply \ndismissed as too uncertain \u2013 intervention may come \ntoo late to prevent cascading planetary change, \nhindering our ability to fully adapt to related impacts. \nLimits to climate adaptation\nOver the next 10 years, many economies could \nremain largely unprepared for these non-linear \nimpacts of climate change. This is not the first time \nthat abrupt changes to our planetary system have The next global shock? \nB O X  2 . 2\nCollapse of the AMOC\nResearch suggests that the tipping point of \nthe Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation \n(AMOC) is \u201cpossible\u201d at 1.4\u00b0C, but only \u201clikely\u201d \nat 4.0\u00b0C.16 However, a profound shift at much \nlower temperatures cannot be ruled out.17 While \ntimescales and temperature thresholds are heavily \ndebated among the scientific community, there is \nsome evidence to suggest that the circulation of \nthis current is at its weakest point in over 1,000  \n \n \nyears, and may be closer than anticipated to a \ncritical transition.18 A collapse of this system would \nwholly reorganize ocean circulation, resulting in \nglobal and regional cooling, and a redistribution \nof heat, rainfall and sea ice. Sea levels and \nagricultural, marine and terrestrial systems \nwould be impacted, and global food security \ncompromised.19 \noccurred: tipping points in our planet\u2019s history have \nled to alternative stable states to which life has \nadapted over time.20 Rather, the risk is posed to \nsocioeconomic structures: is the alternate state one \nto which we as human societies can adapt? \nClimate tipping points could result in a socio-\nenvironmental crisis, intensifying current risks. \nGRPS respondents foresee a highly related cluster \nof environmental risks, with bilateral connections to \nCritical change to Earth systems. This includes \nBiodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse, \nExtreme weather events and Pollution, with \nstrong potential to lead to Natural resource \nshortages (). Alongside environmental \nimpacts, several GRPS respondents also highlight \npossible socioeconomic implications, including \nInvoluntary migration, Chronic health conditions, \nInfectious diseases and Economic downturn. \nIndeed, as explored in last year\u2019s Global Risks \nReport (Chapter 2.2: Natural ecosystems), this \nnexus of socioenvironmental risks have the potential \nto accelerate climate change, through the release of \nemissions, and amplify related impacts, threatening \nclimate-vulnerable populations.\nThe collective ability to adapt to these impacts may \nbe overwhelmed by several factors. \nClimate tipping points\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks \nPerception Survey 2023-2024.\nEdges\nRelative in\ufb02uence\nHigh\nLow\nMedium\nRisk in\ufb02uence\nNodes\nHigh\nLow\nMedium\nRisk categories\nEconomic\nEnvironmental\nGeopolitical\nSocietal\nTechnological\nReference\nRisk interconnections: Critical change to Earth systems\nInfectious diseases\nInvoluntary migration\nPollution\nBiodiversity loss and\necosystem collapse\nCritical change to\nEarth systems\nExtreme\nweather events\nChronic health conditions\nNatural resource shortages\nEconomic downturn First, adaptation efforts are unlikely to radically \nprogress over the next decade, particularly in \nthe most climate-vulnerable economies.

This likely reflects far more \npressing challenges, including state fragility, poverty \nand conflict \u2013 such as in Yemen and the Democratic \nRepublic of the Congo \u2013 but could hinder climate-\nadaptive action from being undertaken, in advance \nof these impacts intensifying further.\nIndeed, adaptation efforts in developing countries \ncould be constrained by finances, paired with the \nsheer scope of infrastructure investment needs over \nthe next decade ().23 As the fragility of \nhighly-exposed, low-resilience states rises, internal \nconflicts and border clashes over resources could \nbecome more common (Chapter 1.4: Rise in \nconflict),24 and many countries could increasingly \nbe seen as too high risk to operate or invest in \n(Chapter 2.5: End of development?), eroding \nadaptive capacities further. Related socioeconomic \ntipping points \u2013 such as land abandonment or the \nexit of investment and insurance in high-risk regions \n\u2013 could therefore occur even before planetary tipping \npoints are demonstrably breached.25 Advanced \neconomies will not be insulated from some of these \neffects. For example, in Australia nearly 521,000 \nhomes are predicted to be uninsurable by 2030 due \nto the risks of extreme weather.26\n\u201cWhich \ufb01ve risks are the most likely to pose the biggest threat to your country in the next two years?\u201d\n1st\n10th\n20th\n30th\n36th\nRisk ranking\nKyrgyzstan\nArmenia\nKazakhstan\nMongolia\nSouth Korea\nJapan\nNew Zealand\nBahamas\nSweden\nItaly\nGermany\nPeru\nEcuador\nBrazil\nPoland\nUkraine\nBulgaria Estonia\nSwitzerland\nLuxembourg\nHonduras\nColombia\nEl Salvador Venezuela\nBolivia\nCanada\nUnited States\nYemen\nIndia\nLesotho\nUnited Republic of Tanzania\nChad\nSierra Leone\nKenya\nZimbabwe\nNigeria\nMali\nMalawi\nPakistan\nNepal\nBangladesh\nThailand\nIndonesia\nIraq\nEgypt\nAlgeria\nParaguay\nSenegal\nRwanda\nViet Nam\nPhilippines\nGhana\nCameroon\nBenin\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\nAngola\nLao PDR\nAustralia\nGeorgia\nUzbekistan\nCentral Asia\nEastern Asia\nEurope\nLatin America and\nthe Caribbean\nMiddle East and\nNorthern Africa\nNorthern America\nOceania\nSouth-eastern Asia\nSouthern Asia\nSub-Saharan Africa\nLao PDR\n0\nLow\nHigh\n50\n25\n75\n100\nGlobal adaption score\nTop 10\nAdaptation readiness\n\nSource\nND-Gain Country Index; World Economic Forum\nExecutive Opinion Survey 2023.\nNote\nThe colour of the data points re\ufb02ects the ND-GAIN Country Index (2021), which summarizes a \ncountry\u2019s vulnerability to climate change and other global challenges in combination with its \nreadiness to improve resilience.

In addition, long lead times for developing \nappropriate infrastructure may challenge readiness \nfor regional or local changes that manifest abruptly. \nFor example, the collapse of coral reef systems \n\u2013 which absorb more than 90% of wave energy \n\u2013 could leave coastal communities vulnerable to \nstorm surges, potentially doubling annual flood \ndamage on a global scale.27 Extreme weather, a \nparallel phenomenon occurring alongside planetary \nchanges, is mutually reinforcing: the former can \npush a planetary system into an alternative state \n(for example a heatwave collapsing coral systems), \nwhile many of the climate tipping points are \nanticipated to shift weather patterns and increase \nextreme weather in turn, creating positive feedback \nloops of greenhouse gas emissions.28 \nTogether, these environmental and planetary \nchanges could radically impact economic growth \nand insurability over the next decade,29 driving food, \nwater and health insecurity. Immediate impacts \ncould reduce agricultural productivity and potentially \ncause simultaneous harvest failures in key regions. \nFor example, some studies suggest that the loss of \nsignificant ice mass from the Greenland Ice Sheet \ncould lead to droughts and agricultural loss in the \nSahel region, in northern Africa, at the same time as \nit reduces marine primary productivity in the North \nAtlantic.30 Although specific geographic impacts \nare highly complex due to the influence of multiple \nplanetary systems, food and water insecurity \nare a key source of exposure \u2013 or leverage \u2013 for \nseveral global and regional powers. China, South \nKorea, Japan, Russia and Saudi Arabia are among \nthe largest net importers of food and agricultural \nproducts, whereas Argentina, Australia, Brazil, \nCanada, New Zealand, Thailand and the United \nStates comprise some of the largest exporters.31 \nAt a domestic level, intensifying competition for \nresources could spark disputes over dwindling \nfreshwater sources, arable land and habitable \nareas. On the international stage, changes to \nagricultural productivity and water availability \ncould alter global trade patterns and alliances, or \neven become a bargaining chip in the contentious \nmanagement of migration flows between host \ncountries, adding an additional layer of complexity \nto shifting geostrategic dynamics. \nThere are also clear limits to adaptation, and \ntipping points will induce changes that, although \nlonger-term in nature, are likely to overwhelm even \nwell-implemented adaptation solutions and make \nrelocation and migration more likely.32 For example, \nthe Thwaites Glacier, currently held in place by \nthe West Antarctic Ice Sheet, could slide into the \nocean within the next 10 years.33 Although research \nis evolving and impact time frames are highly \nuncertain, this could cause a sea level rise of more \nthan half a metre, or, through the destabilization of \nthe West Antarctic Ice Sheet, up to 3.2 metres over \nlonger timescales according to some estimates,34 \ndramatically altering coastlines and submerging \nsome island states ().35\nModelled costs\nof adaptation\nUS$125 billion/year\nthis decade\nThe adaptation \ufb01nance\ngap is estimated at\nUS$194 to US$366\nbillion/year (based on 2021\nadaptation \ufb01nance \ufb02ows)\nAdaptation\n\ufb01nancing needs\nUS$387 billion/year\nup to 2030\nInternational\npublic \ufb01nance \ufb02ows\nUS$21 billion\nin 2021\n200\n300\n400\n100\n0\nUS$ billion/year for developing countries\nAdaptation \ufb01nance gap\n\nSource\nUN Adaptation Gap Report, 2023.

Some directly remove \ncarbon dioxide from the atmosphere (for example, \nthrough direct air capture and carbon storage), \nwhile others intervene to cool the climate, such as \nsolar radiation management (SRM).41 Investment in \ncarbon capture and storage has already doubled \nto hit a record high of $6.4 billion in 2023, and \nthe United States has already granted $1.2 billion \nin long-term funding to two Direct Air Capture \nhub developments in the states of Texas and \nLouisiana42 \u2013 a bipartisan move that could survive \nthe outcomes of the 2024 elections. \nDeployment of geoengineering technologies is \nnuanced, posing global benefits but also presenting \nsystem-wide and localized risks. First, a growing \nfocus on \u201cabated\u201d emissions (fossil fuel emissions \ncaught through technologies) could shift capital \nand focus away from emissions reduction and \nadaptation. This complacency could take hold \nbefore carbon removal is able to sufficiently scale \nover the next decade, given significant infrastructure \nand investment requirements, resulting in an overall \nslowdown in climate mitigation at a critical time.\nSecond, dependent on the specific frontier \ntechnology in question, consequences are unknown \nor highly uncertain. Deployment could possibly lead \nto unintended changes to, for example, regional \nprecipitation.43 In addition, geological storage \nof carbon risks future \u201cventing\u201d, with potentially \nharmful consequences for nearby communities.44 \nSRM could reduce the frequency and intensity of \ntemperature extremes, but involves significant risks, \nlike sudden termination shocks and large-scale salt \nand acid deposition.45\nAs the impacts of climate change become \nincreasingly evident, these externalities could \ncomplicate existing questions around legal \naccountability for climate change. The loss and \ndamage agenda, as well as climate-related \nlitigation, is likely to gain speed, targeting local, \nstate and national governments.46 However, \ndeployment of these technologies by select actors \ncould challenge these legal avenues, simultaneously \ngiving rise to additional liabilities. For example, \neconomic damage, agricultural losses or health \nproblems from shifting weather patterns, acid \nrain, changes to air quality, or the spread of \ncommunicable diseases is possible under both \nclimate change and an \u201cengineered\u201d climate47 \u2013 \nand modelled attribution could be challenging if \nboth effects are in play. In some cases, engineered \neffects may exceed anticipated local impacts from \nclimate change, leading to geopolitical tensions and \npossibly even cross-border conflict.48\nThe next global shock?\nB O X  2 . 3\nAncient pandemic\nThe Arctic is the fastest warming region on Earth, \nexperiencing global warming levels that are more \nthan double those of the global average.36 Further \nwarming will lead to gradual reductions in the \npermafrost, while abrupt thawing could occur due \nto heatwaves, wildfires and other environmental \nshifts.37 Although an \u201cimprobable\u201d tail risk, it does \nnot require the full collapse of the permafrost \n \n \nto release harmful contaminants and ancient \n\u201cnew\u201d diseases, both microbial and virus-related, \nto which humans have little natural resistance, \nwithin the next decade.38 Further, as both states \nand animals exploit the warming of the Arctic \nregion, hosts will become more readily available, \nincreasing the likelihood of the biological threat.39 \nIvan Bandura, Unsplash Acting today\nAddressing the risk of critical changes to Earth \nsystems requires an evolved approach to climate \nrisk management and decision-making. While \nclimate models are effective at illustrating potential \nhazards, vulnerabilities and exposures for decision-\nmakers,51 the current limitations of these tools \nmeans that we are still entering unchartered \nterritory. Climate and economic modelling could \nbe improved to fully consider the longer-term, \nnon-linear and cascading impacts of Earth system \nchanges through more powerful tools for analysing \nthe Earth as an integrated whole, combining climate \nand ecological tipping points with broader planetary \nboundaries.52 Part of these efforts will require the \ntranslation of scientific findings to inform decision-\nmaking, which has proved difficult in a climate \ncontext, but may be even more challenging when \noverlaid with the nature context.\nIndeed, around one-half of GRPS respondents \nhighlight the need for enhanced Research and \ndevelopment with respect to both Critical \nchanges to Earth systems, but also Adverse \noutcomes of frontier technologies, including \ngeoengineering (). These efforts could \nbe supported through the creation of a global data \ncommons for climate science alongside further \ninvestment in relevant equipment (such as remote \nsensing equipment and computing power) and \necological forecasting. \nGRPS respondents feel that Global treaties and \nagreements have the most potential for driving \naction. More credible emissions reductions remain \nthe fastest and most effective means to avoid or \nmitigate the likelihood of climate tipping points. \nHowever, with evidence suggesting that some of \nthese tipping points are already locked in, the ratio \nof adaptation to mitigation efforts will need to be \nrebalanced through National and local regulation, \nas complementary objectives. Expanding access \nto existing adaptation solutions will be essential, \nincluding early-warning systems, and decentralized \nrenewable energy (disconnected from the grid) \nto empower local communities. States and \ndevelopment banks will need to work closely \ntogether to de-risk investment for the private sector \nin priority areas and markets.\nThe next global shock?\nB O X  2 . 4\nUngoverned deployment\nDeliberate climate manipulation may form the next \n\u201cManhattan Project\u201d, as governments become \nmore selective about climate-related technologies \nthat can be scaled and delivered in policy-relevant \ntime frames.49 Although highly unlikely, the \nunilateral and ungoverned deployment of climate \nmanipulation technology is possible within the next \n \n \n10 years, including by a single country, non-state \nactors such as philanthropists, or by companies \nfor commercial gain.50 While some technologies \nonly have temporary effects, there is a great deal \nof uncertainty around impacts even over a short-\nterm time frame. \nRisk governance: A 3\u00b0C world\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks\nPerception Survey 2023-2024.\n\u201cWhich approach(es) do you expect to have the most potential for driving action on risk reduction and preparedness over the next 10 \nyears?

Alongside \nproductivity benefits and breakthroughs in fields \nas diverse as healthcare, education and climate \nchange, advanced AI carries major societal risks. \nIt will also interact with parallel advancements in \nother technologies, from quantum computing to \nsynthetic biology, amplifying adverse consequences \nposed by these frontier developments (Boxes 2.5 \nand 2.7). Intentional misuse is not required for the \nimplications to be profound. Novel risks will arise \nfrom self-improving generative AI models that are \nhanded increasing control over the physical world, \ntriggering large-scale changes to socioeconomic \nstructures.53\nAdverse outcomes of AI technologies is another \nnew entrant to the top 10 rankings, deteriorating \nsignificantly in perceived risk severity over the \nlonger-term horizon (). Alongside the \npossibility of an entity achieving artificial general \nintelligence (AGI) \u2013 learning to accomplish any \nhuman or animal task \u2013 key concerns cited by \nGRPS respondents include: misinformation and \ndisinformation (Chapter 1.3: False information); \njob loss and displacement (Chapter 2.5: \nEnd of development?); criminal use and \ncyberattacks (Chapter 2.6: Crime wave); bias and \ndiscrimination; use in critical decision-making by \nboth organizations and states; and AI\u2019s integration \ninto weaponry and warfare. \nTo date, the precautionary principle (prudence in \nthe face of uncertainty) has largely not been applied \nin the development of AI, as regulators erred on \nthe side of innovation. However, rapidly evolving \ndevelopment of and reliance on advanced machine \nintelligence is outpacing our ability to adapt \u2013 both \nto understand the technology itself (the \u201cBlack Box \nProblem\u201d) and to create regulatory safeguards (the \n\u201cPacing Problem\u201d), with regulation playing catch \nup to the technology.54 The speed of advances, \ndepth of market power and strategic importance of \nthe industry will continue to challenge the appetite \nand regulatory capacity of governance institutions. \nDownstream risks could endanger political systems, \neconomic markets and global security and stability. Entrenched market concentration\nPrivate sector-led development of a powerful dual-\nuse (both civilian and military) technology makes \nregulatory guardrails even more essential. However, \ncommercial incentives and national security-driven \n\u201ctech wars\u201d may outstrip regulatory efforts to curb \nadverse societal and security outcomes.\nGRPS respondents highlight Cyber insecurity \nand Technological power concentration as \nthe only risk drivers of Adverse outcomes of AI \ntechnologies (). The production of AI \ntechnologies is highly concentrated, in a singular, \nglobally integrated supply chain that favors a few \ncompanies and countries ().55 This \ncreates significant supply-chain risks that may \nunfold over the coming decade. For example, \nexport controls over early stages of the supply \nchain (including minerals), could raise overall \ncosts and lead to persistent inflationary pressures. \nRestricted access to more complex inputs (such as \nsemiconductors) could radically alter the trajectory \nof advanced technological deployment within a \ncountry. The extensive deployment of a small set \nof AI foundation models,56 including in finance \nand the public sector, or overreliance on a single \ncloud provider, could give rise to systemic cyber \nvulnerabilities, paralyzing critical infrastructure.\nGiven the strategic significance of AI technologies, \nnational security objectives will likely remain the \nprimary objective of innovation and industrial \npolicy in several economies in response to market \nconcentration, shaping upstream market dynamics \n(). States will aim for securing their \nsupply chains, onshoring and friend-shoring \nwhere possible. For example, China is pursuing \na largely independent supply chain, given export \ncontrols that block access to the most advanced \nsemiconductor chips.57 Some states may seek to \ncapture lucrative economic gains associated with \nthese technologies, while others will aim to address \nconcentration, potentially at the price of innovation. \nBuilding on a history of tackling anti-competitive \npractices in the tech sector,58  the EU plans to \ndeploy new mechanisms to disrupt the dominance \nof digital \u201cgatekeepers\u201d and is also reportedly \nconsidering an investigation into anti-competitive \npractices in graphics processing unit (GPU) chips.59\nTechnological power\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks \nPerception Survey 2023-2024. \nEdges\nRelative in\ufb02uence\nHigh\nLow\nMedium\nRisk in\ufb02uence\nNodes\nHigh\nLow\nMedium\nRisk categories\nEconomic\nEnvironmental\nGeopolitical\nSocietal\nTechnological\nReference\nRisk interconnections: Adverse consequences of AI technologies and Technological power concentration\nCensorship and surveillance\nAdverse outcomes of\nfrontier technologies\nCyber insecurity\nAdverse outcomes\nof AI technologies\nTechnological power\nconcentration\nMisinformation and disinformation\nErosion of human rights\nSocietal\npolarization\nLack of economic opportunity National security as a driver of industrial policy\n28 economies\nranked \u201cEnsure national security\u201d as the top objective currently orienting policy.

For example, \nthe use of a licensing regime could embed the \npower of existing players, even as it enhances \noversight of frontier AI.62 As governments seek to \nmanage the higher risk applications, widespread \ndependence on the underlying tech stack (the \ntechnologies used to develop an application) will \nlikely lend tech leaders a disproportionate influence \non legislative discourse, shaping industry norms and \nstandards over the next decade. While downstream \napplications are far more competitive, upstream \ncommercial motives \u2013 rather than public interest \u2013 \ncould become the guiding force of AI development \nand deployment. This trade-off can already be seen \nin the distinct lack of consistent self-regulation by \nthe industry, with responsible AI teams among the \nfirst to be subject to redundancies as the sector \ndownsized in recent years.63 Tech companies could \nbe left largely in charge of prices as well as privacy, \nand they may hold excessive sway over preventing \ncompetitive innovation. \nIf monopoly- or oligopoly-led profit maximization is \nthe primary objective of AI deployment over the next \ndecade, the consequences for applications across \nhealthcare, education, military, legal and financial \nsectors will be vast. In healthcare, for example, as \nthe volume and granularity of health data increases \nexponentially, the commercialization of related \ndata pools for downstream AI applications could \ncompromise individual privacy and erode trust \nin healthcare systems. In the absence of strong \nethical guardrails, medical data obtained from a \nfitness tracker, for instance, could individualize \nadvertising, facilitate discriminatory profiling for \nhealth insurance, or underpin new, more invasive \nforms of employee monitoring. Even as data \naccess enables new healthcare solutions and early \ndiagnosis, medical research and development could \nbe geared towards the wealthy \u2013 those who have \nthe resources to afford this type of pervasive daily \ndata collection and monitoring that is then used \nto train AI for various applications. Additionally, \nthe influence of upstream companies could \nmean that accountability for related risks, from \nbiased algorithms to diagnostic errors, is pushed \ndownstream in some jurisdictions, particularly in \ncountries with more limited market power, in return \nfor access to these technologies.\nThe next global shock?\nB O X  2 . 5\nBreakthrough in quantum computing\nQuantum computing could break and remake \nmonopolies over compute power, posing radical \nrisks in its development.64 Criminal actors have \nalready launched harvest attacks (also known \nas \u201cStore Now, Decrypt Later\u201d, or SNDL) in \nanticipation of a cryptographically significant \ncomputer. Trade secrets across multiple industries, \nincluding pharmaceuticals and technological \nhardware, could be compromised, alongside \ncritically sensitive data such as electronic health \n \n \nrecords and sold to the highest bidder.65 Large or \neven global infrastructure \u2013 such as banks, power \ngrids and hospitals \u2013 could also be paralyzed. Yet \nit is not just widespread proliferation of this level \nof compute power that is concerning. Although \narguably a tail risk,66 if cryptographically-significant \nquantum computing capability is covertly achieved \nand subsequently uncovered, it may rapidly \ndestabilize global security dynamics. \nMohammad Rahmani, Unsplash AI winners and losers\nIndeed, extensive integration of AI technologies \nmay create a new set of winners and losers \nacross advanced and developing economies alike. \nThe digital gap between high- and low- income \ncountries is likely to lead to stark disparities in \nthe societal impact \u2013 both benefits and risks \u2013 of \nAI technologies. The most vulnerable countries \nand communities in advanced and developing \neconomies could be left further behind, digitally \nisolated from turbocharged AI breakthroughs \nin economic productivity, finance, climate, \neducation and healthcare (Chapter 2.5: End of \ndevelopment?). Dominance of the Global North in \ntech stack development could perpetuate social, \ncultural and political biases, while resilience to \nrisks posed by AI, from mis- and disinformation to \ncriminal use, may also be lower in the Global South. \nTech talent \u2013 and therefore the deep understanding \nof these technologies \u2013 is concentrated in limited \nmarkets, with the resulting knowledge gap making \neffective regulation challenging. Across countries, \nAI tools could be licensed or repurposed as tools \nof repression, where relevant norms or regulations \nare nascent or non-existent (Chapter 1.3: False \ninformation).67 Imbalances in military capabilities \ncould also be entrenched, with related applications \nraising significant ethical and human rights \nconcerns around accountability.\nAs such, access to the tech stack will become \nan even more critical component of soft power \nfor rival states to cement their influence. The \nself-reinforcing nature of AI development is such \nthat producers of these technologies will only \nbecome more firmly established as AI is utilized to \nachieve the next technological breakthrough (or \nthe \u201crich-get-richer\u201d effect).68 However, a widening \narray of pivotal powers could leverage their own \ncompetitive advantages in the highly concentrated \nvalue chain to obtain access to these technologies \non more favorable terms, leading to novel power \ndynamics. This could range from suppliers of \ncritical minerals, including Australia, Canada, \nIndonesia, Morocco, Viet Nam and Chile, to those \nthat could leverage IP, such as Japan and South \nKorea, or capital, like Norway and Singapore. \nFurther, a handful of states, such as India, may \nsoon have the scale and economic might to \ndisrupt technology development directly, with new \ninnovations capturing market share or key stages \nof the value-added supply chain.69\nThe next global shock?\nB O X  2 . 6\nThe unelected billionaire\nTechnological power in the hands of the unelected \nis seen by numerous GRPS respondents to be \na bigger concern than power concentrated in \ngovernment. The influence of Big Tech companies \nis already transnational, competing with the likes \nof nation states,70 and generative AI will continue \nto catalyse the power of these companies and \nassociated founders. Although the influence of \n \n \nthese companies is predominantly exercised in \nthe regulatory sphere for now, control over dual-\nuse, general purpose technologies will continue \nto confer significant and direct power to private \nactors. The risk of unilateral action by individuals \ncould rise in a variety of new domains with \nsignificant consequences \u2013 such as the use of \ncivilian satellites in the war in Ukraine.71 \nMichael Dziedzic, \nUnsplash AI escalation\nThe application of AI technologies to military \nobjectives could threaten global stability over \nthe next decade, with the integration of machine \nintelligence into conflict decision-making posing a \nsevere risk.72\nAI will boost cyber warfare capabilities, enabling \nentire offensive and defensive systems that could \nact autonomously, with unpredictable impacts \nto networks and connected infrastructure. When \nit comes to kinetic warfare, global and regional \npowers have invested heavily in developing \nAI-driven weapons systems, and the degree of \nautonomy afforded to these is increasing: land, air \nand sea-based weapons can already undertake \nsurveillance without human input.73 Attempts have \nbeen made to establish international governance \naround their use; however, agreements have yet \nto be established.74 Abstentions and votes against \na draft UN resolution relating to autonomous \nweapons systems last year were notable, including \nChina, North Korea, Iran, Israel, T\u00fcrkiye, United \nArab Emirates, India and Russia.75 There remains \na material chance, therefore, that these systems \ncould be empowered to autonomously take \ndecisions on lethal actions, including goal creation \nand the selection of targets.76 The potential for \nmiscalculation in these scenarios is high.77 For \nexample, AI could misinterpret the \u201cunwritten\u201d \nnorms of geopolitical posturing, such as flying \nfighter jets close to airspace or military assets of \nrival powers, as a material threat, initiating conflict. \nThe most severe risk lies in AI applications to \nnuclear weapons. While governments have \nindicated that human control will be maintained over \nnuclear weapon systems, in principle AI may offer \nthe greatest defense by condensing decision time: \nmaking decisions at silicon, not biological speed.78 \nAt the same time, AI-enabled launch systems \ncould erode strategic stability, given its theoretical \npotential to target nuclear assets and second strike \ncapability, combined with the near impossible \ndetection of its development by rival states.79 \nIf states incorporate AI into nuclear weaponry, this \nwould significantly raise the risk of accidental or \nintentional escalation over the next decade, with \npotentially existential consequences.\nIn contrast to the upstream tech stack, the \ndownstream application of AI is a more competitive \nmarket. Despite being among the most powerful \nof emerging dual-use technologies, the economic \nand technical barriers to accessing frontier AI \nare significantly lower than for its technological \ncounterparts, such as geoengineering and quantum \ncomputing. Many GRPS respondents highlight \nconcerns around sudden and widespread access \nto generative AI applications, given that access \nto the internet effectively equates to access to \nthese models. Malicious actors can leverage a \nsuperhuman breadth of knowledge to conceptualize \nand proliferate dangerous capabilities, from \nmisinformation and malware to biological weapons \n(Box 2.7), threatening human rights and safety in a \nmyriad of ways.\nAlessio Soggetti, \nUnsplash\nThe next global shock?\nB O X  2 . 7\nNovel bioweapons\nThe attempted use of biochemical weapons by \nnon-state actors has historically been limited, \nprimarily due to high knowledge barriers.80 \nWithout regulation limiting open access to the \nmost powerful applications of AI technologies, a \ncombination of AI tools could enable the creation \nof more targeted and severe biological weapons \nby a wide spectrum of non-technical actors. Large \nlanguage models could provide information on \ndual-use topics, laboratory assistance and, \n \n \neventually, autonomous research, while biological \ndesign tools could allow the creation of new \nproteins and biological agents that overcome the \ntrade-off between transmissibility and virulence \nof pathogens.81 Impacts could be devastating, \nwith pathogens potentially used to disable military \npersonnel before a conflict, mimic a widespread \nglobal pandemic or even lethally target specific \nethnicities. Acting today\nGRPS respondents identify Public awareness and \neducation as one of the most effective mechanisms \nto address risk preparedness and reduction of \nAdverse outcomes of AI technologies (Figure \n2.15) and as a key tool to manage local impacts \nas well as build governance capacity and societal \nresilience. Literacy in generative AI is essential, for \nregulators and for broader society. AI literacy could \nbe integrated into public education systems and \ntrainings for journalists and decision-makers to not \nonly understand capabilities of AI systems but also \nto identify trustworthy sources of information. \nGRPS respondents also highlight the need for \nNational and local regulations. While national-\nlevel efforts will not necessarily prevent the rapid \nglobal proliferation of AI and related risks, robust \nbut flexible standard-setting can help ensure that \ntechnological development and deployment are \naligned with societal needs. The application of \nexisting legislation around intellectual property, \nemployment, competition policy, data protection, \nprivacy, and human rights will need to evolve to \naddress new challenges posed by generative AI.82 \nOther key areas anticipated to be addressed by \nvarious regulatory regimes over the short term \ninclude the identification of AI-generated products, \nblocks or limitations to the riskiest uses, and \ndetermination of liability for AI-induced harms.83 \nSolutions proposed include but are not limited to: \nregistration and licensing of the most powerful \nversions of the technology, tiering access to \ncomputing power, implementation of provenance \nand/or watermarking systems, Know-Your-\nCustomer procedures and mandatory incident \ndisclosures, and creating a robust auditing and \ncertification system.84 \nGRPS respondents also note the role of Global \ntreaties and agreements in the management of \nboth Adverse outcomes of AI technologies and \nTechnological power concentration. Several AI \ngovernance frameworks have already emerged at \na global level to provide high level guidance for AI \ndevelopment, including the latest G7 Hiroshima \nProcess on Generative Artificial Intelligence, as well \nas the Bletchley Declaration. In addition, there have \nalready been calls for an \u201cAI version\u201d of the IPCC.85 \nThis entity could, in collaboration with the private \nsector, enable global scientific consensus around the \nrisks and opportunities posed by frontier AI. Similarly, \nit could communicate findings to decision-makers, \nbased on best available projections of global AI \nhardware and software, albeit with faster assessment \ncycles by necessity. Oversight could also extend to a \nreporting database and registry of crucial AI systems. \nHowever, the most existential of these risks will require \nextensive cooperation between powers, to achieve \nmutual restraint around the proliferation of high-impact \ntechnologies, as well as the inadvertent escalation in \nmilitary AI (Chapter 3: Responding to global risks).\nRisk governance: AI in charge\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks\nPerception Survey 2023-2024.\n\u201cWhich approach(es) do you expect to have the most potential for driving action on risk reduction and preparedness over the next 10 \nyears?

It features in the top 10 risks \nlist over the two-year horizon and is expected to \nworsen in perceived severity over the longer term \n(). Alongside Unemployment as the \nprimary driver, GRPS respondents consider a Lack \nof economic opportunity to stem from a complex \nmix of other global risks. This includes short-term \neconomic risks, such as Economic downturn \nand Inflation, and pressing societal risks such as \nErosion of human rights, Intrastate violence and \nSocietal polarization ().\nWithout careful management of the large-scale \neconomic transformations that are taking place, \neconomic mobility will stall and reverse. The climate \ntransition, advances in AI, demographic shifts \nand geopolitical dynamics could interact over the \ncoming decade to cement the mismatch between \nthe demand and supply of labour between and \nwithin countries. The consequences for societal \ncohesion and political outcomes are wide-reaching, \nthreatening standards of living for a large segment \nof the population in many economies. \nGene Butty, Unsplash 1990\n1995\n2000\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2021\nWorld\nHuman Development Index score (0-1)\nYear\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n1.0\n0.7\n0.8\n0.9\nEthnic violence\nin Burundi\nFirst multi-party\nelections in Malawi\nsince 1964 \nInvasion\nof Iraq\nHurricane\nin Honduras\nSudan begins\nto export oil\nCyclone Nargis\nin Myanmar\nEarthquake\nin Haiti\nEnd of the\nIrish Troubles\nSyrian\ncivil war\nHurricane Maria\nhits Dominica\nCovid-19\npandemic\nIcelandic\nbanking collapse\nSource\nUNDP, 2023.\nHuman Development Index scores, selected economies, 1990-2020\n\nRisk categories\nEconomic\nEnvironmental\nGeopolitical\nSocietal\nTechnological Bifurcated markets\nDisruptions to labour markets are likely to escalate \nworldwide as a result of the two large-scale \neconomic transformations that are concurrently \ntaking place, driven by climate action and AI \nintegration. These twin transitions will dramatically \nreshape the quality, quantity and distribution of \njob creation as well as job loss, driving divergent \nrisks. Some economies and communities, isolated \nfrom job-creation and reskilling opportunities, \nwill encounter saturated labour markets, \nhindering development. In others, challenges to \nsocial and labour mobility could contribute to \nshortages in critical industries, slowing economic \ntransformations and progress. \nBoth transitions offer valuable opportunities to \ntackle economic inequality through the generation \nof new income opportunities across a range of \nsectors. For example, AI and Machine Learning \nSpecialists is anticipated to be the fastest-growing \njob, growing by 40% (1 million jobs) by 2027, while \nthe green transition is estimated to lead to more \nthan 30 million jobs by 2030.87 Mirroring demand \nfor renewable infrastructure, the global construction \nsector is expected to double in size in the 10-year \nperiod from 2020 to 2030, while related jobs, \nincluding those in trades and engineering, are \namong those anticipated to experience the largest \ngrowth in the coming years ().88\nHowever, related job churn is likely to be significant, \nas these transitions displace workers in parallel, \npotentially leading to net job loss overall.

Inflows of public and private \ncapital to accelerate the energy transition have been \nparticularly pronounced in the United States, China \nand the EU, due to more sophisticated financing \nmechanisms and policy incentives.90 \nIn contrast, relatively less stable, lower-income, \nconflict-prone or climate-vulnerable developing \neconomies may be seen as too high-risk for \ninvestment or operations. With many already \nholding sub-investment-grade credit ratings, private \ninterest could dry up further, given heightened \npolitical, regulatory, societal and economic \ninstability, as well as the adverse effects of climate \nchange.91 Indeed, experts consulted worry that \neven published estimations of climate-related \nmigration could drive capital elsewhere (Chapter \n2.3: A 3\u00b0C world). This would exacerbate existing \nchallenges in terms of public and development \nfinancing.92 Many of the Least Developed Countries \n(LDCs), grappling with debt distress, already face large financing gaps in reaching development goals \nin the medium term () \u2013 and geopolitical \ninstability could further hinder international financial \nefforts to support these economies, from debt \nrestructuring to foreign aid (Box 2.8).\nThis global gap between job-creating investments \nand willing workforces will therefore lead to \ndivergent risks in the demand and supply of \nlabour. The demographic dividend of some \ndeveloping markets may quickly turn into a \ndemographic dilemma in which unemployment \nbecomes a chronic risk. In the absence of \nsubstantive domestic or foreign investment, some \neconomies may be unable to generate sufficient \ngreen- and tech-related income opportunities to \nabsorb a growing workforce, while other sectors \nalso could become at risk in a low growth, high-\nrate, low-investment world. This is a challenge \nthat will not be limited to the LDCs \u2013 select \nmiddle-income economies that have sought \ngrowth through an export-led model may also \nface substantial job erosion.93 Mirroring trends \nin manufacturing, several countries have relied \non rapid growth in digitally delivered services \nexports (),94 yet the industries and job \nfunctions most impacted by generative AI are \namong those most commonly outsourced and \noffshored, such as information technology, finance \nand human resources.95 Although higher-value \nincome opportunities will be created through \nAI augmentation, these jobs are likely to be \nDollars per capita\n0\n750\n1000\n1250\n1500\n1750\n500\n250\nFunding gaps in the Least Developed Countries\n\nSource\nUNCTAD, 2023.\nNote\nAs of 31 August 2023, six Least Developed Countries (LDCs) were in debt distress and 15 were \nat high risk of debt distress.\nFinancing need\nProjected spending\nProjected spending in 2025 on Sustainable Development Goals and \ufb01nancing needs to reach those goals by 2030, dollars per capita\nBenin\nBangladesh\nAngola\nBhutan\nBurkina Faso\nBurundi\nCambodia\nCentral African Republic\nChad\nComoros\nCongo, Dem.

The \nlower cost of labour may still incentivize offshoring \nto a degree; however, protectionism in digital \nservices could strengthen. For example, stronger \ndata localization requirements would effectively \n\u201creshore\u201d these industries.96 As such, a more \nfundamental question is rapidly emerging: can \nmanufacturing- and services-led export growth \nremain an accessible pathway to greater prosperity \nfor developing countries?\nIn most advanced economies, the creation of \n\u201cboots-on-the-ground\u201d green infrastructure jobs \ncould exacerbate already tight labour markets.97 This \ncould be a severe constraint to the green transition \nfor the largest emitters in the medium term and, given \ngeopolitical dynamics and societal discontent, is \nmore likely to incentivize the replacement of lower-\nskilled, routine jobs (muscle to machine power) \nthan encourage immigration and improved labour \nmobility. Indeed, grappling with shrinking and ageing \nworkforces, companies in advanced economies will \nseek to capitalize on the productivity benefits offered \nby AI, deploying them rapidly and at scale. Generative \nAI will increasingly be substituted for middle-skilled \nworkers (biological to machine intelligence), particularly \nin the services sector. The rapid deployment of these \ntechnologies could crowd out human competencies \nwithin a relatively short period of time \u2013 leading to \nshifts from talent shortages to underemployment and \nunemployment in some parts of these economies and \ncreating knock-on effects in developing economies.\nIndex (2005=100)\n200\n300\n400\n500\n100\n2022\n2005\n2010\n2015\n2020\n0\n20\n40\n60\nService exports, selected economies and economy groups\n\nA.

In light of \ndomestic challenges and declining international \ncooperation, there is a risk of an accompanying \nrise in deprivation. The distribution of aid could \nbecome primarily driven by narrow security \ninterests, rather than broader, traditional \n \n \ndevelopment imperatives, resulting in selective \nefforts to create good for a few, rather than \ngood for all. For example, aid financing could \nbe diverted from nature restoration or education \nto the building of dual-use infrastructure such \nas ports. Amid slowing growth, investment \nfrom China could dry up further, resulting in \ncancellations and delays of critical infrastructure \nprojects, destabilizing low- and middle-income \ncountries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.98 \nStranded people\nIndividual pathways to economic prosperity could \nalso diverge because of these twin economic \ntransitions, perpetuating technological, educational \nand societal divides. In the absence of effective \npolicies encouraging reskilling alongside labour \nand social mobility, access to income opportunities \nwill narrow for a widening segment of the global \npopulation, creating pockets of unemployment and \neconomic distress that impact blue- and white-\ncollar workers alike. \nThis disruption is imminent but may catch the \nworkforce by surprise. For example, four in 10 \nexecutives believe AI will lead to net job losses this \nyear \u2013 compared to only one in 10 employees.99 \nEOS results point to a potential skills gap within \nseveral countries, suggesting that domestic workers \nwill face barriers to matching job demand within the \nnext two years. Respondents in numerous countries \nselected both Unemployment and Labour \nshortages in their top 10 rankings (). \nThis includes a range of high-, upper-middle, and \nlower-middle income countries, such as the United \nArab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, T\u00fcrkiye, South \nAfrica, Australia, Brazil and Argentina. \nThe latest estimates suggest that three in \nfive workers will require training before 2027. \nHowever, barriers of socioeconomic class and \nage may hinder economic mobility, entrenching \nexisting inequalities. For example, despite AI-\ndriven advances in education, not all workers \u2013 \nbetween and within countries \u2013 will have access \nto adequate reskilling opportunities.100 Those with \nthe economic resources to adapt to new industries \nwill have a better chance at maintaining economic \nstability and capture higher wages. Those without \naccess to quality retraining will be forced into \nless stable or secure means of employment. \nAdditionally, the automation of entry level functions \ncould create a higher educational barrier to entry \ninto the workforce, magnifying challenges of \nsocial mobility. Over the longer term, the jobs of \nhigher-skilled, more expensive workers may also \ncome under threat from both machine intelligence \nand machine power, with barriers arising due \nto skills obsolescence and atrophy, as well as \nadvancements in technology. \nFeliphe Schiarolli, \nUnsplash The next global shock?\nB O X  2 . 9\nGreen lash meets tech lash\nDeepening frustration with economic conditions \nwill drive societal divisions, as individuals demand \nbetter opportunities, income equality and \nimproved living standards. The anti-tech and anti-\nsustainability backlash will be fueled by workers \nthreatened by these two transitions. Related \nstrikes and riots could grow, disrupting business \ncontinuity on a regular basis and disrupting \nessential infrastructure, from financial institutions \nto public services and transport. Both \n \n \nwhite- and blue-collar displacement could feature \nheavily in political platforms during election cycles, \ninteracting to polarize electorates in some cases \nor align historically unlikely groupings in others. \nThis could be a dynamic to watch in upcoming \nelections in both the United States and United \nKingdom, where trade unions have historically \nrepresented key parts of voting coalitions, and \nwhose electoral power could ultimately slow the \nrollout of the twin economic transitions. \nIf adequate social protection systems are not in \nplace, displaced workers who struggle to re-enter \nthe workforce could face higher rates of poverty, \nhunger and homelessness, particularly in the near \nterm if costs and inflation remain higher for longer. \nAccess to basic necessities, including healthcare \nand housing, could become restricted. In the \nabsence of supported pathways to safe and secure \nlivelihoods, more individuals could also be pushed \ninto crime, militarization or radicalization (Chapter \n2.6: Crime wave). Forced economic displacement \ncould become more common, with individuals \nmigrating in search of better economic opportunity \nand, possibly, social assistance \u2013 yet even this may \nbe a pathway that some individuals cannot afford. \nWhile many of these consequences may be felt \nmost acutely in developing economies, with less \nfiscal space to ease the transition for individuals, \nthese risks remain a concern in advanced \neconomies, too. For example, workers from \n\u201cdirty\u201d sectors could become stranded in fossil \nfuel-dependent local economies, with few other \nopportunities available. Displaced older workers will \nexacerbate the growing strain on social systems \nand healthcare, creating a different but related \nlivelihood crisis: growing retirement insecurity. \nAnticipated job disruption could also enable \nknowledge, technology, income and wealth to \nbecome even more concentrated, perpetuating \ncycles of poverty. An individual born into a less \nprivileged background is likely to face formidable \nand potentially higher barriers to reaching their full \npotential, undermining notions of meritocracy and \nfairness that underpin stable and inclusive societies.\nDelia Giandeini, \nUnsplash Stalled living standards\nAs the livelihoods and well-being of individuals \ncome under threat, fiscal space and political \nappetite will interact to shape the response of \ngovernments in both advanced and developing \neconomies. If these economic transformations are \nnot managed carefully, related economic hardship \ncould mean that metrics of human development \u2013 \nfrom poverty to access to education and healthcare \n\u2013 recede for large swathes of the global population. \nAnd if standards of living are not preserved for the \ncurrent and next generation, societal and political \ndynamics could radically shift in many economies.\nAs outlined in last year\u2019s Global Risks Report \n(Chapter 2.6: Economic stability), competing \ndemands for investment mean that few countries \nare likely to have the fiscal headroom to invest in \nhuman capital for the longer term \u2013 in education \nand healthcare systems, components that are \nfundamental to the realization of economic \nopportunities. This will be felt most acutely in the \nmost vulnerable markets, which as previously \nnoted, could face a potential investment crisis \nwith corrosive long-term impacts. As fiscal \nspace is squeezed and private finance remains \nconstrained, these markets will be increasingly \nforced to choose between, for instance, paying \nexternal debt, providing a strong and immediate \nsafety net for struggling individuals, investing in \nthe future growth dividends offered by climate \naction and technological development, managing \nand adapting to climate change, or shoring up the \nlonger-term adaptive capacities of human capital \nthrough health and education systems.\nIn this environment, public demands for more \ninterventionist governments may recalibrate fiscal \npolicies, with governments facing increasing \npressure to implement policies that prioritize \ngenerous safety nets and employment stability. \nSupport for technological (automation or AI) taxes \nand wealth redistribution could grow.101 Generally, \nhowever, given debt sustainability concerns, the \nability of governments to afford to mitigate the risks \nof climate- and AI-related job displacement on \nindividuals \u2013 through higher unemployment benefits, \nmore generous minimum wages or subsidies for \nretraining for example \u2013 will be driven partially by \nrelated productivity enhancements, leading to \ngrowth in GDP and tax revenue. As labour markets \nbifurcate, the ability of governments to support their \nworkforces through these radical transformations, \nand maintain developmental progress and \nstandards of living, could diverge in turn. \nIn economies where government efforts are \u2013 or \nare seen to be \u2013 inadequate, populist movements \nwill capitalize on the disillusionment of the \nlower- and middle-classes, who see very little \nopportunity in their own and their children\u2019s future. \nAlthough it may equally encourage innovation \nand entrepreneurship, an aspiration gap will fuel \nfrustration. Digitally connected people in developing \nand advanced economies alike will see a better \nlife elsewhere, but limited economic opportunities \nin their own environment will prevent them from \naccessing this level of living standards. Even small \nshifts in access to income and opportunity \u2013 \nperceived or actual \u2013 may spark protests and civil \nunrest and deepen anti-immigration sentiment and \nhate crimes against migrant populations. In the \nmost extreme scenarios, discontent with the status \nquo could even push societies towards more open \nrebellion and calls for regime change. \nNick Van Den Berg, \nUnsplash Risk governance: End of development?\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks\nPerception Survey 2023-2024.\n\u201cWhich approach(es) do you expect to have the most potential for driving action on risk reduction and preparedness over the next 10 \nyears?

With careful management \nand a degree of international cooperation, \neffective labour and social mobility can ensure that \nprosperity, rather than risks, are shared across \nborders, unleashing productivity benefits offered \nby both economic transformations, and enhancing \nhuman development. \nFor example, while Unemployment is considered \nto be addressed primarily by Corporate strategies \nand National and local regulations (), a \nrise in remote work and non-traditional employment \narrangements, alongside technology and skills \ntransfers, could help address global inequalities \nin access to economic opportunities. Current \nefforts to reshape the global tax regime should also \ntarget emerging sources of inequity and support \ndeveloping markets in capturing a share of the \nnext generation of value chains. The support of \nmultilateral and international finance mechanisms \ncould also reduce real and perceived risks in the \nmost vulnerable countries to unlock financing flows. \nThe expanded use of guarantees could broaden \nthe potential private investor base \u2013 or blended \nfinance structures, including with the support of \nphilanthropic investors, could improve the perceived \nrisk-return profile, opening these investment \nopportunities to institutional investors.102 \nIn the face of these structural shifts to the \nemployment landscape, very few demographic \ngroups, industries or countries can remain \ncomplacent. Recognizing that both the impacts of \nclimate and AI on job markets will not be uniform, \nsolutions to improve economic mobility must be \ntailored to address specific vulnerabilities, such \nas labour shortages, on an industry- and country-\nlevel basis. For example, human capital that is \n\u201cstranded\u201d by the green transition \u2013 i.e., displaced \nworkers from carbon-intensive industries \u2013 could \nhelp address green labour shortages if geographic, \neconomic or skills barriers can be overcome. A \nstronger focus on sectors that go beyond narrow \ndefinitions of tech and green, such as health, care, \neducation, tourism, hospitality, agriculture, personal \nservices and culture \u2013 each of which tends to \nfavour human traits and generate large-scale \nemployment \u2013 can also help countries support the \nstructural transitions of their labour markets and \nworkforces. The public and private sector will need \nto work together to ensure the skills transition from \nsunset to sunrise roles.

The latest \ndata suggests that activity has already started to \nrise across all criminal markets and actors (Figure \n2.25).103 Notwithstanding a drop in homicide rates, \norganized crime remains a significant contributor to \nlethal violence: between 2000 and 2019, it resulted \nin roughly the same number of killings as all armed \nconflicts across the world combined, at a rate of \napproximately 65,000 deaths per year.104\nIllicit economic activity is an under-the-radar \nrisk \u2013 it ranks comparatively low in terms of \nperceived severity over both the two- and 10-\nyear time horizons, at #28 and #31 respectively \n(). While narrower than the definition \nadopted by the GRPS, this section will focus \nspecifically on organized crime in light of these \nrecent data trends to explore whether emerging \ngeostrategic, environmental, demographic and \ntechnological forces could turn the already-chronic \nrisk of organized crime into a pressing crisis over \nthe next decade. Indeed, many of the perceived \ndrivers to Illicit economic activity are among the \nmost severe perceived risks over the short- and \nlonger-term horizon. It is among the top 10 most \nconnected risks in the network, seen to be driven \nby Economic downturn, Lack of economic \nopportunity, Cyber insecurity and Involuntary \nmigration, together with Unemployment, \nIntrastate violence and Geoeconomic \nconfrontation, among others ().\nThere are three concurrent trends that will fuel \ncrime syndicates and related illicit markets over the \nnext decade. First, societal fragility, arising from \ngeopolitical, socioeconomic and environmental \nvulnerabilities, may drive an expansion in illicit \nmarkets. In parallel, advances in technology will \nbreak down barriers to entry \u2013 borders, languages, \nskill sets \u2013 opening alternate revenue streams, \nparticularly in the cyber domain, and allowing \ntransnational criminal networks to spread. Finally, \nthe erosion of legitimate governance may create \na vacuum of power for criminal organizations to \nflourish, contesting fragile regimes for territorial \ncontrol, or capitalizing on lucrative partnerships with \nstate actors.

Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is \na revenue stream that can be engaged in with relative \nimpunity, with jurisdictional challenges hampering \nenforcement. The practice also complements other \nforms of marine trafficking, including drugs and \npeople.111 \nAt the same time, socioeconomic vulnerabilities \narising from these same trends will heighten \nexposure to criminal networks. Conflict- or climate-\nrelated migration will likely drive exploitation \nby criminal actors engaging in, for example, \nchild labour and cyber slavery.112 Additionally, \nsocial disintegration, urban segregation, poverty \nand economic inequalities are all well-known \nOrganized crime\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks \nPerception Survey 2023-2024. \nEdges\nRelative in\ufb02uence\nHigh\nLow\nMedium\nRisk in\ufb02uence\nNodes\nHigh\nLow\nMedium\nRisk categories\nEconomic\nEnvironmental\nGeopolitical\nSocietal\nTechnological\nReference\nRisk interconnections: Illicit economic activity and Cyber insecurity\nCensorship and surveillance\nAdverse outcomes of\nfrontier technologies\nCyber insecurity\nAdverse outcomes\nof AI technologies\nMisinformation and disinformation\nTerrorist attacks\nDisruptions to\ncritical infrastructure\nDisruptions to a systemically\nimportant supply chain\nCensorship and surveillance\nAdverse outcomes of\nfrontier technologies\nCyber insecurity\nAdverse outcomes\nof AI technologies\nMisinformation and disinformation\nTechnological power\nconcentration\nIntrastate violence\nLack of economic opportunity\nGeoeconomic confrontation\nUnemployment\nDebt\nIn\ufb02ation\nIllicit economic activity\nInvoluntary migration\nConcentration of\nstrategic resources\nEconomic downturn\nTechnological power\nconcentration\nLack of economic opportunity\nSocietal\npolarization\nSocietal\npolarization potential drivers of criminal activity and could \nlead more people towards criminal activity.113 \nUnemployment is seen to be the strongest \ndriver of Illicit economic activity (selected by \nmore than 40% of GRPS respondents). If poverty \nand unemployment become chronic concerns in \ncountries vulnerable to livelihood crises (Chapter \n2.5: End of development?), crime may become \nthe predominant source of income and the only way \nto access necessities for some communities. \nCyber vulnerabilities\nIn parallel, rapid integration of advanced \ntechnologies are exposing a broader subset \nof the global population to potential digital and \nphysical exploitation. Organized crime networks will \nincreasingly adopt blended business models utilizing \nnew technologies to diversify illicit funding and \nfragment the physical presence of organized crime. \nThis will pose significant risks to individuals and \nlegal businesses \u2013 and has the potential to lead to \nviolence that challenges the power of governments \nand threatens the territorial control of states.114\nNew tools and capabilities will open new markets \nfor criminal networks, with cybercrime offering an \nincreasingly low-risk and low-cost revenue stream for \norganized crime.115 Phishing attacks, for example, can \nnow be easily and accurately translated into minority \nlanguages using generative AI. Over the coming \nyears, more sophisticated cyber defenses will shift \ntargets towards less digitally literate individuals or less \nsecure infrastructure and systems. Already prevalent \nin Latin America, cybercrime will continue to spread \nto parts of Asia and West and Southern Africa, as \naffluency grows and internet connectivity brings large \nswathes of the global population online.116 \n\u201cWhich \ufb01ve risks are the most likely to pose the biggest threat to your country in the next two years?\u201d\nNew Zealand\nUnited Arab Emirates\nBahrain\nJordan\nOman\nSaudi Arabia\nYemen\nEgypt\nKuwait\nQatar\nIraq\nIran\nAlgeria\nCanada\nUnited States of America\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo\nAngola\nSouth Africa\nRwanda\nBenin\nKenya\nBotswana\nC\u00f4te D'Ivoire\nTanzania\nMali\nCameroon\nPakistan\nLao PDR\nViet Nam\nMalaysia\nPhilippines\nIndonesia\nThailand\nSingapore\nVenezuela\nBolivia\nColombia\nEcuador\nMexico\nParaguay\nGuatemala\nBrazil\nJamaica\nSerbia\nBulgaria\nBelgium\nNorth Macedonia\nHungary\nItaly\nUkraine\nLatvia\nT\u00fcrkiye\nUnited Kingdom\nGermany\nSweden\nPortugal\nCzechia\nLithuania\nDenmark\nMongolia\nSouth Korea\nJapan\nKazakhstan\nTunisia\nMorocco\nNigeria\nTop 10\nGeorgia\nArmenia\nKyrgyzstan\nUzbekistan\nAustralia\nBangladesh\nNepal\nSri Lanka\nIndia\n1st\n10th\n20th\n30th\n36th\nRisk ranking\nCentral Asia\nEastern Asia\nEurope\nLatin America and\nthe Caribbean\nMiddle East and\nNorthern Africa\nNorthern America\nOceania\nSouth-eastern Asia\nSouthern Asia\nSub-Saharan Africa\n0\nLow\nHigh\n4\n2\n6\n10\nCriminality score\n8\nNational risk perceptions, by region: Cybercrime and cyber insecurity\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Executive Opinion Survey 2023;\nGlobal Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, 2023.\nNote\nThe colour of the data points re\ufb02ects countries\u2019 criminality scores, which are based on the Global \nOrganized Crime Index 2023.

The adoption of \nthese digitally blended models, leveraging cyber \nand physical revenue streams, was seen by some \nexperts consulted to potentially lead to a drop in \nviolence if these activities supersede alternate forms \nof illicit revenue, such as drug trafficking. Notably, \nhowever, the destructive influence of cybercrime \nputs more civilians at risk than when concentrated \nbetween criminal actors in intergang warfare, in \naddition to being associated with other forms of \nphysical violence, such as human trafficking.117\nOrganized crime groups will also increasingly utilize \ntechnologies118 to enable geographic expansion \nof their networks to strengthen strategic footholds \nof economic and political activity. Enabled by \ntechnology, crime networks can spread to exploit \nheightened demand, regulatory and enforcement \ngaps, and negative public perceptions of police \nand state legitimacy, with financing, suppliers, \ncustomers and violence originating in separate \nmarkets.119 EOS results suggest that this may \nbe an underappreciated risk among business \nperceptions, with more traditional forms of crime \n\u2013 including illicit trade and trafficking \u2013 anticipated \nto remain largely concentrated in Latin America \nand the Caribbean over the next two years (Figure \n2.28).

Technology-enabled proliferation of illicit activities \nin new markets and geographies could have \nnumerous implications at a state, company and \nindividual level. Alongside cybersecurity concerns, it \ncould expose businesses to a range of heightened \nrisks, from reputational threats and regulatory \nscrutiny relating to financial flows and supply \nchains to impacts on the long-term viability and \nsuccess of legitimate markets. In more extreme \nscenarios, geographic expansion of these criminal \nsyndicates could also lead to political violence that \nchallenges the power of governments, mirroring \nrecent developments throughout Latin America \nand the Caribbean, such as in Haiti.120 A rise in \n\u201cungoverned\u201d spaces will also likely be seen in \nthe growth of armed and radicalized groups and \ndisenchanted youths in many cities throughout the \ndeveloped world, threatening public safety and \nsecurity.\nThe next global shock?\nB O X  2 . 1 0\nGlobal fentanyl epidemic\nEnforcement of the Taliban\u2019s ban and the near \neradication of poppy production in Afghanistan \ncould have widespread implications for the global \ndrug trade.121 Historically accounting for around \n80% of opium production, Afghanistan\u2019s rapid \nshortfall in supply could be largely met through \nsynthetic drugs. Fentanyl, for example, offers \nsignificant advantages to crime groups: it is \nless labour-intensive, requires smaller volumes \nof precursor materials and offers a lower cost \nrevenue stream. Some experts consulted \nreferenced early signs of on-shored production  \n \n \nin industrialized economies, enabled by \u201ccrime \nas a service\u201d construction of illicit laboratories. \nConcerningly, however, fentanyl is far more potent \nthan natural opium, with severe health implications \nif it were to penetrate markets more broadly. It is \nthe leading cause of death in young adults in the \nUnited States, with overdose deaths attributable \nto fentanyl use reaching almost 110,000 in 2022 \n\u2013 although the United States and China recently \nreached a deal to limit the export of pre-cursor \nchemicals.122 \nRandy Laybourne, \nUnsplash\nState-enabled criminality\nGrowing state fragility will strengthen the ease and \nattractiveness of these parallel economies for a \nbroader set of actors, either because of reduced \nstate capacity to respond or, in some cases, \nblurring of the lines between criminals and the state. \nIndeed, the state itself could support or become \nsusceptible to organized crime over the next \ndecade.123 \nFueled by fragility, more widespread corruption \ncould create a vicious cycle whereby states are \nunable to rebuild the resilience to effectively \ncounter organized crime and could instead be \ncaptured by criminal networks. For example, \ncorruption could effectively lead to control of \ntransportation hubs, law enforcement and \nparts of the public sector by organized crime \ngroups.124 This in turn would undermine the rule \nof law, distort competition and weaken economic \ngrowth further, eroding both societal trust and \nenforcement capacities.  depicts \nthis symbiotic relationship, whereby criminality is \ngenerally found hand-in-hand with fragile states \nthat have higher levels of conflict and corruption.\nState \u201csponsorship\u201d of illicit activities may also \nbecome more common (Box 2.11). In cyberspace, \nfor example, commodified products (including \nransomware) and services-for-hire (such as money \nlaundering) are now easily accessible for less \ntechnically competent actors.126 This includes Crime and state fragility\n\nSource\nGlobal Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, 2023; \nFund for Peace, 2023; Institute for Economics & Peace, 2023; \nTransparency International, 2023.\nNote\nLarge, red dots in the top right indicate countries with high levels of fragility, corruption and \ncriminality, and low levels of peacefulness.

Symbiotic partnerships \nbetween states and organized crime could grow, \nsuch as in acquiring the data of investigative \njournalists amid a broader crackdown on \ninformation flows (Chapter 1.3: False information), \nin return for concessions and bilateral agreements.\nState-sponsored groups may increasingly adopt \nblended business models, undertaking both licit and \nillicit activities. For example, the Wagner Group is a \nprivate military company that has been designated \nas a \u201ctransnational criminal organization\u201d by the \nUnited States. The organization has a network of \neconomic entities, including mining companies, \nparticularly across Africa.128 The presence of these \ngroups could further fuel the cycle between conflict, \nfragility, corruption and crime, particularly where the \nstate does not have the capacity to enforce legal \nrights. Not only can the presence of these groups \ndrive lethal violence, but they also offer an economic \npathway for illicit activities as other pathways stall. \nFor example, climate change has led to a decline in \narable land and fish stocks in Lake Chad, prompting \nsome individuals to join armed groups as an \nalternative source of income.129 The next global shock?\nB O X  2 . 1 1\nState criminal\nIn a more extreme scenario, the state itself may \nbecome the criminal. Cybercrime could create \nlucrative illicit funding streams that are difficult \nto attribute to any particular state and that can \nbe used for government services, illegal political \nactivities (such as assassinations or disinformation \ncampaigns) or even political campaigns. For  \n \n \nexample, North Korea stole $200 million in \ncryptocurrencies over an eight-month period \nlast year, allegedly to fund their nuclear weapons \nprogramme.130 Autocratic governments, fragile \nregimes and \u201cungoverned states\u201d are more \nsusceptible to such capture. \nActing today\nTo effectively prevent the spread of illicit activity \nacross both geographic and economic markets, \nthree key areas could be tackled: the capability to \nlaunder illicit profits; communications that enable \nextensive criminal networks; and corruption.131 For \nexample, while the counter-risk of surveillance needs \nto be handled carefully, the dismantling of encrypted \ncommunications could be a radical tool to disrupt \ntransnational crime networks. The takedown of \nEncroChat, for instance, led to 6,558 arrests and \nclose to EUR900 million in criminal funds seized or \nfrozen.132 All three pillars can be tackled at multiple \nlayers of governance; however, GRPS respondents \nfeel that National and local regulations have the \nmost potential for driving action on risk reduction \nand preparedness with respect to Illicit economic \nactivity ().\nWith constraints to international cooperation, \nthere may be a shift towards unilateral, bilateral \nand regional agreements on crime, although \nthese may prove less effective at addressing \ntransnational criminal networks that transcend \npolitical alliances and country borders.

This \nchapter addresses the outlook for the first two \ntime frames and examines selected risks that are \nlikely to heighten by 2026. Chapter 2 addresses \nthe 10-year outlook and how evolving risks may \ninteract to create four potential high-risk outlooks \nfor the world. The third and final chapter examines \nthe concept of cooperation, showcasing different \napproaches to address global risks.\nThe aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic and \nongoing Russia-Ukraine war has exposed cracks \nin societies that are being further strained by \nepisodic upheaval. Yet the global system has thus \nfar proved surprisingly resilient. A widely anticipated \nrecession failed to materialize last year, and financial \nturbulence was quickly subdued, but the outlook \nremains uncertain.1 Political strife and violent \nconflicts, from Niger and Sudan to Gaza and Israel, \nhave captured the attention and apprehension of \npopulations worldwide in some instances while \nattracting little focus in others. These developments \nhave not yet led to wider regional conflicts \u2013 \nnor have they created globally destabilizing \nconsequences such as those seen at the initial \noutbreak of the war in Ukraine or the COVID-19 \npandemic \u2013 but their long-term outlook could bring \nfurther shocks.\nAs we enter 2024, results of the Forum\u2019s Global \nRisks Perception Survey 2023-2024 (GRPS) \nhighlight a predominantly negative outlook for \nthe world over the short term that is expected to \nworsen over the long term ().

The \nCost-of-living crisis is ranked higher by younger \nage groups: it was selected by 55% of respondents \naged 39 or below, compared to just 28% of those \naged 60 or over.4 \nAlthough energy and food crises ranked among \nthe top risks of 2023, this year less than one-fifth \nof respondents selected Disrupted supply chains \nfor food (18%) or Disrupted supply chains for \nenergy (14%) as core concerns for 2024. The \nsurvey was conducted in September of 2023, \nthus the outlook may have since shifted given the \nconflict in the Middle East, particularly if hostilities \nescalate. Climate pressures may yet drive prices \nhigher;5 however, a warmer winter in the Northern \nHemisphere, for example, followed by the easing of \nthe El Ni\u00f1o cycle over the summer, could partially \nalleviate further energy price spikes resulting from \nany escalation of the Israel-Gaza or Russia-Ukraine \nconflicts.\nNotably, while the survey was conducted before \nthe outbreak of the former conflict, a quarter of \nrespondents rank the Escalation or outbreak of \ninterstate armed conflict(s) (25%) as among the \ntop five risks for 2024, pointing to a broader set of \nconcerns. At more than 200,000 deaths in 2022, \nconflict deaths are at the highest level in decades, \ndriven predominantly by state-based armed conflict.6\nRisks relating to the financial, tech and real-estate \nsectors are towards the bottom of respondents\u2019 \nconcerns for 2024.\nWeakened systems only require the smallest \nshock to edge past the tipping point of resilience. \nIn the second time frame covered by the survey, \nrespondents were asked to rank the likely impact \nof risks in the next two years. The results suggest \nthat corrosive socioeconomic vulnerabilities will be \namplified in the near term, with looming concerns \nabout an Economic downturn (Chapter 1.5), \nresurgent risks such as Interstate armed conflict \n(Chapter 1.4), and rapidly evolving risks like \nMisinformation and disinformation (Chapter 1.3).\nAs discussed in last year\u2019s Global Risks Report, less \npredictable and harder-to-handle inflation heightens \nthe risk of miscalibration of efforts to balance \nprice stability and economic growth (Chapter \n1.5: Economic uncertainty). Economic risks \nare notable new entrants to the top 10 rankings \nthis year, with both Inflation (#7) and Economic \ndownturn (#9) featuring in the two-year time \nframe (). Economic risks are prioritized in \nparticular by public- and private-sector respondents \n(). Geoeconomic confrontation (#14) \nis a marked absence from the top 10 rankings this \nyear () and has decreased in perceived \nseverity compared to last year\u2019s scores. However, \nlike related economic risks, it features among the \ntop concerns for both public- and private-sector \nrespondents (at #10 and #11, respectively) as a \ncontinuing source of economic volatility.\nThe path to 2026\n1.2\nGlobal risks ranked by severity over the short term (2 years)\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks\nPerception Survey 2023-2024.\n\"Please estimate the likely impact (severity) of the following risks over a 2-year period.\"\n6th\n7th\n8th\n9th\n10th\nLack of economic opportunity\nIn\ufb02ation\nInvoluntary migration\nEconomic downturn\nPollution\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\n4th\n5th\nMisinformation and disinformation\nExtreme weather events\nSocietal polarization\nCyber insecurity\nInterstate armed con\ufb02ict\nRisk categories\nEconomic\nEnvironmental\nGeopolitical\nSocietal\nTechnological Geoeconomic confrontation\nUnemployment\nBiological, chemical\nor nuclear hazards\nDebt\nTechnological power\nconcentration\nMisinformation and\ndisinformation\nInterstate armed\ncon\ufb02ict\nInsuf\ufb01cient public infrastructure\nand services\nExtreme weather\nSocietal polarization\nCyber insecurity\nInvoluntary migration\n-\n2\n4\n2\n17\n15\n9\n9\n11\n11\n10\n5\n14th\n30th\n31st\n16th\n12th\n1st\n5th\n18th\n2nd\n3rd\n4th\n8th\nPersistent concerns\nBiggest increase in ranking\nBiggest fall in ranking\nOverall ranking\nAnnual change in global risk perceptions over the short term (2 years)\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks\nPerception Surveys 2022-2023 and 2023-2024.\nNote\nBolded risks refer to global risks that are currently in the short-term top 10 risks list, or were \nformerly in the top 10 in GRPS 2022-2023.

In the next two years, a wide set \nof actors will capitalize on the boom in synthetic \ncontent,8 amplifying societal divisions, ideological \nviolence and political repression \u2013 ramifications that \nwill persist far beyond the short term. \nMisinformation and disinformation (#1) is a new \nleader of the top 10 rankings this year. No longer \nrequiring a niche skill set, easy-to-use interfaces \nto large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models \nhave already enabled an explosion in falsified \ninformation and so-called \u2018synthetic\u2019 content, \nfrom sophisticated voice cloning to counterfeit \nwebsites. To combat growing risks, governments \nare beginning to roll out new and evolving \nregulations to target both hosts and creators of \nonline disinformation and illegal content.9 Nascent \nregulation of generative AI will likely complement \nthese efforts. For example, requirements in China \nto watermark AI-generated content may help \nidentify false information, including unintentional \nmisinformation through AI hallucinated content.10 \nGenerally however, the speed and effectiveness \nof regulation is unlikely to match the pace of \ndevelopment. \nSynthetic content will manipulate individuals, \ndamage economies and fracture societies in \nnumerous ways over the next two years. Falsified \ninformation could be deployed in pursuit of diverse \ngoals, from climate activism to conflict escalation. \nNew classes of crimes will also proliferate, such \nas non-consensual deepfake pornography or \nstock market manipulation.11 However, even \nas the insidious spread of misinformation and \ndisinformation threatens the cohesion of societies, \nthere is a risk that some governments will act \ntoo slowly, facing a trade-off between preventing \nmisinformation and protecting free speech, while \nrepressive governments could use enhanced \nregulatory control to erode human rights.\nJason Goodman, Unsplash National risk perceptions in the context of upcoming elections\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Executive Opinion Survey 2023; \nWorldometer, 2023; Statista, 2023; DataReportal, 2023.\n\u201cWhich five risks are most likely to pose the biggest threat to your country in the next two years?\u201d\nMisinformation and disinformation \n1st\n10th\n20th\n30th 36th\nRank\nNote\nEU excludes Slovakia.\n18th risk in Indonesia\nNearly 278m (88% internet penetration) head\nfor a presidential election in March 2024\n22nd risk in South Africa\nOver 60m (72% internet penetration)\nhead for a general election in 2024\nRussia\nAround 145m (88% internet penetration)\nhead for a presidential election in March 2024\n1st risk in India\nOver 1.4bn (nearly 50% internet penetration) \nhead for a general election in April-May 2024\n6th risk in the United States\nNearly 340m (92% internet penetration) head \nfor a presidential election in November 2024\n8th risk in European Union\nNearly 450m (89% internet penetration)\nelect the EU Parliament in June 2024\n11th risk in United Kingdom\nNearly 68m (98% internet penetration)\nhead for a general election by January 2025\n11th risk in Mexico\n128m (79% internet penetration) head for a \ngeneral election in June 2024\nMistrust in elections\nOver the next two years, close to three billion \npeople will head to the electoral polls across \nseveral economies, including the United States, \nIndia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and Indonesia \n().12 The presence of misinformation \nand disinformation in these electoral processes \ncould seriously destabilize the real and perceived \nlegitimacy of newly elected governments, risking \npolitical unrest, violence and terrorism, and a \nlonger-term erosion of democratic processes.\nRecent technological advances have enhanced the \nvolume, reach and efficacy of falsified information, \nwith flows more difficult to track, attribute and \ncontrol. The capacity of social media companies to \nensure platform integrity will likely be overwhelmed \nin the face of multiple overlapping campaigns.13 \nDisinformation will also be increasingly personalized \nto its recipients and targeted to specific groups, \nsuch as minority communities, as well as \ndisseminated through more opaque messaging \nplatforms such as WhatsApp or WeChat.14 \nThe identification of AI-generated mis- and \ndisinformation in these campaigns will not be \nclear-cut. The difference between AI- and human-\ngenerated content is becoming more difficult to \ndiscern, not only for digitally literate individuals, but \nalso for detection mechanisms.15 Research and \ndevelopment continues at pace, but this area of \ninnovation is radically underfunded in comparison \nto the underlying technology.16 Moreover, even \nif synthetic content is labelled as such,17 these \nlabels are often digital and not visible to consumers \nof content or appear as warnings that still allow \nthe information to spread. Such information can \nthus still be emotively powerful, blurring the line \nbetween malign and benign use. For example, an \nAI-generated campaign video could influence voters \nand fuel protests, or in more extreme scenarios, \nlead to violence or radicalization, even if it carries a \nwarning by the platform on which it is shared that it \nis fabricated content.18 \nThe implications of these manipulative campaigns \ncould be profound, threatening democratic \nprocesses. If the legitimacy of elections is \nquestioned, civil confrontation is possible \u2013 and could \neven expand to internal conflicts and terrorism, and \nstate collapse in more extreme cases. Depending \non the systemic importance of an economy, there \nis also a risk to global trade and financial markets. \nState-backed campaigns could deteriorate interstate \nrelations, by way of strengthened sanctions regimes, \ncyber offense operations with related spillover risks, \nand detention of individuals (including targeting \nprimarily based on nationality, ethnicity and religion).19 Societies divided\nMisinformation and disinformation and Societal \npolarization are seen by GRPS respondents to be \nthe most strongly connected risks in the network, \nwith the largest potential to amplify each other. \nIndeed, polarized societies are more likely to trust \ninformation (true or false) that confirms their beliefs. \nGiven distrust in the government and media as \nsources of false information,20 manipulated content \nmay not be needed \u2013 merely raising a question as \nto whether it has been fabricated may be sufficient \nto achieve relevant objectives. This then sows the \nseeds for further polarization. \nAs identified in last year\u2019s Global Risks Report \n(Chapter 1.2: Societal polarization), the \nconsequences could be vast. Societies may become \npolarized not only in their political affiliations, but \nalso in their perceptions of reality, posing a serious \nchallenge to social cohesion and even mental health. \nWhen emotions and ideologies overshadow facts, \nmanipulative narratives can infiltrate the public \ndiscourse on issues ranging from public health to \nsocial justice and education to the environment. \nFalsified information can also fuel animosity, from \nbias and discrimination in the workplace to violent \nprotests, hate crimes and terrorism. \nSome governments and platforms, aiming to \nprotect free speech and civil liberties, may fail to act \nto effectively curb falsified information and harmful \ncontent, making the definition of \u201ctruth\u201d increasingly \ncontentious across societies. State and non-state \nactors alike may leverage false information to widen \nfractures in societal views, erode public confidence \nin political institutions, and threaten national \ncohesion and coherence.

Governments themselves will be increasingly \nin a position to determine what is true, potentially \nallowing political parties to monopolize the public \ndiscourse and suppress dissenting voices, including \njournalists and opponents.25 Individuals have already \nbeen imprisoned in Belarus and Nicaragua, and \nkilled in Myanmar and Iran, for online speech.26\nSpenser H, Unsplash Misinformation\nand disinformation\nCensorship and surveillance\nAdverse outcomes of\nfrontier technologies\nCyber insecurity\nAdverse outcomes\nof AI technologies\nTechnological power\nconcentration\nIntrastate violence\nTerrorist attacks\nErosion of human rights\nSocietal\npolarization\nInterstate armed con\ufb02ict\nInfectious diseases\nRisk interconnections\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks \nPerception Survey 2023-2024. \nEdges\nRelative in\ufb02uence\nHigh\nLow\nMedium\nRisk in\ufb02uence\nNodes\nHigh\nLow\nMedium\nRisk categories\nEconomic\nEnvironmental\nGeopolitical\nSocietal\nTechnological\nReference\nMisinformation and disinformation\nThe export of authoritarian digital norms to a wider \nset of countries could create a vicious cycle: the \nrisk of misinformation quickly descends into the \nwidespread control of information which, in turn, \nleaves citizens vulnerable to political repression \nand domestic disinformation.27 GRPS respondents \nhighlight strong bilateral relationships between \nMisinformation and disinformation, Censorship \nand surveillance (#21) and the Erosion of human \nrights (#15), indicating a higher perceived likelihood \nof all three risks occurring together ().\nThis is a particular concern in those countries \nfacing upcoming elections, where a crackdown \non real or perceived foreign interference could be \nused to consolidate existing control, particularly in \nflawed democracies or hybrid regimes.

This may include intrastate armed con\ufb02ict \n(occurring between a government and a non-governmental party), internationalized intrastate \narmed con\ufb02ict (occurring between a government, and one or more internal opposition groups, \nwith intervention from other states on either side), and interstate armed con\ufb02ict (occurring \nbetween two or more states or governments). The de\ufb01nition of interstate armed con\ufb02ict adopted \nby the GRPS is broader than the UCDP\u2019s de\ufb01nition of \u201cinterstate armed con\ufb02ict\u201d, encompassing \nsome elements of \u201cinternationalized intrastate armed con\ufb02ict\u201d. \nHigh-stakes hotspots\nOver the next two years, the attention and \nresources of global powers are likely to be focused \non three hotspots in particular: the war in Ukraine, \nthe Israel-Gaza conflict and tensions over Taiwan. \nEscalation in any one of these hotspots would \nradically disrupt global supply chains, financial \nmarkets, security dynamics and political stability, \nviscerally threatening the sense of security and \nsafety of individuals worldwide. \nAll three areas stand at a geopolitical crossroads, \nwhere major powers have vested interests: oil and \ntrade routes in the Middle East, stability and the \nbalance of power in Eastern Europe, and advanced \ntechnological supply chains in East Asia. Each \ncould lead to broader regional destabilization, \ndirectly drawing in major power(s) and escalating \nthe scale of conflict. All three also directly involve \npower(s) reckoned to possess nuclear capabilities. \nOver the next two years, the war in Ukraine could \nsporadically alternate between intensifying and \nrefreezing. Despite sanctions, Russia has continued \nto benefit from energy profits and commodity \nexports \u2013 and this could increase further if the \nconflict in the Middle East widens.31 Pro-Russian \nor neutral sentiment in Eastern and Central Europe \ncould soften support from Ukraine\u2019s European \nallies,32 while support in the United States could \nwane under domestic pressures, other international \npriorities, or under a new government. Global \ndivisions with respect to the Middle East conflict \nmay also complicate efforts by Ukraine to maintain \nunity with Western allies, while also garnering \nsupport from the Global South.33 If the conflict \nintensifies, it is still more likely to do so through \nconventional rather than nuclear means, but it could \nalso expand to neighbouring countries. While post-\nconflict scenarios for both Ukraine and Russia are \ndifficult to predict, the war could \u2018refreeze\u2019 into a \nprolonged, sporadic conflict that could last years or \neven decades.34 Proximate developments in the Middle East are a \nsource of considerable uncertainty, risking further \nindirect or direct confrontation between global \npowers. If the Israel-Gaza conflict destabilizes into \nwider regional warfare, more extensive intervention \nby major powers is possible, including Iran and the \nWest.35 Beyond potentially seismic shocks to global \nenergy prices and supply chains, escalation could \nsplit the attention and resources of the EU and the \nUnited States between Ukraine and Israel.36 The \nscale of Gulf countries\u2019 or Western intervention is \nuncertain; it\u2019s likely to continue to be deeply polarizing \ndomestically and hold significant political sway. \nNumerous GRPS respondents also cited Taiwan \nand disputed territories in East and South-East Asia \nas areas of concern. In contrast to Russia, which \ndoubled its defense spending target to more than \n$100 billion in 2023, and the United States, which \nallocated over $113 billion in assistance relating to \nthe war in Ukraine alone,37 China has largely acted \nas a non-interventionist power in both the Ukraine \nand Middle East conflicts, avoiding the risk of \noverstretch.38 While there is no evidence to suggest \nthat escalation is imminent, there remains a material \npossibility of accidental or intentional outbreak of \nhostilities, given heightened activity in the region.39\nClayton Holmes, \nUnsplash\nConflict contagion\nAs high-stakes hotspots undermine global security, \na wider set of trends may fuel a combustible \nenvironment in which new and existing hostilities are \nmore likely to ignite. As conflicts spread, guardrails \nto their containment are eroding and resolve for \nlong-term solutions have stalled.40 In parallel, the \ninternationalization of conflicts by a wider set of \nalternate powers will accelerate \u2018multipolarity\u2019 and \nthe risk of inadvertent escalation.\nFirst, simmering tensions and frozen conflicts \nthat are proximate to existing hotspots could \nheat up. For example, spillover impacts from a \nhigh concentration of conflicts, such as in Asia \nand Africa (), could range from more \nreadily available arms trafficking to conflict-driven \nmigration. Other states could also deliberately \nstoke tensions in neighbouring countries to divert \nattention and resources, through disinformation \ncampaigns or the deployment of state-backed \nmilitia groups, for example. Frozen conflicts at risk \ncould include the Balkans, Libya, Syria, Kashmir, \nGuyana, the Kurdish region and Korean peninsula.41 \nThese risks are well-recognized by business \nleaders: Interstate armed conflict features as \na top-five risk in 20 countries (18%) surveyed \nin the Forum\u2019s Executive Opinion Survey (EOS, \nsee Appendix C: Executive Opinion Survey: \nNational Risk Perceptions), including Egypt, \nIraq, Kazakhstan and Serbia, and is the top risk in \nArmenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan and Japan.\nSecond, resource stress, economic hardship \nand weakened state capacity will likely grow \nand, in turn, fuel conflict.42 There may also be a \nrise of \u2018ungoverned countries\u2019, where non-state \nactors fight for control over large swathes of \nterritory, or where parties not recognized by the \ninternational system gain full control. For example, \nresource-rich countries could become caught in \na battleground of proxy warfare between multiple \npowers, including neighbouring economies, \norganized crime networks and paramilitary groups \n(Chapter 2.6: Crime wave).43 No. of state-based con\ufb02icts\n40\n50\n60\n0\nRegion\nAmericas\nEurope\nMiddle East\nAsia\nAfrica\n10\n20\n30\nYear\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2022\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nNo. of con\ufb02ict fatalities\n150k\n200k\n250k\n0\nRegion\n50k\n100k\nYear\n2007\n2008\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n2015\n2016\n2022\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\nGeography of violence\n\nSource\nUppsala Con\ufb02ict Data Program (UCDP), 2023.\nNote\nRegions as de\ufb01ned by the UCDP. \nA.

Historical \ngrievances of colonialism, combined with more \nrecent ones regarding the costs of food and fuel, \ngeopolitical alliances, the United Nations and \nBretton Woods systems, and the loss and damage \nagenda, could accelerate anti-Western sentiment \nover the next two years. In conjunction with more \nthinly spread resources and tighter economic \nconditions, military power projection by the West \ncould fade further, potentially creating power \nvacuums in parts of Africa, the Middle East and \nAsia. France, for example, has withdrawn troops on \nrequest from Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger over the \npast two years.44 \nAs the dominance of long-held power centres \nwanes, alternate powers will compete for influence \nin interstate and intrastate conflicts, potentially \nleading to deadlier, prolonged proxy warfare and \noverwhelming humanitarian crises.45 There are \na number of incentives to this involvement, from \naccess to raw resources, such as minerals and \noil, to the protection and promotion of trade, \ninvestment and security interests. Pivotal powers \nwill also increasingly lend support and resources \nto garner political allies, taking advantage of this \nwidening rift between the Global North and the \nGlobal South. \nAs a new set of influences in global affairs takes \nshape, political alliances and alignment within \nthe Global South will also shape the longer-term \ntrajectory of internationalized conflicts.

If price pressures continue, \ncentral banks could be hesitant to cut rates in \nresponse to signals of weaker growth, resulting in \nhigher-for-longer inflation and interest rates.\nReflecting tighter financial conditions, both headline \nand core inflation have dropped in the United States \nand the Eurozone ().49 In parallel, there \nhas been a slowdown in economic growth in key \nindustries and markets.

Yet even as inflation has been partially tamed \nthrough higher interest rates, it has not reached \ncentral bank targets of two percent and there \nremains a material risk of largely supply-side price \npressures over the next two years. For example, \nEl Ni\u00f1o-impacts to food production and logistics \ncould drive inflation and costly disruptions to supply \nchains. Any amplification of the Middle East conflict \ncould trigger price spikes in energy and further \ndisrupt shipping routes, compounding continued \nimpacts from the war in Ukraine.53 The cost-of-\nliving impact of persistent inflation, perceived to be \ndeclining in 2024, could resurge as the continued \nimpact of elevated prices persists. A wage-price \nspiral is still possible, with EOS respondents \nanticipating labour shortages in key sectors and \neconomies over the next two years (Chapter \n2.5: End of development?). Stronger industrial \npolicies and trade controls emanating from \nadvanced economies, targeting the green transition \nand advanced technology, could also remain a \npersistent inflationary trend over this period.\nUncertainty within global \npowerhouses\nThe outlooks for the two largest economies \u2013 China \nand the United States \u2013 are highly complex, and \nthese two key sources of uncertainty could lead to \nunanticipated, and possibly divergent, implications \nfor the trajectory of the global economy. \nChina\u2019s economy is widely expected to slow this \nyear, with the weakening of the property market \nand local and external demand generally cited \nas primary causes.54 Despite retaining its \u2018A1\u2019 \nlong-term credit rating, the outlook for China\u2019s \ngovernment debt was recently downgraded from \n\u2018neutral\u2019 to \u2018negative\u2019, reflecting risks relating \nto \u2018structurally and persistently lower medium-\nterm economic growth\u2019.55 Yet investment in both \nmanufacturing and energy infrastructure have been \nkey drivers of growth in recent years, replacing \nlost construction demand to a degree.56 Although \nchallenges remain, in the absence of further \nshocks, there is room for an upside surprise \u2013 \nlocal consumption may revive, growth may be \nless sluggish and the slowdown shallower than \npervasive market expectations. In addition, in the \nabsence of further geoeconomic backlash, excess \ncapacity in advanced manufacturing, particularly in \ngreen technologies, could help counteract global \nprice pressures, lending momentum to the green \ntransition and global demand.57  \nThere is similar uncertainty in the United States. \nSome forecasts are already pricing in up to 2.4% \neconomic growth for 2024, and others predict rate \ncuts in the early half of the year.58 Fiscal policy has \nremained loose even as monetary policy tightened, \nwith the United States running a $1.7 trillion deficit \nin 2023, effectively doubling the deficit in the past \nyear alone.59 This could continue to keep demand-\ndriven price pressures high. The correlation \nbetween consumer sentiment and spending is also \nadding to uncertainty: economic pessimism may \nbe widespread, but it is not necessarily dampening \ndemand \u2013 yet.60 On the other hand, debt servicing \nhit over $981 billion in Q3 2023 \u2013 an increase of \nover $753 billion compared to the same period in \n2022, a sum similar to the budgetary spend on \ndefense.61 Any fiscal consolidation in the United \nStates \u2013 or a political stand-off relating to debt \nloads \u2013 could have a profound effect on global \nmarkets and trade, while any overestimation of \nthe slowdown could lead to earlier or sharper \nintervention on interest rates and re-spark \ndemand-side price pressures. The outcome of \nthe US presidential elections in November creates \nadditional uncertainty for the country\u2019s economic \noutlook, depending on the policy choices of the \nnext government.62 \nMatthew Henry, \nUnsplash Debt distress\nHigher interest rates amid slowing growth will strain \ndebt loads for the public and private sector alike. \nThe corporate debt default rate remains far lower \nthan peaks hit during the 2008-09 Global Financial \nCrisis ().63 The majority of corporate debt \nis also years from maturity. Less than 14% of S&P \n500 debt is set to mature in the next two years, \nwith nearly half to mature after 2030.64 In essence, \nthe world\u2019s largest companies will be effectively \ninsulated from higher interest rates for more than \nhalf a decade.\nHowever, small and medium-sized companies, that \nform the backbone of many domestic markets, \nwill be particularly sensitive to slowing economic \ngrowth and persistently high interest rates. As \nstruggling companies cut costs, unemployment \nmay rise, reducing consumer spending and creating \na negative feedback loop that can contribute to \na deeper economic downturn. This could also \ncontribute to heightened market concentration, as \nstart-ups struggle and larger, more financially robust \ncorporations consolidate their position, including in \nthe tech sector (Chapter 2.4: AI in charge). \nHeavily indebted countries are also exposed to \nthese economic conditions. The risk of sovereign \ndebt defaults is rising but notably, even with a \nstrong US dollar, larger emerging economies \nsuch as Mexico and Brazil have largely avoided \ndebt distress to date.65 This has been attributed \nto structurally different conditions in these \nmarkets than in the past, including central bank \nindependence and the accumulation of large \nforeign-exchange reserves.66 In other parts of the \nworld, like in Egypt, Ethiopia, Ghana, Lebanon, \nPakistan, and Tunisia, the risks are much higher. \nThe impacts of tighter financial conditions will \nbuild over time, and pressures on fiscal balances \nwill rise.

They are concerned mainly with \nincreasing a community's preparedness to bear \nthe effects of inevitable global risks, but do not \nsignificantly mitigate their impact beyond national \nborders.\nWith looming urgency to adapt to avoid the worst \nimpacts of a changing climate, local measures \npresent a relatively agile response to risk, \nunencumbered by lengthy processes that are \ncommon to global agreements. Measures range \nfrom instigating more resilient building codes \nto making investments in wildfire management, \nflood defenses and heatwave mitigation. \nInfrastructure investment can also enhance a \ncountry\u2019s preparedness to tackle pandemics. \nWhen COVID-19 hit, it was the capacity of national \nhealth systems \u2013 i.e., availability of hospital beds, \nintensive care units and medical personnel \u2013 that \nlargely dictated its local impact. While localized \nstrategies are generally associated with boosting \npreparedness, there are some cases where they \nprevent global risks from materializing altogether. \nLocal compliance with vaccine guidance, for \nexample, can eliminate diseases such as polio.\nThere are several global risk governance \napproaches highlighted within the GRPS that would \nfall under local measures: Public awareness and \neducation, Financial instruments and National \nand local regulations. Public awareness and \neducation initiatives can be effective in reducing the \nimpact of AI-enabled misinformation on local media \nenvironments. While it is difficult for single countries \nto control the diffusion of AI-generated content, \nit is in their power to include AI-literacy in public \neducation systems and to prioritize the issues \nof understanding AI\u2019s capabilities and identifying \ntrustworthy sources of information. Financial \ninstruments \u2013 including insurance, catastrophe \nbonds or public-risk pools \u2013 can alleviate the effects \nof natural disasters and geoeconomic shocks, while \nsocial safety nets and pensions represent important \ntools in managing longer-term risks associated with \ndemographic trends and societal polarization.\nNational and local regulations are identified \nby the majority of GRPS respondents as key for \ndriving action on a number of economic risks \n().

National \ngovernments also have the power to act against \nIllicit economic activity and reduce their countries\u2019 \nvulnerability to organized crime. Protection against \nBiodiversity loss and ecosystem collapse as \nwell as Pollution can also be managed via local or \nnational environmental regulation.\nLocalized strategies can be enacted \nindependently, and thus face fewer hurdles in \nterms of cooperation requirements. However, \nthey are not free from challenges. Investment to \nboost resilience is costly and not all countries or \njurisdictions have the same resources, technology \nand capacity. In an environment of rising costs and \nnarrow approaches to international investment, the \ncapacity and financing for implementing effective \nlocal measures tend to be more concentrated \nin higher-income countries, perpetuating rather \nthan addressing inequality. They may also have \nunintended spillover effects across borders; for \nexample, economic levers to tackle inflation in one \neconomy can lead to debt concerns in another \n(Chapter 1.5: Economic uncertainty).\nThe public and private sectors, alone and in \npartnership, can play a role in scaling local \nresponses, bringing down costs and expanding \nrisk reduction capabilities to all. Businesses are \nkey developers, testers and early adopters of new \ntechnologies, such as foods that rapidly grow in \nextremely adverse environments or AI tools to spot \nnascent wildfires.4 Likewise, governments have the \nability to step in and de-risk investments to help \nclose the gap in economic opportunity and bolster \nresilience (Chapter 2.5: End of development?). \nNovel approaches to ownership of local \ninfrastructure, involving regulator intervention and \ncommunity ownership, can allow projects to become \nmore bankable, feasible and targeted, while local \naction groups can often mobilize effective disaster \nresponse as well as direct funds to prevention.5\nBreakthrough endeavors\n3.2\nIn some cases, the action of an individual or \nentity can be enough to provide a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d \ndevelopment to address risk or to serve as the \npositive tipping point to an alternate \u201csafe state.\u201d \nThese breakthrough endeavors are as equally \nrelevant for preventing or mitigating the likelihood of \nrisk as they are for lessening the impact. \nMany breakthrough endeavors fall under the approach \nof Research & development (R&D), encompassing \nactivities such as medical breakthroughs, new \ntechnologies or a novel approach to quantifying and \ngoverning risk. A prominent example of the latter is the \nformation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange (IPCC) by the United Nations Environment \nProgramme and the World Meteorological Association \nin 1988, endorsed by the UN the same year. There \nare also examples of industrial transformations that \nhave pivoted based on a single idea or action, such as \nthe targeted effort of eliminating chlorofluorocarbons \n(CFCs) to protect the ozone layer, resulting in a \nsignificant impact on a global problem. \nGRPS respondents note that R&D can play a \nkey role in addressing health, environmental \nand technological risks (). During the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, the concentrated efforts of a \nfew pharmaceutical companies made a difference \nfor the global community. Supported by significant \nfunding from governments, their innovations \nto develop a novel vaccine in record time was \ncrucial to lowering death rates, demonstrating \nthe immense potential of scientific breakthroughs \non reducing the impact of health-related risks like \nInfectious diseases.\nZhenyu Luo, Unsplash R&D can boost preparedness for inevitable \nenvironmental risks such as Extreme weather \nevents and Non-weather related natural \ndisasters, as well as allowing us to reduce the \nlikelihood of Critical changes to Earth systems \nand Natural resources shortages. A significant \nleap forward in research leading to viable nuclear \nfusion power generation for example, could \nrepresent a turning point, providing clean energy \nand accelerating the transition to Net Zero, at the \nsame time as reducing the risk of Pollution.6 As \ndiscussed in Chapter 2.3: A 3\u00b0C world, however, \nthe unilateral application of climate mitigation \ntechnologies also carry risks.\nThere are other hurdles to overcome. Despite \npotentially being on the precipice of a \u201cgolden age\u201d \nof scientific discovery, the strategic importance of \nemerging technologies, such as AI and quantum \ncomputing, is resulting in a fragmentation of R&D \ninitiatives, with some opting for political isolationism \nto safeguard technological advancements. The \nformation of a new body equivalent to the IPCC \nto synthesize key perspectives relating to AI risk \nhas been mooted; to be effective, it would need \nto overcome the challenges of ensuring balance \nof representation and of being nimble enough to \naddress rapidly emerging scientific developments. \nAnd while R&D can result in game-changing \nsolutions, the institutions involved often lack the \nfunds or political might needed to translate into \nimpact. With carbon capture and storage (CCS) for \nexample, the sheer scale of the costs associated \nwith deployment act as barriers, alongside limited \nconfidence in the success of the outcomes.\nTechnology is seen as both a source of risk and \nas part of the solution. Adverse outcomes of AI \ntechnologies is viewed as a top risk that can be \naddressed by R&D. However, AI may also prove to \nbe the key to unlocking a multitude of the world\u2019s \nproblems. Recent research, for example, suggests \nthat it could revolutionize materials science, \nallowing us to make leaps forward in terms of \nbatteries, solar panels, computer chips and other \nvital technologies that will be required in efforts to \naddress a multitude of risks.7\nStrengthening global research networks that connect \nresearchers, institutions and industries worldwide can \nfacilitate communication and the sharing of resources. \nPublic-sector support remains crucial. Healthcare \ncompanies alone would not have been able to roll \nout an effective vaccine for COVID-19 in such a short \ntime frame had they not been co-funded, and this \nmodel of governments de-risking liability to fast-track \ndeployment could be extended to other challenges, \npotentially coupled with enhanced conditionalities \n25\n0\n50\n75\n100\nShare of respondents (%)\n81%\n58%\n56%\n55%\n55%\n55%\n51%\n51%\n51%\n49%\nInfectious diseases\nAdverse outcomes \nof frontier technologies\nExtreme weather events\nChronic health conditions\nNon-weather related natural disasters\nCyber insecurity\nAdverse outcomes of AI technologies\nCritical change to Earth systems\nPollution\nNatural resource shortages\nTop global risks addressed by Research and development\n\nSource\nWorld Economic Forum Global Risks \nPerception Survey 2023-2024.\n\"Which approach(es) do you expect to have the most potential for driving action on risk reduction and preparedness over the\nnext 10 years?\"\nRisk categories\nEconomic\nEnvironmental\nGeopolitical\nSocietal\nTechnological\nNote\nRespondents could select up to three responses from the following nine options:  Financial \ninstruments, National and local regulations, Minilateral treaties and agreements, Global treaties and \nagreements, Development assistance, corporate strategies, Research & development, Public \nawareness and education, Multi-stakeholder engagement.\nResearch & development (e.g. new technologies, early-warning systems, global risk research) to ensure returns are more equally shared. Fiscal \nincentives can be deployed to encourage further \ninnovation within the private sector, while acceptance \nof new technologies and approaches would be \nbolstered by governance and oversight. The role of \nphilanthropy, should also not be overlooked as a key \nsource of funding for ambitious projects to eradicate \ndisease and boost climate resilience, for example.8\nPolicy-makers need to adopt a dual vision, \nharnessing the power of innovation to address \npresent challenges, while keeping an eye on the \nfuture. Investing in breakthrough endeavors is often \na long-term bet, involving some degree of risk-taking \nand failure, but coupled with wins that boost our \nability to mitigate or adapt in the face of global risks. \nCollective actions\n3.3\nWhen the sum of individual actions are directed \ntowards a common goal, change can be effected on \na global scale. Collective action is not the result of \ncollaboration, but of the aggregate and independent \neffort of single citizens, companies and countries. \nExamples include expanding the adoption of a \nvegetarian diet or reducing combustion-engine \ncars and air travel to slash carbon emissions. \nThese changes in lifestyle or consumption \npatterns are insignificant when pursued by a single \nindividual. But if a material number of people \ntake such actions concurrently, such aggregate \nefforts have the power to alter market dynamics \nand move the dial on climate-change mitigation. \nThe same is true for business actions. If a critical \nnumber of companies commit to building ethical \nsupply chains, respect for human rights and labour \nstandards will improve worldwide.\nCollective action can also play a role in terms of \npreparing for global risks. Japan\u2019s Community-\nBased Disaster Risk Management9 and \nBangladesh\u2019s Cyclone Preparedness Program10 \nboth demonstrate the power of collective \npreparedness to address inevitable environmental \nrisks and how communities can be mobilized to \nmitigate their impacts.

Likewise, ensuring rapid dissemination of \nofficial cyclone warning signals across communities \nencourages collective preparedness measures to be \nimplemented along Bangladesh\u2019s coast. Technology \ncan act as an enabler for collective action. \nInformation and communication technologies, \nincluding social media, have transformed the speed \nand the way in which information is shared, and \nwhile there are risks associated with this (Chapter \n1.3: False information), there are also benefits in \nterms of mass mobilization for public good.\nThere are several risk governance approaches \nidentified within the GRPS that would fall under \ncollective action: Public awareness and \neducation, Multistakeholder engagement, and \nCorporate strategies. Public awareness and \neducation campaigns amplify (grassroot) initiatives \nthat have yet to reach a critical mass in order to \nmake an impact. In some cases, governments have \nestablished specific units to effect change through \nencouraging collective behaviours, such as those \nto prevent the spread of disease.11 Multistakeholder \nengagement platforms favour knowledge and best \npractice sharing to support and guide individual \nefforts towards a common goal.\nGRPS respondents recognize Corporate strategies \nas having the most potential to reduce economic \nrisks relating to financial and labour markets (Figure \n3.3). If companies adopt responsible business \npractices and investment decisions, they will reap \nreputational and performance benefits12 while making \nthe wider economic and financial system more \nresilient and prepared to face the risk of Economic \ndownturn. Businesses can also contribute to \nshoring up the labour market, both locally and \nglobally, by addressing Labour shortages and \nUnemployment risks through investing in skills \ndevelopment, upholding workers\u2019 rights and granting \ncontract security.\nIn order for collective action to be sufficiently \neffective, there must be some degree of consensus \non the nature and urgency of the risk, the type \nof action required to address it and the intended \noutcome. This is no small feat in a world increasingly \nsubject to societal polarization and where short-term \ncost-of-living pressures continue to bite.\nIt is crucial therefore to build platforms that \nset standards and favour knowledge-sharing, \nchanneling individual efforts towards a common \ngoal. Tax incentives can strengthen collective action \nby business and individuals. Policy-makers can also \nstrengthen regulation on environmental, social and \ncorporate governance (ESG) reporting to ensure \ntransparency on corporate social responsibility \nstrategies. This contributes to creating a positive \ncycle where investors can recognize and reward \nthe businesses that act, which in turns incentivizes \nmore and more companies to align.\nCross-border coordination\n3.4\nCooperation may be constrained in an increasingly \nfragmented world, but it remains imperative to solve \nthe biggest, most existential risks. Cross-border \ncoordination for risk reduction takes many forms \nand is typically centred on mitigating likelihood. It \nranges from mutual restraint (agreement between \ntwo or more parties that possess dangerous \ncapabilities to refrain from using them), to \naddressing the weakest link in a system (enforcing \ncommitment to minimum standards and guardrails \nor by investing in a country that has the potential \nto destabilize others), to international agreements \n(such as those that aim to limit global warming, \nmaintain security and ensure free trade).\nOCG Saving the Ocean, \nUnsplash Pressing risks requiring mutual restraint often \ninvolve the proliferation and malign use of \nadvanced and potentially destructive technologies. \nRestraining the use of weapons of mass destruction \nor restricting the incorporation of AI into lethal \nweapons and nuclear decision-making systems \nare needed to avoid the risk of inadvertent conflict \nescalation (Chapter 2.4: AI in charge). \nWhen it comes to global risks such as terrorism \nor pandemic outbreaks, it is often the weakest \nlink that dictates the risk. Technological advances \nin AI mean that bio-engineered pathogens have \nbecome a reality, and a security breach of a high-\ncontainment bio-laboratory or bio-foundry, for \nexample, is a global concern.\nGRPS respondents highlight Minilateral treaties \nand agreements and Global treaties and \nagreements as risk governance approaches \nwithin the category of cross-border coordination. \nMinilateral treaties \u2013 or agreements involving a \nsmaller number of parties and often backed by \nregional financing \u2013 represent a feasible solution \nto many global risks faced by a fragmented world, \nwhere it is difficult to have a large number of \ncountries endorsing the same cause.\nGlobal treaties and agreements, the result of \nconstructive dialogue, negotiation and compromise, \nare fundamental to mitigating and preparing for \nmany global risks. They enable involved parties to \nidentify common ground and cooperate towards \nshared objectives. GRPS respondents recognize \nsuch treaties as the most appropriate lever to \nmanage key geopolitical risks such as Interstate \narmed conflict; Geoeconomic confrontation; and \nBiological, chemical or nuclear hazards; as well \nas inherently globalized environmental risks such as \nCritical changes to Earth systems ().\nAmid growing geopolitical rifts, global treaties and \nagreements face numerous challenges. Agreements \nregarding global trade and financial integration are \nunder pressure from trade conflicts between China \nand the United States, Brexit and national post-\nCOVID-19 economic recovery efforts. While there \nis emerging consensus on the need for a universal \nregulatory framework for AI to address concerns \nsurrounding ethical standards, data privacy and \npotential misuse, the first steps in this arena seem \nto be faltering, with the EU\u2019s landmark AI Act \ncoming under pressure from governments13 and \ntechnology companies14 alike.

Minilateral treaties and agreements may \nbe increasingly appropriate to resolve conflict and \nensure economic prosperity at a regional level; but \nthey are unlikely to replace wider agreements in \nmaintaining global security.\nProgress has been made through international \ncollaboration in addressing climate change; but \naction needs to be deepened, widened and, most \ncrucially, sped up. National representatives that \nattended the 2023 United Nations Climate Change \nConference (COP28) approved for the first time a \nroadmap for \u201ctransitioning away from fossil fuels\u201d \n\u2013 but the deal stopped short of a long-demanded \ncall for a \u201cphaseout\u201d of oil, coal and gas.15 \u201cClimate \nClubs\u201d, or coalitions of the willing,16 represent a \npractical path for progress given the challenges \nof traditional multilateralism. These coalitions of \ncountries commit to ambitious climate goals and \nadopt measures to enforce compliance, while \noffering incentives for membership.\nWhen it comes to security, much momentum is \nwith the private sector, where applications with \ndual use potential are being developed.17 As \ntechnology evolves faster than regulation, private \nproducers must take responsibility to not only be \ntransparent, but to show restraint when releasing \nnew frontier models.\nConclusion\n3.5\nThe world is undergoing multiple long-term \nstructural transformations: the rise of AI, climate \nchange, a shift in the geopolitical distribution \nof power, and demographic transitions. These \nstructural forces are global, pervasive and charged \nwith momentum. Against this backdrop, known \nand newly emerging risks need preparation and \nmitigation (see  for the full picture of \nGRPS responses regarding drivers of risk reduction \nand preparedness). \nLocalized strategies, breakthrough endeavours, \ncollective actions and cross-border coordination all \nplay a part in addressing these risks.  \nLocalized strategies, leveraging investment and \nregulation, are critical for reducing the impact \nof global risks, and both the public and private \nsector can play a key role in extending benefits \nto all. Through prioritizing the future and focusing \non breakthrough research and development, the \nefforts of single entities can make the world a safer \nplace. The actions of individual citizens, companies \nand countries \u2013 while perhaps insignificant on their \nown \u2013 can move the needle on global risk reduction \nif they reach a critical mass. Finally, cross-border \ncoordination remains the only viable pathway for the \nmost critical risks to human security and prosperity. \nMarkus Spiske, Unsplash\nGlobal Risks Report 2024"}
