respondents from five of the seven \nindustry groups perceive that the magnitude and severity of \nrisks in the overall environment affecting their organization \nwill decrease in 2024 from the 2023 levels, with six industry \ngroups indicating that they will be above 2022 levels. When \ncomparing the number of risks appearing in both the 2024 \nand 2023 surveys that are rated at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d \nlevel, there is a noticeable decrease in the collective \nnumber of risks at that level across all industries for 2024 \ncompared to 2023. For 2024, three macroeconomic risks \nare rated by one or more industries at the \u201cSignificant \nImpact\u201d level, compared to six macroeconomic risks at \nthat level for 2023. For strategic risks, the decrease in \nthe number of risks rated at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level \ndropped from five in 2023 to one in 2024. The decrease in \nnumber of \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d risks for operational risks is \nfrom 10 in 2023 to four 2024 risks.\nRespondents in the Healthcare industry group rate the \nmost risks at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level, with seven \nfor 2024. Four of their seven highest-rated risks are \noperational in nature, with concerns related to cyber \nthreats, data privacy, third-party risks and talent shortages \n(most likely clinical healthcare workers, particularly \nnurses). Financial services respondents rate four of the 36 \nrisks at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level, with two of those four \nrelating to overall economic conditions and the current \ninterest rate environment (both macroeconomic issues), \none related to heightened regulatory scrutiny, and one \nrelated to cyber threats. Only two other industry groups \nrate at least one risk at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level. The \nConsumer Products and Services industry group rates the \nmacroeconomic risk related to economic conditions and \ninflationary pressures at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level and \nthe Technology, Media and Telecommunications industry \ngroup rates cyber threats at that level of significance.\nThree of the seven industry groups rate cyber threats as a \n\u201cSignificant Impact\u201d risk: Financial Services; Technology, Media \nand Telecommunications; and Healthcare. The Financial \nServices, Consumer Products and Services, and Healthcare \nindustry groups are all concerned about economic conditions, \nincluding inflationary pressures. Financial Services and \nHealthcare are the two industry groups also most concerned \nabout heightened regulatory scrutiny.\nWith the continuing transitions happening in energy \ngeneration, it is not surprising that Energy and Utilities \nrespondents believe that 2024 will be riskier than 2023, even \nthough none of the 36 risks they rate is at the \u201cSignificant \nImpact\u201d level. In addition, Energy and Utilities respondents \nrate 10 of the 36 risks as \u201cLess Significant Impact\u201d (4.50 or \nlower), more than any other industry group.\nAll industry groups rate cyber threats as a top five risk \nconcern, suggesting no industry is immune to those \nexposures. All industry groups, except Energy and Utilities \nand Government, include concerns about economic \nconditions, including inflationary pressures, as a top five \nrisk concern. And all industry groups, except Financial \nServices, highlight concerns about the ability to attract, \ndevelop and retain talent as a top five risk concern for \n2024. Increases in labor costs are of particular concern \nfor Healthcare, Consumer Products and Services, and \nGovernment for 2024.\n2034 risk issues\nThe significance of risk concerns a decade out is noticeably \nhigher than short-term risk concerns. For five of the seven \nindustry groups, all of the top five risks for 2034 are at \nthe \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level. This is in contrast to 2024, \nwhere only one industry group (Healthcare) rated all top \nfive risks at that level. The Healthcare industry group rates \none of its risks at noticeably high levels (exceeding 7.0) for \n2034. It also rates the long-term outlook as higher than \nhow it viewed the 10-year outlook last year, suggesting its \nlong-term risk perceptions have elevated from last year. \nGovernment entities also view long-term risks as more \nsignificant than their view of those risks last year, with four \nof their top five risks rated higher for 2034 than 2033.\n93\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive

This journey began just as financial markets around \nthe world were starting their long, slow recovery from \nthe global financial crisis, and has since covered the worst \nglobal pandemic in 100 years as well as near record-low \ninterest rates followed shortly by the fastest rate hiking \ncycle in history. \nIn this context, getting the first look at each year\u2019s survey \nresults and comparing them to the prior year\u2019s is always \ninteresting \u2014 but the most compelling years to analyze are \nthose in which the market breaks from recent trends and \ngives us some new risks to talk about. It\u2019s safe to say that \n2024 is one of those years.\nOur observations\nExecutives have arrived at a pessimistic consensus. Our \n2023 survey results reflected a deep sense of uncertainty \nand ambiguity, with many executives concerned that a \nrecession was imminent even as they struggled to attract \nand retain staff in a red-hot job market. We commented in \nour 2023 report that we were surprised that the risk tied \nto economic conditions and inflation dropped from second \nplace in 2022 to third in 2023, as we saw financial markets \nfacing increasing headwinds. Fast-forwarding to the results \nfor 2024, the liquidity crisis and resulting bank failures in \nearly 2023, a tougher regulatory environment and push \nto raise capital, higher funding costs, and expectations \nof having to manage the business in a \u201chigher for longer\u201d \ninterest rate environment have collectively convinced \nfinancial services leaders that the industry is indeed in a \ntougher economic cycle. Interestingly though, concerns \nabout access to capital and liquidity only ranked 16th on \nthe list of top risks, up slightly from 20th place last year. \nThis suggests our respondents are more concerned about \nthe impact that current market conditions are having on \ntheir profitability and growth prospects than as a threat to \ntheir survival. \nPartially as a result, the war for talent is abating. In last \nyear\u2019s survey summary, we predicted that concerns about \ntalent would diminish by the time of our 2024 survey and \nthat turned out to be an accurate forecast. Considering the \neconomic challenges above, financial institutions have cut \nspending significantly and many have put hiring freezes \nin place. While there is still significant competition for \ntalent in pockets \u2014 notably in data, AI/machine learning, \nand regulatory compliance \u2014 overall, voluntary attrition \nrates in the United States have come down significantly \naccording to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics,6 and \ncompensation expectations are normalizing. As a result, \nconcerns about attracting and retaining talent saw a big drop \nin this year\u2019s survey results, from second to sixth place.\nThe liquidity crisis and resulting bank \nfailures in early 2023, a tougher \nregulatory environment and push to \nraise capital, higher funding costs, and \nexpectations of having to manage the \nbusiness in a \u201chigher for longer\u201d interest \nrate environment have collectively \nconvinced financial services leaders \nthat the industry is indeed in a tougher \neconomic cycle.\n6\t \u201cJob Openings and Labor Turnover \u2014 September 2023,\u201d News release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, November 1, 2023: www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf.\n101\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later In general, financial services leaders feel we are in a riskier \ntime. In addition to the risk ranking order, it\u2019s also instructive \nto look at the average scores assigned to the top risks and \nhow those have changed year over year. We look at this as our \nsurvey\u2019s version of a VIX score or \u201cfear gauge.\u201d In 2023, the top \nrisk (change in interest rate environment) received an average \n5.94 score on our 10-point scale. In 2024, interest rates \nremained the top risk but the score for that factor increased to \n6.36. The average score of the top five risks as a group in 2024 \nrose to 6.13 from 5.76 in 2023. Maybe most notably, the top \nfour risks in 2024 all earned a higher score than the top risk in \n2023 did. In other words, although several of the top concerns \nfrom last year remain near the top of the list this year, the level \nof concern has gone up across the board.\nUnsurprisingly, cyber risks took a big jump \u2014 and are likely \nto grow further. Last year, we were surprised that cyber \nthreats only ranked as the 11th highest risk, particularly \nas this was the top risk for 2022. For 2024, this trend has \nreversed and cyber risk has moved back into the top five. \nNotably, our 2024 results were collected before the high \nprofile ICBC ransomware incident occurred in November, \nwhich is causing financial institutions around the world to \nreevaluate both their own cyber risk management controls \nas well as how they would address threats that impact their \ncritical counterparties. As a result, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised \nto see this risk move even higher on the list for 2025.\nAn increasingly complex third-party risk landscape drove \nthat item up the list. Third-party risk took the largest leap \nof all items on our list in 2024, rising 11 spots to fifth. We \nbelieve there are multiple factors behind this, including:\n\t\u2022 Growing concerns about counterparty credit risk and \nfinancial stability driven by the economic conditions \ndescribed above;\n\t\u2022 An ever-larger list of security breaches caused by third-\nparty vendors and/or technology platforms they provide;\n\t\u2022 Growing reliance on cloud and software-as-a-service \nproviders across the financial services industry; and\n\t\u2022 Increasing regulatory scrutiny related to third-party \npartnerships, particularly at the intersection of banking \nand fintech where banking regulators have criticized \ninsured depository institutions serving as a conduit for \nless regulated fintechs without appropriate review and \noversight of their activities by the bank.\nWhile concerns about the economy and the regulatory \nresponse dominate the top of the list, technological \ninnovation and related infrastructure needs follow closely \nbehind. \u201cExisting operations and legacy IT infrastructure \nunable to meet performance expectations as well as \u2018born \ndigital\u2019 competitors,\u201d \u201cadoption of digital technologies \nrequiring new skills in short supply,\u201d and \u201cinability to utilize \nrigorous data analytics to achieve market intelligence and \nincrease productivity and efficiency\u201d all appear among \nthe top 10 risks for the third year in a row. This presents a \ncritical strategic challenge as financial institutions attempt \nto cut expenses aggressively even as the cost of technology \nmodernization efforts continues to rise \u2014 and executives \nrecognize that the only thing worse than incurring these \ncosts is not making the investment and falling further \nbehind more innovative competitors. This dynamic will put \nsignificant pressure to cut costs even further in other areas \nas technology consumes an ever-greater share of operating \nexpenses in the financial services industry.\nLooking ahead to 2034\nFor the past few annual surveys, we\u2019ve also asked \nrespondents about the top risks they expect to face 10 \nyears in the future. For our respondents, the 2034 view \ngenerally mirrors the decade-out results we received last \nyear, with a few exceptions that seem to be colored by a \nfocus on 2024\u2019s top risks.\nConsistent with our prior year results, concerns about \nkeeping up with the threat of digital disruption continue \nto dominate the longer-term view. Cyber threats jumped \nand worries about attracting talent dipped a bit, which is \nconsistent with the trend described above regarding 2023 \nvs. 2024 results.\n102\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later Other noteworthy results in the 2034 review:\n\t\u2022 Regulatory scrutiny remains high on the list both in the \ncurrent and 10 years\u2019 out view, and this has been the \ncase for as long as we have conducted this survey. This is \ninteresting given the exciting innovations coming online \nfor compliance functions, particularly involving data \nanalytics and generative AI. We think these will become \ntruly groundbreaking advancements that will finally \nallow financial institutions to get ahead of regulatory \nexpectations in key areas like financial crimes while \nbending the cost curve down over time. Is the market \nmore pessimistic than we are about the opportunities \nthat exist in this area, or does it simply believe that \nlawmakers and regulatory agencies will continue to \nmove the bar just out of reach? \n\t\u2022 \u201cChange in current interest rate environment\u201d jumped \nfrom 14th on last year\u2019s 10-year outlook list to seventh \nin 2034. Is this just recency bias given the impact \nthe rate environment has had in 2022 and 2023, or \ndo our respondents think that rate trends will move \nhigher in the foreseeable future? What we also found \ninteresting is that historically, moderately higher rates \nare good for financial institutions\u2019 margins \u2014 with \nmost of the current stress being caused by short-term \nfunding costs increasing while the value of long-dated \nassets has fallen. This is a temporary problem that will \ndiminish as longer-term assets that were priced during \ntimes of record-low rates run off. Perhaps concerns \nthat higher-for-longer interest rates will constrain \nfunding demands and deal flow are outweighing the \nmargin upside that this scenario would represent for \nour respondents.\n\t\u2022 Finally, there are a few 2034 risks that fell closer to the \nbottom of the list than we would have expected:\n\t\u2013 \u201cGeopolitical shifts, regional conflicts and instability \nin governmental regimes or expansion of global \nterrorism\u201d moved up five spots from last year but \nis still only in 25th place, and \u201cchanges in global \nmarkets and trade policies\u201d held steady at 33rd \nplace, making it the fourth lowest-rated risk. These \nresults are surprising in light of growing geopolitical \nconflicts from the Russian/Ukraine war, regional \ntensions in the Pacific, and renewed fighting \nbetween Israeli and Palestinians and heightened risk \nof broader conflicts in the Middle East as a result. \nOf note, we did see a notable increase in risk ratings \nprovided by respondents who completed our survey \nafter the October 7, 2023, events in the Middle East.\n\t\u2013 \u201cFormulating business response to legal, political \nand social issues that are polarizing\u201d was a new \naddition to our survey this year but only came in at \n29th place. Likewise, \u201cimpact of social issues and \nDEI priorities on ability to attract/retain talent and \ncompete\u201d actually dropped from 24th to 30th place \nthis year. Given that both issues have continued \nto consume a greater share of business leaders\u2019 \nattention as well as media scrutiny regarding their \ncompanies over the past year, it\u2019s interesting that \nour respondents think they will be so much less \nsignificant as concerns a decade out. \n\t\u2013 Lastly, \u201cmanaging demands on or expectations of \nworkforce to work remotely or as part of a hybrid \nwork environment\u201d dropped nine spots from 22nd \nto 31st place. While we\u2019ve certainly seen progress \nover the past 12 months in financial institutions \nbringing a larger share of their workforces back into \nthe office, overall attendance rates vary significantly \nby geography and many financial institutions have \ntold us that they are still not consistently where they \nwould like to be in this regard. Our survey results \nsuggest the market believes these challenges will \nbe fully resolved, though, and that a significant \npercentage of remote or hybrid work is not part of \nthe long-term future of financial services.\nRegulatory scrutiny remains high on the \nlist both in the current and 10 years\u2019 out \nview, and this has been the case for as \nlong as we have conducted this survey. \nThis is interesting given the exciting \ninnovations coming online for compliance \nfunctions, particularly involving data \nanalytics and generative AI.\n103\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later FIGURE 22A\nConsumer Products and Services \u2014 2024\nFIGURE 22B\nConsumer Products and Services \u2014 2034\n*\t This data was reported as 2032 and 2031 results, respectively, in our prior year reports.

Inflationary \npressure, workforce attrition with talent gaps and \nprotecting customers\u2019 data are top on the list of major \nconcerns weighing on the minds of senior executives in the \nconsumer packaged goods (CPG) and retail industry group. \nSeparately, for hospitality and airlines companies, cyber \nthreats, the rising threat of catastrophic natural disasters, \nand geopolitical shifts and regional conflicts are cited \namong these industries\u2019 top risks.\nIn Protiviti\u2019s latest Top Risks Survey, CPG and retail \nexecutives were asked to provide their perspectives \non the biggest risks facing their organizations over the \nnext 12 months and a decade ahead. Their views reflect \na growing sense of uncertainty in today\u2019s business \nenvironment, where market competition remains \nfierce, the costs of goods and labor continue to rise, and \ncompanies are desperate for new technologies to better \nmanage risks and improve customer experience.\nEven as supply challenges have normalized, the difficult \nmacroeconomic environment has made it challenging for \nCPG and retail companies to forecast future demand and \nmake growth plans. Industry leaders are exploring ways to \nretain and grow their customer base with customer loyalty \nprograms and new payment strategies for shoppers.\nBut how can you pass on the high cost related to inflation \nand supply chain disruptions to customers without hurting \ncustomer satisfaction and loyalty? How do you retain your \ntop talent and keep a lid on rising labor costs? These are \ntough questions that business leaders must tackle head on, \nand they can only do this effectively with access to data \nanalytics and market intelligence, which consequently, is \nidentified as the ninth-rated risk for 2024 by CPG and retail \nexecutives who responded to the survey.\nBelow we discuss other top risks identified by CPG and \nretail respondents.\nThe difficult macroeconomic \nenvironment has made it challenging for \nCPG and retail companies to forecast \nfuture demand and make growth plans.\n\nMacroeconomic and labor market challenges\nFew industries have been more impacted by inflation than \nthe CPG industry so it is no surprise that executives cited \neconomic challenges, including inflation, as their No. 1 risk \nfor 2024, with workforce-related challenges coming in at \nsecond place. \nA change in the interest rate environment is another source \nof concern. Since 2022, the Federal Reserve\u2019s campaign \nto fight inflation by increasing interest rates has hurt \ncompanies\u2019 ability to borrow and grow. Although rate \nincreases have slowed this year, business leaders fear the \nFed might not reverse course next year if inflation remains \nhigh. CPG and retail respondents cited the interest rate \nissue as the No. 7 risk for 2024. \nOn the labor front, the CPG and retail industry are \nexperiencing a perfect storm as workers leave in search of \na better work-life balance, greater incentives (salary and \nbenefits), flexibility, and a working environment that better \nsupports their mental health and overall well-being. The \nlabor issues and economic fears are clearly interconnected. \nIn the United States, the CPG industry provides 2.3 million \njobs and the retail industry, the largest private-sector \nemployer in the U.S., supports 52 million jobs. Although the \nlabor market has remained resilient, job growth is expected \nto decelerate in the coming months in lockstep with slower \n105\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later economic activity and the prospect of restrictive credit \nconditions, according to the National Retail Federation.\nTo address the workforce challenges and transform their \nrelationship with employees, retail business leaders must \ndevelop a deeper understanding of the labor dynamic \nand the forces driving changes across the industry. The \nconversation should begin in the boardrooms and executive \nsuites, starting with these prompting questions: What do \nfrontline employees and managers want in a job? What will \nmotivate them to show up every day?\nThe customer should be front and center in the inflation \ndiscussion. In particular, as household debt, especially \ncredit card debt, hits an all-time high, brands and retailers \nneed to consider the impact of a stressed consumer and \nhigher interest rates on consumer behavior. They also need \nto consider which parts of their customer base are more \nand less impacted by inflation, so they can adjust their \nmarketing and advertising strategies accordingly.\nCost optimization through automation and technology \nmodernization\nThe economic uncertainty and inflationary pressures are \nalso forcing CPG and retail companies to explore different \nways to cut costs. It\u2019s a sink-or-swim situation for many, \nespecially smaller companies that have limited purchasing \npower and ability to negotiate lower cost with suppliers. \nWith margins compressing, companies are reassessing \nworking capital and cash flow management, reducing \ninventory in warehouses and negotiating pricing with \nsuppliers, among other cost optimization measures. \nVisibility and transparency into data are crucial for making \ninformed cost-cutting decisions, and so companies also are \ninvesting time and resources into automation to improve \noperational efficiencies and data analytics to gain better \nvisibility into all aspects of operations.\nAI and other technology tools are \nbecoming increasingly important as \ncompanies consider running their \nbusinesses with fewer people.\nLegacy systems, however, are proving to be a challenge; \nautomation is easier for current technologies, but \nmore difficult for legacy ones. As a result, the retail \nand CPG executives who participated in the survey \nsaid they are particularly concerned about the inability \nof existing operations and legacy IT infrastructure to \nmeet performance expectations as well as \u201cborn digital\u201d \ncompetitors. This concern was ranked fifth among the 2024 \ntop risk issues.\nAdditionally, the respondents said they are worried \nabout the ability of their organizations to adopt digital \ntechnologies given the shortage in technical staff (ranked \n10th for 2024). Despite these concerns, some retail and \nCPG companies are being aggressive in adopting new \ntechnologies. A separate survey conducted by Protiviti \nrecently found that more than half of financial executives \nin the retail and CPG industry are already deploying \ngenerative AI to predict consumer behaviors, suggest \ntimely product recommendations, optimize pricing, \nmitigate fraud and manage inventory.\nAI technologies are becoming increasingly important as \ncompanies seek to stay ahead of the competition, run \ntheir businesses with fewer people and enhance customer \nexperience. The challenge for some companies will be finding \nthe most efficient way to integrate these technologies into \nexisting legacy systems without hurting productivity or \nintroducing new risks, such as cyber attacks.\nCybersecurity and data privacy expectations\nEnsuring privacy and compliance with growing identity \nprotection expectations has become a C-suite priority in \ntoday\u2019s omnichannel environment. Previously, companies \nrelied on third parties to collect and sell consumer data, \nbut now they are keeping it in-house. This shift in data \nownership requires them to prioritize data protection.\n106\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later At the same time, as more retail and CPG companies \ntransform digitally, the threat of cyber intrusion or \noperational failures that result in data exposures has risen \ndramatically. Recent industry-related cyber attacks have \nincluded digital disruptions to production lines and supply \nchains. The concerns about cybersecurity are evident from \nthe recent SEC guidance on cybersecurity disclosures, \nwhich focus on protecting information and assessing its \nimpact on organizations.\nAs cyberattacks continue to increase in severity, CPG \nand retail organizations need to prioritize protection and \ncompliance. It also means paying attention to third-party \nrisks, which could emanate from IT vendors and/or supply \nchain partners. Organizations that fail to prioritize these \nissues face executive fallout and brand reputation risk.\nSustaining customer loyalty\nThe future of customer loyalty and buying patterns remains \nuncertain. Consequently, CPG and retail respondents \nrated sustaining customer loyalty and retention as the \nsixth-ranked risk for 2024. The abundance of options and \nchannels to connect with consumers is among the reasons \nwhy companies find it harder to maintain customer loyalty. \nLoyalty between brands and consumers is being tested as \nmergers and acquisitions disrupt the marketplace.\nStill, customer experience needs to be a focal point and \nan important battleground for brands to consider. Great \nproducts and services are no longer enough; the consumer\u2019s \nexperience with purchasing and utilizing the product or \nservice has to be a priority as well. Brands should make \ndecisions with the mindset that they cannot prioritize their \nown interests over customer satisfaction.\nThe big picture: Looking a decade ahead\nDue to the current challenging business environment, \nmany CPG and retail organizations are primarily focused \non maintenance work rather than funding transformational \nprograms. This lack of forward investment and focus on \nroutine operations are likely to continue until there is more \nclarity and confidence in the business environment. \nLike in previous years, CPG and retail respondents were \nasked to look into their crystal ball and identify risk issues \nthey expect over the next decade. The ability to attract, \ndevelop and retain top talent, manage shifts in labor \nexpectations, and address succession challenges came in at \nNo. 1, followed by the rapid speed of disruptive innovations, \nand sustaining customer loyalty and retention.\nCustomer experience needs to be a \nfocal point, and brands should make \ndecisions with the mindset of improving \nthe customer experience continuously.\nHospitality Industry\nThe industry is slated to record its best year ever in 2023, \na reflection of its resilience in the face of major headwinds \nand years of setbacks. Still, industry leaders are concerned \nabout several major risks heading into the new year, \nincluding a potential return of effects of the pandemic.\nCyber threats is top on the list of risks for hospitality \nexecutives. This is no surprise. In recent months, there has \nbeen a rise in reported cyberattacks using malware in the \ngaming industry. The liability exposure and reputational risk \nhere are significant because the gaming industry collects a \nvast amount of personal data and preference information \nfrom its guests, making it a prime target for cyberattacks.\nIn addition to the cyber threats, the hospitality respondents \nidentified the rising threat of catastrophic natural disasters \nand pandemic-related government policies and regulations \nas their top three risks for 2024. Rising labor costs and \nadoption of digital technologies requiring new skills round \nout the top five.\n107\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later In recent years, the lodging industry (e.g., hotels, motels, \nresorts, timeshares) has been focused on updating \ntheir technology infrastructure, especially guest-facing \ntechnology, which is important for enhancing guest \nexperiences and streamlining processes. Interactive \ngaming and online gaming providers are also driving the \ndevelopment of new systems and infrastructure.\nClearly, the industry is still mindful of the impact of the \npandemic and its lingering effects. The cruise line segment, \nfor example, experienced significant losses during the \npandemic and is now navigating the uncertainties of \npotential future disruptions. Given the pandemic experience, \nit makes sense that executives fear that a turn of events, such \nas a COVID variant or a decline in consumer confidence, \ncould have a material impact on the industry\u2019s recovery.\nThe worry over natural disasters makes sense given the \nlocation of properties and the fact that safety and security \nof guests and employees is always a top priority for the \nindustry. It may also be related to increased focus on \nESG, and consumer expectations around the \u201cE\u201d in ESG or \nenvironmental responsibilities.\nThe high labor cost is both a reflection of inflation and \nthe effects of the exodus of workers in the wake of the \npandemic. According to the Journal of Hospitality and \nTourism Management, the hospitality industry lost more \nthan 8.2 million jobs between February and April of 2020, \nmaking it the hardest-hit industry in the United States.\nAirline Industry\nAirline executives cited increased labor costs, geopolitical \nshifts and regional conflicts, and economic conditions, \nincluding inflation, as their top 3 risks issues for 2024. Like \nhospitality, the airline industry is expected to return to \nprofitability this year after several years of disappointing \nfinancial performance.\nBut even with the strong recovery, the industry is keeping \na close eye on the macroeconomic picture, which continues \nto create a lot of uncertainty. For the industry, higher costs \nrelating to energy prices and labor, and an escalation in \ngeopolitical events, are big risks that could reverse the \nalready fragile gains made toward profitability.\n108\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later FIGURE 23A\nManufacturing and Distribution \u2014 2024\nFIGURE 23B\nManufacturing and Distribution \u2014 2034\n*\t This data was reported as 2032 and 2031 results, respectively, in our prior year reports.

The risks these organizations \nface, both short- and long-term in nature, represent a \ncomplex array of external and internal factors ranging \nfrom talent management, cyber threats and supply chain \ndynamics to economic and inflationary concerns, regulatory \nchanges and scrutiny, and technological advancements.\nOverview of top risk issues in 2024\nFor the coming year, economic conditions, including \ninflationary pressures, represent the most significant risk \nfor manufacturing and distribution organizations. Despite \npositive trends in demand and production over the past \nseveral months, the looming specter of inflation remains \na concern amid broader global uncertainty. Of note, the \nManufacturing Purchasing Managers\u2019 Index (PMI) has been \nshowing an uptick in recent months, indicating a positive \ntrajectory, but the industry understandably remains \ncautious. Notably, this concern is expected to decrease \nin significance over the next decade, dropping to the fifth \nposition in terms of long-term risks for 2034.\nA growing number of bad attackers see \nmanufacturing OT environments as \nopportunities to execute ransomware \nattacks on these organizations, increasing \ntheir cyber risk profiles even more. \nThe challenge of attracting, developing and retaining top \ntalent remains high on the list of risks manufacturing and \ndistribution organizations face \u2014 an ongoing situation \ncompounded by shifts in expectations among workers as well \nas succession challenges. Skills shortages continue to fuel \nlow unemployment rates (in the range of 3%) throughout the \nindustry. Specific manufacturing-heavy regions also continue \nto experience scarce talent availability \u2014 a persistent issue \nfor organizations that have locations in more non-urban \nareas, making it difficult to compete with job opportunities in \nmore popular urban areas.\nIn a related finding, rising labor costs appear to be of less \nconcern, having dropped in importance on the list of top \nrisks for the industry group. Further, the decline is more \npronounced than in other survey results, indicating a shift \nin the industry\u2019s focus from labor cost concerns to broader \nchallenges such as talent management, cybersecurity and \nsupply chain resilience.\nSimilar to most other industries, cyber threats have \nresurfaced as a top concern for manufacturing and \ndistribution organizations, likely due to perceived \nvulnerabilities in operational technology (OT) systems \nas well as the proliferation of IoT-connected devices \nand technologies within industrial environments. \nManufacturers historically have not been viewed as prime \ntargets for cyber attacks. Consequently, vulnerability \nmanagement has not been a focus in the same way that \nit has for organizations in other industries (for example, \nfinancial services and retail). However, a growing number \nof bad actors see manufacturing environments as \nopportunities to execute ransomware attacks because \nthey can be deployed in industrial environments that tend \nto be older and run on limited hardware that lacks readily \navailable protections, such as anti-malware, anti-virus \nand on-device monitoring solutions. This increases the \nindustry\u2019s cyber risk profiles even more.\nAdditionally, manufacturers that produce IoT-connected \ngoods must ensure the security of their products to their \nmarkets to minimize brand and reputation risk of a breach.\n110\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later Another key point: New SEC-required cyber disclosures \nhave elevated the importance of cybersecurity for publicly \nheld companies in the industry, bringing added attention to \nthe potential disruption of production processes. \nConcerning supply chain risks, the uncertainty surrounding \nthe core supply chain ecosystem has shifted from being \nthe top concern in recent years to the fourth position \nfor 2024. Factors contributing to this change include \nthe industry\u2019s recovery from severe pandemic-related \nsupply chain disruptions, significantly lower shipping \ncosts globally relative to the height of the pandemic, and \ngreater investments in building supply chain resiliency and \ninnovation. These are positive outcomes based on lessons \nlearned in the pandemic era. Despite the moderation in \nperceived risk level, however, supply chain dynamics remain \na significant risk, and organizations must continue to adapt \nto ongoing challenges, especially as the global business and \ngeopolitical landscape continues to shift.\nThe manufacturing and distribution industry also faces \nheightened regulatory changes and scrutiny (the fifth-\nranked risk issue for 2024), with increased focus on \nESG regulations and disclosure requirements, including \ncybersecurity, as noted earlier. Among the more notable \nnew ESG requirements is the Corporate Sustainability \nReporting Directive, which requires new, standardized and \ndetailed sustainability reporting by companies operating \nin the European Union. This shift aligns with global trends \nand expectations for companies to operate sustainably and \ntransparently. Among the challenges for manufacturing \nand distribution organizations is navigating these complex \nregulatory landscapes while maintaining operational \nefficiency.\nThough not in the top five for the Manufacturing and \nDistribution industry group, other risk issues that landed \nin the top 10 are worth noting. An inability to leverage \nrigorous data analytics for market intelligence and \nincreased productivity ranks sixth. This is understandable \nconsidering that many organizations in the industry group \nmust manage disaggregated and decentralized data sets, \nalong with older, legacy technology systems (making \ntechnical debt another challenge). As a result, extracting \nvaluable, meaningful insights from this data presents a \nsignificant hurdle. \nAnother notable risk issue for 2024 is the adoption of \ndigital technologies requiring new skills that are in short \nsupply. This risk presents challenges on several fronts. New \ntechnologies have brought about transformative benefits \nfor manufacturing and distribution companies in terms of \noperational efficiency and financial performance. However, \nthis paradigm shift also necessitates unique skillsets that, \nas noted earlier, are in short supply. This challenge is \nparticularly acute for these companies because, on average, \nthey tend to lag behind other sectors in the adoption of new \ntechnologies and innovations. In addition, as manufacturing \nand distribution organizations seek to expand their digital \ntransformation efforts, they must navigate an increasingly \ncomplex ecosystem of partners. Moving to cloud-based \nsolutions and integrating more technology into operations \nprompts greater reliance on third parties. While these \nchanges bring strategic advantages, they also call for \ncomprehensive risk management. \nGeopolitical risks are another pressing concern. Current \nglobal events are exacerbating geopolitical uncertainties \nwith regional conflicts and instability in governmental \nregimes or expansion of global terrorism complicating \nthe risk landscape for manufacturing and distribution \norganizations with international operations. The \ninterconnected nature of their supply chains means that \npolitical instability has far-reaching implications. \nInterestingly, and consistent with results for other groups \nanalyzed in our survey, resistance to change drops on the \n2024 list of top risks for manufacturing and distribution \norganizations, rounding out the top 10. However, given \nthe volatility in the business environment and technology-\ndriven transformation underway in many companies \n111\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later (e.g., Industry 4.0), it\u2019s imperative for leaders in these \norganizations to continue monitoring workplace culture \nto ensure teams are open to and embracing the use of \nemerging technologies and new ways of working.\nOverview of top risk issues in 2034\nLooking ahead to 2034, talent management emerges as \nthe top risk issue, mirroring current trends but projected \nto grow over the next decade. The challenge lies not only \nin attracting, developing and retaining top talent, but also \nin managing shifting worker expectations and addressing \nsuccession challenges against demographic changes, \nperception issues around manufacturing jobs\u2019 desirability \ncompared to other sectors like retail or services, the \naforementioned location of available jobs in more rural and \nremote locations globally, and evolving skill requirements \nresulting from technological advancements and ongoing \ntransformation initiatives.\nOver the next decade (and as is the case for most other \nindustries), cyber threats are expected to increase for \nmanufacturing and distribution organizations, necessitating \na dual focus on OT security and IoT devices \u2014 both \nthose used in manufacturing facilities as well as those \nproduced and distributed by manufacturers. The increased \nconnectivity brought about by Industry 4.0 creates more \nentry points for cyberattacks, while the emergence \nof sophisticated attacks and lack of preparedness \nheightens the risk. These threats will only grow long-\nterm as technological advances fuel greater capabilities \namong bad actors to attack and penetrate organizations\u2019 \ntechnology systems. Cybercriminals already are becoming \nmore sophisticated in targeting intellectual property and \nsensitive commercial data, as well as disrupting production \nlines \u2014 all of which carry serious financial ramifications.\nThe global focus on climate change and sustainability is \nexpected to become a paramount concern for manufacturing \nand distribution organizations over the long term. The \nindustry increasingly is coming under the spotlight as global \nefforts to combat climate change intensify. Particularly \nwithin energy-intensive sectors such as materials (cement, \niron and steel) and chemicals, the responsibility for reducing \ncarbon emissions is becoming significant. \nOver time, manufacturing and distribution organizations \nexpect to face greater scrutiny and potentially more \nclimate-related regulations. This is one factor driving \nthe high ranking of heightened regulatory changes and \nscrutiny in the 2034 risk outlook. As noted earlier, an \nevolving landscape of ESG regulations and increased \ndisclosure requirements adds further complexity to the \ncompliance efforts most manufacturers and distributors \nare undertaking. These organizations must navigate this \nintricate regulatory environment while ensuring their \noperations align with sustainability goals.\nA number of technology-related concerns permeate the top \n10 long-term risk issues for the industry group, including \nthe adoption of digital technologies requiring new skills in \nshort supply, the rapid speed of disruptive innovations, and \nexisting operations and legacy IT infrastructure unable to \nmeet performance expectations as well as \u201cborn digital\u201d \ncompetitors. These challenges underscore the gap board \nmembers and executives in the industry may perceive with \nregard to how their organizations are planning for and \nincorporating emerging technologies to help drive their \nbusinesses, as well as perceived skills and talent shortages.\n112\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later FIGURE 24A\nTechnology, Media and Telecommunications \u2014 2024\nFIGURE 24B\nTechnology, Media and Telecommunications \u2014 2034\n*\t This data was reported as 2032 and 2031 results, respectively, in our prior year reports.

Labor constraints and \neconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures, \nfollow closely at No. 2 and No. 3 respectively, according to \nProtiviti\u2019s 2024 Top Risks Survey. \nTMT executives were asked to identify the biggest threats \nthey anticipate over the next 12 months and a decade \nahead. Many of the risks cited correlate in many ways and \ncan be categorized under two broad themes: foundational \nrisks, which are essentially challenges that leaders must \naddress to keep their business thriving, and risks that are \nessential for continued growth and expansion.\nCyber threats\nCyber threats have consistently ranked among the biggest \nrisks confronting TMT executives. However, this year, \nglobal geopolitical tensions, including the Russian invasion \nof Ukraine and escalating trade tensions between the \nUnited States and China, have exacerbated the risk.\nInsider threats are a significant concern, especially as \ncompanies navigate hybrid work models, putting more \nsecurity responsibility on employees. The proliferation of \nartificial intelligence, cloud computing and the Internet \nof Things, which have significantly expanded the attack \nvectors, are also major factors.\nOrganizations must develop robust cybersecurity and \ninsider threat protection and rapid response programs to \nprotect their operations, which will allow for future growth.\nTackling the talent crisis\nTMT organizations are also increasingly worried about their \nability to attract, develop and retain top talent, manage shifts \nin labor expectations, and address succession challenges.\nSince the pandemic, many companies have experienced \nunusually high attrition rates, although large multilocational \norganizations that have been able to accommodate \nemployees seeking to relocate or transfer to different roles \nhave been less impacted. High-level departures have also \nhad devastating impacts on organizations. Replacing a \nC-suite executive or senior employee can be costly, although \ncompanies with deeper pockets, compared to startups and \nfledgling organizations, are able to absorb the impact better.\nOverall, TMT companies, small and large, are struggling \nwith succession planning. Many companies do not have \ndocumented succession plans and frequently fail to \nadequately communicate advancement pathways and \ndevelopment opportunities to valuable team members.\nThe talent gap extends also to the cyber workforce, where \ncompanies are desperate to train the next generation \nof cyber defenders. The weakening front line against \ncyberattacks may also explain why TMT executives are \ngrowing more nervous about cyber threats.\nInflationary pressures\nLike the talent issue, pressure from inflation is hitting TMT \ncompanies in several different ways, depending on market \nshare, pricing power and line of business, among other \nfactors. Larger tech companies have been renegotiating \nfavorable prices with their suppliers and many have been \nable to raise hardware prices and pass the higher costs \nto consumers. Those that do not have the same level of \npricing power are contending with margin compression and \naggressive cost cutting. \nThere are some signs that inflation may be cooling, but it \nremains at a level that has many executives up at night. \nTMT organizations, led by their CFOs, should lean on their \ndata, predictive analytics and advanced technology tools \nto help them make better strategic decisions on ways to \nfight inflation.\n114\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later Disruptive technologies\nThe impact of disruptive innovations and the ability to \nleverage new and emerging technologies to achieve \ngrowth is ranked fourth for 2024 by the TMT respondents. \nClosely related is a concern over the adoption of digital \ntechnologies requiring new skills in short supply, which is \nranked the No. 6 top risk for 2024.\nFrom artificial intelligence to wearable technology to \nnanotechnology to 5G, TMT companies have been the \ncatalyst for many disruptive technologies, but they also \nhave not been spared by disruptions associated with being \non the cutting edge of technology.\nIn the telecommunications industry, for example, wireless \ncarriers are competing not only with each other to advance \n5G coverage and features but also with cable providers, \nwho are looking to strengthen their position within the \nbroadband market.7\nGenerative AI is another new technology that is upending \nthe TMT industry. TMT finance leaders are already using \ngenerative AI for critical functions such as compliance \nand regulatory reporting. The technology is also fueling \nfierce competition among companies whose chips enable \nChatGPT.

Rising labor costs and talent shortages, along with \nanticipated changes in the regulatory environment and \ncontinued economic and inflationary pressures, are forcing \nhealthcare organizations and their respective boards to \ntake a hard look at long-term challenges to their existing \nbusiness models and plan for how they will transform their \norganizations to address these challenges now and for the \nlong run.\nContinued increases in labor costs are causing significant \nmargin erosion\nAcross the healthcare industry, the number one risk \nfor 2024 is the continuing increase in labor costs. The \ntightening of the healthcare labor market, exacerbated \nby the pandemic, has caused significant margin erosion, \nparticularly on the provider side. Hospital labor expenses, \nwhich account for half of hospitals\u2019 total budget on average, \nincreased by 20.8% between 2019 and 2022.8 Expenses for \ncontract labor, leveraged as a temporary solution since the \nonset of the pandemic, have increased 258% over the same \ntimeframe.9\nWith healthcare workers leaving the industry at high rates \ndue to factors such as burnout and aging, it is imperative \nthat the industry optimize and retain the labor that \nremains. The gap between staffing demand and supply has \nresulted in a 27% year-over-year increase in recruitment \nexpenses. Additionally, healthcare saw an increase in \norganized labor activity in 2023, with contract demands \nfor wage increases and better staffing conditions.10 The \nmacroeconomic factors driving increases in anticipated \nlabor costs include inflation, shortages of both clinical and \nnonclinical workers, and continued fierce competition for \nhealthcare workers with in-demand skills.\nRisk associated with increased labor costs are predicted \nwell into the future and remain in the top five concerns \nin 2034, dropping only two positions in rank. The World \nHealth Organization (WHO) Global Health Observatory \nmodel predicts that global demand for health workers will \nrise to 80 million by 2030 \u2014 twice the current supply \u2014 \nwhile the number of available health workers will reach \nonly 65 million, resulting in a worldwide shortage of 15 \nmillion workers.11 There is little relief in sight. Therefore, \nit will be essential to focus on worker productivity, \nestablishing new ways of working by rethinking and \nredesigning jobs, and increasing the use of technology, \nparticularly artificial intelligence (AI).\nWith healthcare workers leaving the \nindustry at high rates due to factors such \nas burnout and aging, it is imperative that \nthe industry optimize and retain the labor \nthat remains.\nEconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures, \ncontinue to erode margins\nGlobally, healthcare organizations continue to confront \nchallenging economic conditions as rising healthcare costs, \n8\t \u201cNew AHA Report Finds Financial Challenges Mount for Hospitals & Health Systems Putting Access to Care at Risk,\u201d American Hospital Association: www.aha.org. www.aha.org/press-releases/2023-04-20-new-aha-report-finds-financial-challenges-mount-hospitals-health-systems-putting-access-care-risk.\n9\t Ibid.\n10\t \u201cHealthcare labor union activity gains steam: The consequences for hospitals and health systems,\u201d Healthcare Financial Management Association: www.hfma.org/finance-and-business-strategy/healthcare-business-trends/healthcare-labor-union-activity-gains-steam-the-consequences-for-hospitals-and-health-systems/.\n11\t \u201cGlobal Health Workforce Labor Market Projections for 2030,\u201d Liu, Jenny X., Yevgeniy Goryakin, Akiko Maeda, Tim Bruckner, and Richard Scheffler, Human Resources for Health 15 (1), 2017: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12960-017-0187-2.\n117\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later inflation, labor shortages and COVID-endemic recovery \ncontribute to below-average operating margins, although \nthere is improvement from pandemic lows.\nHealthcare provider margins are improving at a much \nslower rate compared to the payer side. The healthcare \nprovider services market grew at a compound annual \ngrowth rate (CAGR) of 6.3% between 2022 and 2023 \n(with an anticipated CAGR of 5.3% in 2027),12 while the \nhealthcare payer services market has an anticipated CAGR \nof 7.71% by 2027.13 Median margin data indicate that half \nof U.S. hospital and health systems continue to operate at a \nfinancial loss, with many just covering their costs in 2023.14 \nThis is understandable as hospitals\u2019 total costs, including \nlabor costs, increased 17.5% during the pandemic. \nOutside of reimbursement rate hikes and growth in \nmarket share, healthcare organizations must look to cost-\ncutting measures and improvements in productivity and \nperformance to improve margins. Transformational change \nwill be required of organizations to maintain or return \nto positive operating margins as the global population \ncontinues to grow and age and value-based care models \ncontinue to be adopted and evolve. Across the board, \nthere is potential for increased costs driven by volume. \nIf organizations cannot balance the costs and healthcare \nspend of consumers, the organizations risk operating on \nnarrow margins.\nLooking toward 2034, care delivery will continue to become \nmore digital. Population health efforts will guide patients to \nthe most appropriate care setting more efficiently and with \ngreater care coordination. Successfully combining digital \ncapabilities with population health efforts will provide for \na higher quality of care at a much greater value, and the \nefficiencies gained should yield a positive operating margin.\nTools that support clinical decision-\nmaking, predictive analytics and remote/\nhybrid work are expected to enable a \nshift from people-driven to technology-\nsupported models of care.\nAbility to attract and retain talent and address succession \nchallenges remains a critical issue\nThe ability to attract and retain top talent in a continually \ntightening labor market remains one of the top five risks for \nhealthcare organizations for the third consecutive year. The \ncrisis in healthcare human resources has been described \nas one of the most pressing global health issues of our \ntime, as the WHO estimates a global shortage of 15 million \nhealthcare professionals by 2030.15\nAlmost one in three healthcare workers are considering \nleaving the industry due to burnout, job dissatisfaction \nand heavy demands for productivity and efficiency.16 \nThroughout the industry, the largest staffing concern and \nresulting pain point over the last few years has been clinical \nstaff retention.17 This troubling trend impacts not just \nthe bottom line; it also can diminish the accessibility and \nquality of patient care.

Transforming the workforce through a combination \nof job redesign, improved automation and reskilling/\nupskilling workers will create new career pathways, critical \nto engaging and retaining workers. AI and emerging digital \ntechnologies will continue to transform how healthcare \nis delivered.

The U.S. federal budget contains \ngreater funding than in prior years for enforcement, \nespecially related to healthcare fraud and investigative \nefforts. Priority areas include, but are not limited to:\n\t\u2022 Price and drug cost transparency\n\t\u2022 Access to quality care\n\t\u2022 Cybersecurity\n\t\u2022 Privacy (with potentially a new HIPAA regulation)\n\t\u2022 Medicare Advantage changes\n\t\u2022 Clinical research\n\t\u2022 Mental health\nChanges in the regulatory environment, \nincluding requirements around the use \nof technology, will be a constant for the \nhealthcare industry well into 2034, \nheightening focus on data security \nand privacy.\nCross-agency collaboration will likely continue to rise, \nespecially as data analytics become more sophisticated. In \n2023, the U.S. Department of Justice, together with federal \nand state law enforcement partners, brought charges \nagainst 78 defendants for their alleged participation in \nfraud and opioid abuse schemes, which included over $2.5 \nbillion in alleged fraud.18\nIn November 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG) \npublished new General Compliance Program Guidance for the \nhealthcare industry, addressing topics such as federal fraud \nand abuse laws, compliance program basics and operating \neffective compliance programs. Additional segment-specific \nguidance is promised, addressing topics including compliance \nrisk areas, compliance program best practices, and common \npitfalls.19 This is another indicator that the government is \nbecoming more serious about healthcare organizations having \neffective compliance programs.\nChanges in the regulatory environment, including \nrequirements around the use of technology, will be a \nconstant for the healthcare industry well into 2034, \nheightening focus on data security and privacy. Regulations \nand enforcement associated with access to care and patient \nprotections also will remain at the forefront, including \nprotections to facilitate health equity.

Ransomware incidents are \nparticularly perilous, as they can disrupt critical healthcare \nsystems, putting patient safety and organizational revenue, \ncompliance and reputation at risk. Because they have more \nto lose, healthcare providers and payers are prime targets.\nThe inherent complexity of data environments within \nhealthcare, with numerous entry and exit points, further \nexacerbates the challenge of protecting patients and their \ndata. Additionally, the altruistic nature of many healthcare \nprofessionals makes them especially susceptible to \nsocial engineering tactics. Outdated technology systems \nprevalent in healthcare further compound the problem by \nintroducing technical vulnerabilities, particularly if they \nhaven\u2019t kept up with regular security updates.\nOther emerging technologies, including the rise of AI, the \npotential ubiquity of quantum computing, the expansion \nof the Internet of Things (IoT), and the unceasing \nwave of digitization further add to the complexity. The \ncontinuing need to foster better interoperability in the \nhealthcare ecosystem only intensifies the need for robust \ncybersecurity measures. Healthcare organizations must \ndiligently plan for and invest in an enduring cybersecurity \nenhancement program.\nEvolving regulatory requirements and \nincreased risks of noncompliance will \ncontinue to increase the criticality \nof a comprehensive third-party risk \nmanagement strategy.\nFor 2034, cyber threats are expected to be the number \none risk for healthcare organizations, as they continue to \nbe challenged with recruiting and retaining a specialized \nworkforce capable of staying ahead of cyber adversaries. \nThis will require deep technical data security skills and \nthe ability to understand the complicated environments in \nwhich healthcare payers and providers operate. \nCybersecurity must be an ongoing journey.

As healthcare organizations struggle to keep up \nwith emerging technologies and margin pressures, failure to \nmanage vendor risks can leave them exposed to regulatory \naction, business outages, financial losses, litigation and \nreputational damage, and can impair the organization\u2019s ability \nto gain new or service existing customers.

But forward-thinking leaders are realizing \nthat the only status quo that will allow their businesses to evolve \noperationally, digitally and culturally to meet new demands and \nexpectations, drive innovation, and help shape the energy industry \nof the future is one of continuous change and strategic risk-taking.\nEnergy and utilities companies have been under increasing \npressure for years to modernize their operations and \nevolve to new business models that focus on sustainability. \nBut transformation has been a slow and challenging \nprocess for many of these organizations, largely because of \nsubstantial capital investments in the field with operations \nthat serve the needs of the business for many years. A \nproof point is the presence among the top 10 risks for this \nsector, year after year, of the operational risk \u201cResistance \nto change in our culture may restrict our organization from \nmaking necessary adjustments to the business model and \ncore operations on a timely basis.\u201d\nHowever, in our latest survey, things are markedly different. \nIn 2023, resistance to change ranked sixth, but on the \n2024 list, it has tumbled to 12th. Looking further out into \nthe future, we see an even more dramatic drop in the level \nof concern for this risk. Industry leaders ranked it second \nlast year on their list of top risks for the next decade \u2014 but \nthis year, it has plummeted to 22. That this risk is no longer \nviewed as a key concern, especially over the longer term, \nsuggests that many energy and utilities executives now see \nchange as the \u201cnew normal\u201d for their companies and industry. \nThe recent pandemic\u2019s disruption is certainly one factor \nfor this shift in attitude toward change \u2014 particularly, the \nneed to adapt to it and to drive it as a way to increase agility \nand resilience. But there is also recognition in this industry \nthat the shift toward more renewable and sustainable \nactivities will continue and likely accelerate, and companies \nmust respond effectively to that. Some energy and utilities \nbusinesses have already created a roadmap for how they \nwant and need to make an energy transition over time, and \nthus have more confidence about pursuing change.\nRapid advancements in technology and a need to be more \nagile are also breaking down the resistance to change \nwithin energy and utilities companies. More to the point, \nthere is greater acceptance in their organizational cultures \nthat this type of change is inevitable \u2014 and necessary. Many \ncompanies in the industry are well along with their digital \ntransformation efforts and are looking to evolve further to \ntake advantage of the latest trends, like AI. And as they, and \ntheir competitors, start to realize bottom-line benefits from \ntheir investments, resistance to change as an operational \nrisk will continue to fade.\nCyber threats and increased regulatory pressure top the \nrisk leaderboard for 2024\nIn our previous Top Risks Survey, we found that operational \nissues were a priority focus for energy and utilities leaders \nin 2023. The same is true for 2024, although the top-\nfive lineup now includes a strategic risk in the No. 2 spot: \nheightened regulatory changes and scrutiny. That this risk \nhas catapulted into the top five from 16th place in 2023 \nindicates that industry leaders are likely wondering what \nthe outcome of this election cycle could mean for the future \nregulatory landscape. \nMandates related to ESG issues \u2014 particularly, greenhouse \ngas emissions reporting \u2014 are also top of mind for leaders \nin the industry. They also see this as an ongoing challenge \nfor their organizations: They rank this risk fourth among \nthe top concerns for the industry in 2034, pulling it up from \neighth place on the 10-year outlook list last year.\nOne operational risk that has skyrocketed into the top five \nfor 2024 is cyber threats, up from 17th place last year. This \nis an acknowledgement by energy and utilities executives \n122\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later that their critical infrastructure businesses are, and will \nremain, a focus for adversaries. \nRansomware is an ongoing concern for this industry, as are \nsupply chain attacks. And while businesses in this industry \nhave transformed digitally to a large degree, particularly \nin their back-office operations like finance and accounting, \nmany still rely heavily on legacy technology, like SCADA \nsystems, for industrial operations, which can be vulnerable \nto attack. The adoption of new technology to be more \nconnected to the field also creates new security risks for \nenergy and utilities companies.\nSupply chain uncertainty has lessened \u2014 but remains a key \nconcern\nRounding out the top five risks for 2024 is \u201cuncertainty \nsurrounding our organization\u2019s core supply chain.\u201d This \nrisk dropped from second place on last year\u2019s list, which \nsuggests that pandemic-driven supply chain disruption \nin areas such as production and delivery has eased. Many \ncompanies in the energy and utilities industry have also \nmade a concerted effort in recent years to modernize their \nsupply chain and make it more resilient. That includes \ndeveloping formal supply chain capabilities and investing in \nnew technologies to increase visibility and predictability.\nWhat hasn\u2019t changed for the industry, though, is how reliant \nenergy companies are on their supply chains in general. We \nhave reported this in previous Top Risks Survey reports, but \nit is worth underscoring once again that supply chain risk \nis both significant and persistent for the energy industry \nbecause its value chain is highly service-, feedstock-, parts- \nand equipment-oriented.\nAnother factor contributing to uncertainty about supply \nchain viability may stem from the fact that many companies \nin the energy and utilities industry are embracing new \nbusiness models and innovating new products and services. \nThus, they may be facing the need to alter the makeup of \ntheir supply chain ecosystem to support those initiatives \nand work with new and untested partners.\nWorries about changing workplace dynamics and \nweather-related risks have also eased\nIn our previous Top Risks Survey, it was clear that evolving \nworkforce dynamics were weighing heavily on the minds of \nmany executives in the energy and utilities industry. But a \nyear later, it appears those worries have largely subsided. \nChallenges in sustaining culture due to change in the overall \nwork environment, like the shift to hybrid work, is an \noperational risk that has diminished, dropping from fourth \nplace on the 2023 list to 14th for 2024. Also, the risk of \nmanaging demands on or expectations of the workforce to \nwork remotely or as part of a hybrid work environment fell \nfrom fifth place last year to 25th in this year\u2019s survey.\nHowever, it is worth noting that the leaders of energy \nand utilities businesses are still concerned about the risk \npertaining to their organization\u2019s ability to attract, develop \nand retain top talent, manage shifts in labor expectations, \nand address succession challenges. The ranking of this \nrisk changed only slightly from last year\u2019s survey, moving \nfrom third to fourth place. This indicates that many energy \nand utilities companies are still struggling to recruit an \nample supply of talent to replace retiring workers and \ntake on new jobs that require specialized skills and digital \nsavvy. Another ongoing challenge is attracting younger \nprofessionals, many of whom prioritize working for \nsustainable companies, to take a job in an industry that they \nassociate with unfavorable environmental impacts.\nEnergy and utilities executives are also somewhat less \nconcerned than they were a year ago about their companies \nfacing operational challenges due to extreme weather \nthreats. The No. 1 risk cited by these leaders last year \nwas the rising threat associated with catastrophic natural \ndisasters and weather phenomena creating significant \noperational challenges that threaten a company\u2019s assets, \n123\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later employees, and ability to deliver products and services to \ncustomers. This year it ranks third, after cyber threats and \nregulatory changes. \nThis risk\u2019s slight slide within the top-five ranking may be \nanother indicator that energy and utilities companies are \ncoming to grips with the idea of change \u2014 and disruption \n\u2014 as their new status quo. Extreme weather events are, \nunfortunately, the new normal. In 2023, we saw historic \nheat, wildfires and storms, all of which had impacts on \ncritical energy infrastructure in one way or another. And \nthe reality is, no matter how much an oil and gas company \nor an electric utility does to increase its resilience and \nprotect its infrastructure, no measure is 100% foolproof \nagainst the unpredictable forces of nature.\nLooking ahead: The top risks for 2034 at a glance\nThe energy and utilities executives who responded to our \nlatest Top Risks Survey anticipate that their businesses will \nbe focused on managing a mix of operational and strategic \nrisks in 2034.\nThe two strategic risks are related to regulatory pressures: \nheightened focus on regulatory changes and scrutiny and \ngrowing focus on climate change and other sustainability \npolicies, regulations and expanding disclosure requirements \nas well as expectations of key stakeholders. These findings \nsignal that industry leaders expect their industry, which is \nalready highly regulated, is poised to become even more \nso as the focus on climate change, sustainability and other \nissues continues to intensify.\nCyber threats, an operational risk, ranks third among the \ntop five risks for 2034, moving up from 11th on last year\u2019s \nlist looking out 10 years. Leaders in the energy and utilities \nindustry clearly understand that their businesses will likely \nremain a favored target for cyber attackers, including nation-\nstate actors. However, that the cyber threats risk does not \nrank first, as it does on the 2024 list, may be a sign that these \nexecutives are hopeful they will have better cyber defenses \nin place by 2034 \u2014 including intelligent, AI-powered \nsolutions that can keep pace with rapidly evolving threats.\nThe rising threat of catastrophic natural disasters and \nweather phenomena is another key concern for 2034, but it \nhas dropped to second place after ranking first on last year\u2019s \nlist. Industry leaders also foresee continued challenges in \nattracting talent; this operational risk moves up to the fifth \nspot from sixth place in the previous year\u2019s top risks ranking.\nNotably, we see risks related to the adoption of digital \ntechnologies and the ability to use data analytics for \ncompetitive advantage falling out of the top five list for \nenergy and utilities companies in 2034. In fact, the latter \nrisk ranks 14th, dropping from fourth place. Concerns \nabout the rapid speed of disruptive innovation, which was \nfifth last year, is still in the top 10 \u2014 ranking seventh. \nThese findings suggest executives with energy and utilities \ncompanies may be confident that their organizations will \nhave undergone significant transformation by 2034. But \ngiven how quickly things change with technology and how \nmuch the energy industry itself is changing, they may also \nworry that their businesses will still be at risk of falling \nbehind and failing to compete effectively.\nAnother sign of that emerging concern is the presence of \nthe following strategic risk in the No. 8 spot, up from 25th \non last year\u2019s list: Substitute products and services may arise \nfrom competitors that enhance the customer experience \nand affect the viability of our current business model and \nplanned strategic initiatives. This isn\u2019t surprising given the \ngrowing investments in clean energy innovation and a belief \nthat newer advancements will need to be made in order to \nprovide the amount of clean energy needed. Maintaining \nan openness to change and having the agility to adopt new \ntechnologies over the next decade may be exactly what \nenergy and utilities businesses need to do to keep that \npotential risk at bay \u2014 or, at least, minimize its impacts.\n124\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later FIGURE 27A\nGovernment \u2014 2024\nFIGURE 27B\nGovernment \u2014 2034\n*\t This data was reported as 2032 and 2031 results, respectively, in our prior year reports.

However, the fact that issues related to talent, cyber \nthreats and legacy IT infrastructure remain ongoing \u2014 and in \nmany cases intensifying \u2014 concerns for government services \nleaders may reflect the need for wholesale changes in how \nthese risks are addressed and mitigated. \nThis is the case because the nature, magnitude and \ncauses of these challenges remain anything but steady. \nThe methods that bad actors (including but not limited to \nnation-states) deploy to breach cyber defenses continue to \nevolve at an accelerating pace at the same time that attack \nvectors are expanding throughout government agencies \ndue to digital accessibility and other factors. This explains \nwhy cyber threats are rated as a higher concern for 2024 \nthan they were in last year\u2019s survey for 2023 \u2014 and also \nwhy they expect cyber threats to become significantly more \nproblematic by 2034. \nThe ability of government organizations to attract, develop \nand retain top talent, manage shifts in labor expectations, \nand address succession challenges faces additional \nheadwinds as labor costs remain high and as an outsized \nportion of the public-sector workforce nears retirement \nage. The scope, cost and time required to replace legacy IT \nsystems are also increasing. Outdated technology systems \nlimit government services organizations\u2019 ability to meet \nperformance expectations and to respond with speed and \nefficacy to unexpected crises.\nAs leaders of government services \norganizations focus their attention on \nthe most pressing and prevalent risks \nin 2024, they should consider new \nmindsets and approaches for managing \ntalent, mitigating cyber threats and \nupdating legacy IT infrastructure.\nOverview of top risk issues in 2024\nWhile most of the top risk issues for the government \nservices sector in 2024 relate to talent, cybersecurity \nand legacy IT environments, organizational culture and \nresilience also represent urgent concerns, as does the \nability to respond to unexpected crises with resilience and \nagility. Government services leaders express reservations \nregarding the degree to which their organizational \ncultures encourage the timely identification and escalation \nof emerging risk issues. Whether the organization can \nrespond effectively and in an agile manner to unexpected \ncrises marks another top concern. \nAs leaders of government services organizations focus \ntheir attention on the most pressing and prevalent risks in \n2024, they should consider new mindsets and approaches \nfor managing talent, mitigating cyber threats and updating \nlegacy IT infrastructure. Doing so requires a solid grasp of \nthe multifaceted nature of these issues.\n\t\u2022 Talent management: Attracting, recruiting and retaining \nskilled workers are ongoing \u2014 and borderline endemic \n\u2014 challenges within government services. These \nareas also represent a long-term problem: Survey \nrespondents project talent-related risks as the second \nmost significant concern in 2034, just behind cyber \nthreats (see below). The historic allure of government \nservice (e.g., situations such as the Cold War and Space \nRace, which provided strong, non-financial motivation) \ndoes not appear to be motivating younger workers to \npursue government employment in the way people did \nin the latter half of the 20th century. Now, more \u201cbaby \nboom\u201d engineers who leapt at the opportunity to work \n126\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later for space programs in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s are \nretiring, and Gen X workers may not be far behind. From \n2020 to 2022, an average of more than 100,000 U.S. \nfederal workers retired each year. That\u2019s 36% higher \ncompared to the period from 2000 to 2002, when \napproximately 76,000 federal workers retired annually.20 \nRetirement-age federal employees now outnumber \nyounger employees by two to one in the United States, \nwhere there were more full-time permanent federal \nemployees in the 50\u201454 age bracket than any other \nage group in 2022.21 Furthermore, across the globe, \nsubsequent generations are far more likely to choose \nthe allure and higher pay of jobs in industries such as \ntechnology and financial services over government \nroles. Of note, for 2024, other talent management-\nrelated concerns include increasing labor costs (the third \nhighest-ranked risk issue) and the impact of social issues \nand DEI priorities on organizations\u2019 ability to attract and \nretain workers (a top 10 risk issue). \n\t\u2022 Cybersecurity: As is the case with talent management, \ncyber threats are an area of significant concern for \ngovernment agencies. To illustrate, in the United States, \nover the past dozen years or so the U.S. Government \nAccountability Office (GAO) has publicly issued \nmore than 700 recommendations related to securing \nfederal systems and information. \u201cUntil these are fully \nimplemented,\u201d a January 2023 GAO report states, \n\u201cfederal agencies will be more limited in their ability to \nprotect private and sensitive data entrusted to them.\u201d22 \nNot surprisingly, ensuring privacy and compliance with \ngrowing identity protection expectations also ranks \nas a top 2024 risk issue among government services \nrespondents. The same holds true for third-party risks \n(ranked in the top 10 for 2024), many of which relate \ndirectly to data privacy and security issues.\nAs government services leaders address cybersecurity, \nthey should keep in mind that attack surfaces are \nexpanding due to digital transformation progress \n(including the widespread shift to online services) \nand the increasing adoption of Internet of Things \n(IoT)-connected networks and applications. IoT \nsensors generate more data and provide bad actors, \nwho continually develop new modes of attack, with \nnew opportunities to breach organizational cyber \ndefenses. Smaller government organizations, including \nthose at the regional, province/state, and local levels, \nare especially vulnerable to cyber threats. Smaller \nagencies and departments generally have more limited \ncybersecurity budgets and less access to the knowledge \nand skills required to create and continually adapt \ntheir cybersecurity capabilities to new types of threats \nand attack modes. At the same time, because these \norganizations are perceived to be easier targets to \nbreach, bad actors increasingly are targeting them to \ndisrupt operations and interfere with elections through \nphishing, denial of service and ransomware attacks.\nAs government services leaders address \ncybersecurity, they should keep in mind \nthat attack surfaces are expanding due to \ndigital transformation progress (including \nthe widespread shift to online services) \nand the increasing adoption of IoT-\nconnected networks and applications.\n\t\u2022 Legacy IT: Government services organizations face \nscale, time, money and resource challenges when it \ncomes to addressing aging IT infrastructures through \ntechnology modernization. Mainframe systems designed \nin the 1970s and 1980s still underpin operations in \nmany government offices. These infrastructures have \nbeen held together with numerous makeshift, ad hoc \nsolutions by systems administrators who have already \nretired or will do so soon. In addition, given their age and \ndesign, many legacy systems have undergone extensive \ncustomization. In many cases, this means that upgrades \nare off the table, and that new, modern systems must be \n20\t www.opm.gov/retirement-center/retirement-statistics/.\n21\t https://usafacts.org/articles/how-old-is-the-federal-workforce/.\n22\t www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106428.\n127\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later implemented from scratch. While time-consuming and \nexpensive, such implementations are crucial to perform \nbecause outdated systems can limit organizational \nresilience and agility (another top 10 risk concern for \n2024) as well as the ability to recruit talented technology \nprofessionals who would rather work with advanced \ntools and technologies than perform troubleshooting \nand maintenance on antiquated systems. Additionally, \nmore large ERP vendors are establishing definitive \ntimelines for moving customers away from on-premises \nsolutions to cloud environments, further underscoring \nthe urgency to update legacy systems.\nIt is worth noting that ongoing political polarization \nand legislative gridlock frequently hinder the ability of \ngovernment services organizations to respond to many of \nthese risk issues. Budgeting brinkmanship at all levels of \ngovernment injects additional uncertainty into planning \nand forecasting activities.\nIntensifying geopolitical concerns reflect \nthe wars in Ukraine and the Middle East \nas well as rising tensions between China \nand Taiwan, among other flashpoints.\nOverview of top risk issues in 2034\nWhen government services leaders share their 10-year \noutlook, cybersecurity and talent management risk ratings \nare considerably higher, and they are joined by major \nconcerns related to natural disasters and regulatory \nrequirements focused on climate change and sustainability. \nIn last year\u2019s survey, the rising threat of catastrophic \nnatural disasters and weather phenomena barely rated as \na top 25 risk concern. For 2024, this risk issue figures as a \ntop 15 concern. By 2034, government services leaders rank \nthe threat of natural disasters in their top five (specifically, \nthird), with sustainability policies, regulations and \ndisclosure requirements not far behind. \nCatastrophic natural disasters are not the only concern that \ngovernment services survey respondents expect to become \nriskier during the next decade. Compared with last year\u2019s \nsurvey results related to the long-term risk outlook, this \nyear\u2019s respondents gave notably higher risk ratings to many \nof their longer-term concerns \u2014 including cyber threats, \nthird-party risks, and geopolitical shifts, regional conflicts \nand instability in government regimes or the expansion of \nglobal terrorism. \nOf note, similar to the roadblocks government agencies \nface with their 2024 top risks, political polarization and \ngridlock may inhibit their ability to respond to these issues \neffectively.\nHeightened geopolitical concerns reflect intensifying \nconflicts around the world. The survey results indicate an \nexpectation among government leaders that the current \nperiod of geopolitical conflict will sustain over the coming \ndecade. Government services leaders also view cyber \nthreats and talent-related risks as long-term challenges. \nHeightened regulatory changes and scrutiny along with \norganizational culture concerns (centered on the timely \nidentification and escalation of emerging risk issues) round \nout the list of highest-rated 2034 risk issues.\n128\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later", "Major takeaways about emerging risks": "Major takeaways about emerging risks\nWhat you need to know\nThe big picture: The churn in this year\u2019s survey results \npoints to multiple sources of uncertainty, painting a cloudy, \ninterconnected picture of the business landscape.\n\t\u2022 Near term, there is continued economic uncertainty causing \nexecutives to sharpen their focus on managing external \nrisks (inflation, cyber threats, interest rates, third-party \nexposures, etc.) and increasing organizational resilience. \nLong term, executives remain on guard for what comes \nnext \u2014 as illustrated by the uptick in risks following recent \nevents in the Middle East.\nA key point: Geopolitical events are driving notable changes in \nglobal risk perceptions.\n\t\u2022 Cyber threats, third-party risks, economic conditions, and \nthe ability to attract and retain talent are among many \nother risk issues exhibiting a significant ratings jump post \nOctober 7 in our survey.

Many of those events are expected \nto have long-lasting impacts on business models and the \ncompetitive balance in a nuanced global marketplace. \nBoard members and C-suite leaders who recognize \nthese shifting realities and address them through robust, \nenterprisewide risk analyses that are aligned with business \nstrategy possess a differentiating skill that positions their \norganization\u2019s readiness and ability to adjust and pivot in \nthe face of inevitable disruptive change as well as or better \nthan their competitors.\nThere are a number of significant takeaways from this \nyear\u2019s study for boards and executives to consider:\nThe churn in this year\u2019s survey for 2024 and escalation \nof importance of several risks point to multiple sources \nof uncertainty, painting a cloudy picture of the business \nlandscape.\nWhile not a surprise, our research results confirm that \norganizational risk profiles are sensitive to events and risks \nthat can emerge rapidly and sometimes unexpectedly. The \nescalation of the importance of multiple near- and long-\nterm risks conveys the stark reality of disruptive change in \ntoday\u2019s dynamic times. In the near term, there is continued \neconomic uncertainty causing executives to sharpen their \nfocus on managing external risks (inflation, cyber threats, \ninterest rates, third-party exposures, etc.) and increasing \norganizational resilience. As for the longer term, executives \nremain on guard for what comes next \u2014 as illustrated by \nrecent events in the Middle East.\nGeopolitical events drive notable changes in risk \nperceptions.\nA notable trend in our global results this year is what the \nfindings reveal before and after October 7, 2023, when \nevents in Israel and Gaza erupted. Based on the responses \nsubmitted prior to this date, no risks were rated at the \n\u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level for 2024, whereas after this \ndate four risks are rated at this level: economic conditions \n(including inflationary pressures), cyber threats, ability to \nattract and retain talent, and third-party risks. In addition, \nthe scores for most risk issues increased post October 7, \nincluding the risk related to geopolitical shifts, regional \nconflicts and instability in governmental regimes or \nexpansion of global terrorism. \nWhat\u2019s even more telling are the risk scores in the 10-year \noutlook. Whereas five of the long-term risk issues were \nrated at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level among responses \nsubmitted prior to October 7, respondents after this date \nrated 12 at this level. Among the many notable jumps in \nscores, the geopolitical-related risk issue rose from 5.35 \nprior to October 7 to 6.06 after this date \u2014 highlighting \nit as \u201cSignificant Impact.\u201d Cyber threats, third-party risks, \neconomic conditions, and the ability to attract and retain \ntalent are among many other risk issues exhibiting a \nsignificant ratings jump. Clearly, events in the Middle East are \nelevating long-term concerns among directors and C-suite \nleaders about the impact on their businesses.\nEconomic conditions, including inflation, represent the \ntop risk issue for 2024. \nEconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures, are \nthe top-rated risk overall for 2024 (up from second in 2023). \nNear term, uncertainty continues in the market over central \nbank policies amid persistent inflation being fueled by rising \nlabor costs (driven by robust employment and skilled labor \nshortages, particularly in countries where birth rates have \ndropped significantly), outsized government stimulus, the \nWest\u2019s de-risking reliance upon China, regional conflicts, \nother developments in the geopolitical landscape, and \nincreasing shelter, food and energy prices. The open question \nis whether these market developments and policies will lead \n13\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later to some form of soft landing or to either a mild or severe \nrecession; or worse, a sustained period of stagnant growth. \nOrganizations may face a dramatic change in the business \nlandscape in the coming year, especially considering recent \nevents in the Middle East and their potential to spread \nthroughout the region. \nUnderlying the uneasiness about the economy are concerns \naround the current interest rate environment significantly \naffecting the organization\u2019s capital costs and operations. Of \nnote, while the rating for most risks in our survey decreased \nyear-over-year looking out 12 months, economic risk \ndeclined the least among those risks that decreased from \nlast year\u2019s survey, remaining relatively stable year-over-year. \nLooking out 10 years, economic conditions represent the \nseventh-ranked risk. Economic headwinds remain a concern \nover the long-term, beyond the shorter-term issues such as \ninflationary trends that are driving current concerns.\nCybersecurity is the most pressing risk issue when \ncombining near- and long-term views.\nWhile the economy is the top-ranked risk for the coming \nyear, cyber threats arguably stand out as the most \nsignificant risk issue for boards and C-suite leaders when \nassessing both near- and long-term outlooks. For the \nnext decade, cyber threats jumped from the 13th-ranked \nrisk in last year\u2019s study to the top-rated risk for the 2034 \noutlook. For this time period, the risk rating for cyber \nthreats increased more than 11% \u2014 by far the largest risk \nrating increase noted in the survey. Cyber concerns are also \nelevated near term, jumping from 15th in last year\u2019s survey \nto third this year when looking out 12 months. \nElevated cybersecurity concerns reflect growing recognition \nof a complex cyber risk landscape that is impacted by the \nexponential curve of technological advances. Specifically, \nconsidering the significance with which boards and C-suite \nleaders view this risk over the next 10 years, it\u2019s possible that \ntechnologies such as AI (including generative AI), cloud, and \neven the anticipated emergence of quantum computing and \nhow organizations will secure their data and operations in a \npost-quantum world are raising significant security-related \nquestions and concerns in the boardroom and C-suite. But \nother forces, such as increasing reliance on third parties and \ngeopolitical tensions, also contribute to the threat landscape. \nRegarding the geopolitical picture, competing national \ninterests, nation-state territorial aspirations and global \nterrorism are powerful forces that can affect cyber risk \nassessments in particular regions and countries.\nEnsuring privacy and compliance with growing identity \nprotection expectations made the top 10 for 2024 as well, \ndemonstrating the interrelated nature of cybersecurity and \nprivacy risks.\nAmid economic and cyber concerns, people-related risks \nalso remain top of mind; culture and workplace evolution \nhave taken a back seat \u2014 at least for now. \nA number of important themes related to people and \nculture emerged from our results:\n\t\u2022 Finding and keeping talent remains a major concern, \neven amid an uneven economy. This is the second \nhighest-ranked risk for both 2024 and 2034. \n\t\u2022 The need to reskill and upskill employees is a challenge \nboth now and in the future. The state of labor markets \nand the expected adoption of digital technologies \nrequiring new skills in short supply are such that \nsignificant efforts will be necessary to upskill and reskill \nexisting employees over the next decade. This is the sixth- \nand third-ranked risk, respectively, for 2024 and 2034. It \nis clear that the solution to growth is rooted in increasing \nproductivity, not headcount. Embracing technology is \npart of the solution, particularly in countries where the \nworking population is declining, immigration policy is not \naligned with this reality and offshoring is giving way to \nre-shoring. These market forces necessitate the need for \nupskilling the existing workforce.\n\t\u2022 Rising labor costs continue to be a persistent concern. \nDriven by shortages in skilled labor, increases in labor costs \nrepresent the ninth-ranked risk for both 2024 and 2034. \n\t\u2022 Broader return-to-work trends in the market, \nworkplace evolution are less of an issue. Managing \n14\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later demands on or expectations of the workforce to work \nremotely or as part of a hybrid work environment fell \nto the 24th-ranked risk for 2024, down from ninth for \n2023. Leaders are seeing more clearly how to deal with \nthis issue as the workplace continues to evolve. They are \nadapting to a world profoundly affected by the pandemic \nexperience, a world in which many exited the workforce, \nhave rethought work-life balance and/or are re-entering \nthe workforce with different priorities.\n\t\u2022 Culture-related risks have fallen in relative importance. \nResistance to change restricting the organization \nfrom adjusting its business model and core operations \nfell from the fourth-ranked risk in both the 12-month \nand 10-year outlooks last year to 14th and 18th, \nrespectively, this year. The organization\u2019s culture not \nsufficiently encouraging timely identification and \nescalation of emerging risk issues fell from eighth to \n17th in the 12-month outlook and from 16th to 21st \nin the 10-year outlook. These declines may be due \nto companies\u2019 emphasis on increasing organizational \nresilience and employees\u2019 risk awareness in a rapidly \nevolving business environment. \nThird-party risks rise in importance. \nInterestingly, relative to other risks, third-party risks \nincreased from 17th and 15th in last year\u2019s 12-month and \n10-year outlooks, respectively, to fourth and sixth for 2024 \nand 2034, respectively, in this year\u2019s survey. This increase \nis likely due to increasing reliance on outsourcing and \nstrategic sourcing arrangements, ecosystem partners, IT \nvendor contracts, and other partnerships/joint ventures \nto achieve operational and go-to-market objectives. \nCyber threats and regulatory compliance risks (e.g., \ndata privacy regulations) also come into play here, as \norganizations must ensure their third-party vendors (as \nwell as their third parties\u2019 vendors further downstream) \nare complying with current laws and regulations. It may \nalso be attributable to the geopolitical climate, e.g., the \nWest de-risking its reliance on China, laws and regulations \nrestricting business activities and operations in certain \ncountries, and other developments having implications that \nextend to an organization\u2019s reliance on third parties. These \ninterconnected risks highlight the importance for boards \nand C-suite executives to take a portfolio, enterprisewide \nview of oversight of emerging risks. \nThe specter of regulatory changes and scrutiny \u2014 in wide-\nranging industry-specific and pervasive areas \u2014 looms \nboth near- and long-term. \nHeightened regulatory changes and scrutiny increased \nrelative to other risks, both near-term and long-term. \nThis issue is the fifth-ranked risk overall for both 2024 \nand 2034, up from 16th and ninth overall in last year\u2019s \n12-month and 10-year outlooks, respectively. As continued \neconomic uncertainty increases the likelihood governments \nand various agencies will interfere with market functions \nthrough regulatory overreach and even excess, directors \nand C-suite leaders appear to perceive uncertainty over \nthe likelihood and magnitude of forthcoming changes in the \nregulatory landscape that will affect their organizations. \nThese concerns are often industry-specific. For example:\n\t\u2022 In financial services, various regulations in different \nregions may increase capital and liquidity requirements \nand compliance costs, resulting in higher borrowing \ncosts and reduced shareholder returns. \n\t\u2022 Technology companies face increasing accountability \nfor the impact of their innovations and products on \nconsumers and the public, including the social implications \nof third-party content that misinforms and disinforms.\n\t\u2022 Energy and utility organizations face scrutiny on the \nenvironmental impact from their production and use of \nfossil fuels.\nIn addition, a growing number of laws and regulations \nemerging around the world have pervasive impacts \nacross industries. Examples include data privacy, climate \ndisclosures, sustainability reporting, cyber breach \ndisclosures, expanded attestation requirements and other \nmatters, all of which may be elevating concerns among \norganization leadership. Many of these pervasive issues fall \nto public companies. Accordingly, it is noteworthy that they \nwere the only organizational type to report a slight increase \nin the overall magnitude and severity of risks for 2024.\n15\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory risk was \nalmost always rated a top 10 risk since this global survey \nbegan 12 years ago. Now that the pandemic is in the \nrearview mirror for most observers, regulatory uncertainty \nappears to have reclaimed its \u201crightful place\u201d in the global \nrisk profile. \nThe 10-year top risks outlook: More disruptive times lie \nahead. \nLong-term, the top risks landscape is relatively stable, as \neight of the top 10 risks last year are on this year\u2019s top 10 \nlist. However, risk levels longer-term are elevated over the \n10-year outlook last year and the near-term outlook this \nyear. Six of the risks are rated at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level \n(versus three last year). Risk issues of concern looking out \n10 years include cyber threats, attracting and retaining top \ntalent and labor and succession challenges, the need for new \nskills to fully deploy newly adopted digital technologies, rapid \nspeed of disruptive innovation, evolving regulatory issues, \nthe impact of third-party risks on business performance and \nbrand image, uncertain economic conditions, the limiting \nobstruction of aged technical architecture, anticipated \nlabor cost increases, and inability to deploy advanced data \nanalytics (the \u201cbig data\u201d problem). \nThis dynamic risk landscape and its elevated risk levels \nsustain the ongoing narrative that the 2020s are indeed \na decade of disruption. With continued advances in AI, \nautomation in all of its forms, ever-increasing connectivity, \nquantum computing, blockchain and digital currencies, \nand the metaverse, the market is likely to experience the \nlargest wave of disruption since the turn of the century. \nThis disruption will manifest itself in many ways, e.g., \nnew business models, rapid product innovation, changing \ncustomer value propositions and disintermediation of \ndistribution channels, and different needs for skills and \ntalent. It will sweep away obsolete strategies, traditional \nmoats, technical debt-laden architectures, conventional \nmanagement playbooks and old school employee skills. \nThe never-ending question every organization faces in the \nglobal marketplace: Are we being disrupted and, if so, how \nand when would we know? \nData privacy and \u201cbig data\u201d remain key areas of focus. \nThe complexity of the data privacy regulatory environment \ncontinues as a priority for organizations. Risks associated \nwith data privacy are ranked 10th for 2024 and 11th \nfor 2034, compared with being ranked 12th and fifth, \nrespectively, for the 12-month and 10-year outlooks in \nlast year\u2019s survey. Conversely, the risk of inability to utilize \nrigorous data analytics to achieve market intelligence and \nincrease productivity and efficiency is ranked 10th overall \nlooking out 10 years but is the 11th-ranked risk for 2024. \nOrganizations successful in deploying forward-looking \nlead indicators and integrated analytics are likely to be \nmore anticipatory and less reactive than those that aren\u2019t \n\u2014 and leaders know it. These capabilities generate the \ninformation and insights so essential to arming decision-\nmakers with a time advantage in disruptive markets. \nClimate change and sustainability risks have elevated. \nGrowing focus on climate change and other sustainability \npolicies, regulations and expanding disclosure requirements \nas well as expectations of key stakeholders increased \nfrom the 28th-ranked risk looking out 12 months last year \nto the 22nd-ranked risk this year. Interestingly, looking \nout 10 years, this issue increased from the 20th-ranked \nrisk last year to the 13th-ranked risk this year. Typically \nassociated with existential planetary threats, climate- and \nsustainability-related risks are garnering more attention \nat a micro level by individual organizations relative to \nother risks. Growing regulatory focus (e.g., the Corporate \nSustainability Reporting Directive in the EU) is likely to \nkeep this risk issue on the radar long-term. Note that the \nfocus on climate change and sustainability is the second \nhighest-rated risk in Europe. Therefore, it is important that \nleadership teams in regions such as the U.S., where ESG is \nperceived as a polarizing concept, not construe the regional \nview as representative of a global perspective.\n16\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later Concerns over supply chain issues have subsided. \nUncertainty surrounding the core supply chain ecosystem \nis ranked 19th for 2024, quite a fall from ranking fifth \nin 2023. Many of the issues in the supply chain were a \nproduct of the disruption and congestion caused by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. These issues have been unwinding \nfor some time. This risk was not viewed as a significant \nlong-term concern last year and is not this year (ranked \n25th looking out to 2034).\nRisk levels declined from last year but remain higher than \ntwo years ago. \nThe participants were invited to rate the magnitude \nand severity of the total risk landscape impacting their \norganizations achieving performance goals over the next \n12 months. On a 10-point scale, the overall ratings over the \nlast three years are 6.35 looking forward to 2024, 6.70 for \n2023 and 6.21 for 2022, as illustrated in Figure 1.\nOf note, impressions of the magnitude and severity of the \nrisk landscape organizations will face over the next 12 \nmonths showed some differences pre- and post-October \n7, 2023, when the Israel-Gaza events erupted.

Only one of the top 10 risks is of a strategic nature. \nConsistent with the prior year study where only one of the \ntop 10 risks was rated as a \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d risk, none \nof the top 10 risks for 2024 is rated at that level. Three of \nthe top 10 risks for 2024 are rated higher than they were \nin 2023: cyber threats, third-party risks, and heightened \nregulatory change and scrutiny.\nOverarching concerns about economic conditions, \nparticularly worries about ongoing inflationary pressures, \nare top of mind for executives for 2024. Uncertainties \nabout policy decisions among central banks, coupled with \nconcerns about the current interest rate environment \n(which also made the top 10 risks \u2014 ranked eighth \u2014 for \n2024), may reflect executive worries about how the overall \neconomy may restrict growth opportunities and squeeze \nmargins as operating costs and the cost of capital are \nhigher. Indeed, many executives must now operate in an \nenvironment of higher interest rates and inflation that they \nmay have never faced before. \nMacroeconomic challenges related to the labor \nmarket, particularly rising labor costs and difficulties in \nattracting unique skills needed to adopt emerging digital \ntechnologies successfully, add to economic concerns for \nglobal executives in 2024. Ongoing frustrations around \ncompensation, managing flexible work options, mental \nhealth issues and other workplace challenges continue \nto create challenges in attracting and retaining the right \ntalent needed for strategic success. Employee workplace \nexpectations continue to evolve, union bargaining power \nis increasing and respondents are concerned that the \norganization may not be able to adjust appropriately \nto compete in the highly competitive talent and skilled \nlabor marketplace. This continues to create challenges \nfor organizations as they attempt to determine their \nlong-term strategies for talent acquisition and retention. \nUnderstandably, there are concerns about higher labor \ncosts impacting profitability expectations.\nOperational risks dominate the top 10 list of risks for 2024, \nwith five of the top 10 risks linked to business process \nchallenges. Technology-dependent operations, especially \nthose related to ensuring appropriate cybersecurity and \ndata privacy and protection, are of concern for executives, \nespecially as expectations and regulations continue to \nincrease surrounding the protection of systems and data. \nRecent high-profile cybersecurity events affecting name-\nbrand entities, coupled with increased regulations in the \nUnited States surrounding disclosure requirements related \nto cyber events, have drawn attention to the realities \nof how perpetrators can shut down core operations, \nEmployee workplace \nexpectations continue to \nevolve, union bargaining \npower is increasing and \nrespondents are concerned \nthat the organization may not \nbe able to adjust appropriately \nto compete in the highly \ncompetitive talent and skilled \nlabor marketplace.\n36\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later paralyzing an entity\u2019s ability to deliver their core products \nand services until their demands, including ransomware \npayments, are met.\nConcerns about existing operations and legacy IT systems \nlimiting an organization\u2019s ability to adjust core business \nprocesses to compete against more agile and nimble \u201cborn \ndigital\u201d competitors are adding to the overall operational \nrisk profile on the minds of executives. To address these \nprocess limitations, many organizations are turning to third-\nparty partners, joint ventures, and IT service providers and \ncloud computing to respond to evolving market conditions \nmore quickly. While addressing process limitations and \nresilience objectives, the increased reliance on third parties \nis leading to a different risk concern regarding how risks and \nvulnerabilities at the third party may actually impact the \norganizations that are dependent on them. In light of that, \nconcerns about third-party risks zoomed into the top 10 list \nof risks for 2024, jumping from the 17th position in 2023 to \nthe fourth position for the coming year.\nThe one strategic risk in the 2024 top 10 risks relates to \nheightened executive concern about regulatory change and \nscrutiny affecting the way their organization\u2019s processes \nare designed and products or services are produced \nor delivered. For example, recently approved climate-\nrelated risk disclosures for entities with operations in \nthe European Union along with new and forthcoming \nclimate-related disclosures for U.S. public entities, \nproliferating data privacy regulations, stronger focus on \nthe timeliness and fairness of cyber breach disclosures, as \nwell as industry-specific developments are significantly \nexpanding expectations for aligning processes and \nemphasizing disclosure enhancements on a timelier basis. \nIn other situations, rising societal and market participant \nexpectations, even outside those of a rulemaking nature, \nare raising the bar for how organizations can do business in \nthe competitive marketplace, e.g., sustainability reporting \nand widespread greenwashing and greenhushing concerns. \nMeeting those expectations can be costly and impactful to \nreputation, brand image and profitability goals.\nMajority of respondents view most top \n10 risks as significant\nTable 2 reveals the overall percentage of respondents who \nscored each of the top 10 risks at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d \n(or \u201cHigh) level (6.0 or higher), as well as the percentage of \nrespondents who rate each as a 5.0 (\u201cMedium\u201d) or as 4.0 or \nbelow (\u201cLow\u201d) for 2024. This provides another perspective \non the view of the top risk issues globally \u2014 the dispersion \nof the results distinct from individual average scores. The \nperception that the overall risk environment for 2024 \ncontinues to be significant (an average of 6.35 on a 10-point \nscale) is supported by the fact that 50% or more of board \nmembers and executives rate all of the top five risks at the \n\u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level (e.g., they chose 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 on \nour 10-point Likert scale), with just under a majority rating \nthe remaining top 10 risks at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level. \nThis disparity suggests uncertainty around the extent to \nwhich these top risks have the potential to impact most \norganizations noticeably in the coming year.\nMany organizations are turning to \nthird-party partners, joint ventures, \nand IT service providers and cloud \ncomputing to respond to evolving \nmarket conditions more quickly.\n37\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later TABLE 2\nTop 10 risks (with percentages of responses by impact level) \u2014 20241\nRisk description\nType of risk\nHIGH\nMEDIUM\nLOW\n6 -10\n5\n1-4\nEconomic conditions, including inflationary pressures \nMacroeconomic\n58%\n16%\n26%\nAbility to attract, develop and retain top talent, manage shifts in labor expectations, and \naddress succession challenges\nOperational\n56%\n17%\n27%\nCyber threats \nOperational\n56%\n16%\n28%\nThird-party risks \nOperational\n53%\n17%\n30%\nHeightened regulatory changes and scrutiny\nStrategic\n50%\n17%\n33%\nAdoption of digital technologies requiring new skills in short supply \nMacroeconomic\n50%\n16%\n34%\nExisting operations and legacy IT infrastructure unable to meet performance \nexpectations as well as \u201cborn digital\u201d competitors \nOperational\n50%\n18%\n32%\nChange in current interest rate environment\nMacroeconomic\n49%\n17%\n34%\nIncreases in labor costs \nMacroeconomic\n49%\n16%\n35%\nEnsuring privacy and compliance with growing identity protection expectations \nOperational\n48%\n18%\n34%\n1\t The risks presented in Table 2 are in the same top 10 risk order as reported in Figure 2.

As discussed previously, to help \nidentify differences in risk concerns across respondent type, \nwe group all the risks based on their average scores into one \nof three classifications. Consistent with our prior studies, \nwe use the following color-coding scheme to highlight risks \nvisually using these three categories.\nIn Table 3, we summarize the impact assessments for each \nof the 36 risks for the full sample arranged by the three \ncategories of risks we analyze: macroeconomic, strategic \nand operational. For each risk, the column labeled \u201c2024 \nRank\u201d indicates that risk\u2019s relative position among the 36 \nrisks for 2024, with rank \u201c1\u201d representing the risk with the \nhighest overall impact score for 2024.\nEven though a majority of respondents rated all of the top \nfive risks at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level, none of the 36 \nrisks is, on average, at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level when \ncombining the ratings of all respondents for each risk. This \nis relatively consistent with the prior three years, where \none in 2023, none in 2022 and only one in 2021 were \nrated at that level, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nThe other 35 risk issues fall into the category of \u201cPotential \nImpact\u201d risks. None of the risks is rated at the lowest level \n(\u201cLess Significant Impact\u201d) for 2024, which is consistent \nwith last year.

Executives are focused on whether their \norganizations can respond to rapidly emerging innovations \nthat may disrupt their business models and operations.\nTalent risks also stand out: Lack of ability to attract, \ndevelop and retain the talent needed to manage emerging \ntechnologies may significantly impede competitive \ncapabilities in the marketplace. \n\t\u2022 Those concerns reflect an overall worry about the ability \nto compete in the marketplace profitably in the long term. \nEyeing the regulatory landscape: Executives and boards are \nfocused on the potential for new regulations to emerge \u2014 \nrelated to social, privacy and environmental issues, among \nother changes \u2014 as expectations around what is deemed \nacceptable continue to shift. \nThe interrelated nature of global risks: Despite efforts \nto retreat from globalization, organizations continue to \noperate in an interdependent but highly competitive global \nmarketplace. Shifting global optics create fresh nuances and \ncomplexities in evaluating global risks.\nBetween the lines: There is significant overlap in the risk \nlandscape when comparing the top 10 short-term risks \n(2024) with the long-term risks (2034). This continuity \nsuggests short-term risk concerns may have a lingering \nimpact on organizations over the next decade.\nIn addition to obtaining respondent perspectives \nabout risks on the horizon for 2024, we asked \nthem to provide insights about long-term impacts \nof those same risks over the next decade \u2014 2034. \nThe top 10 global risks for 2034 appear in Figure \n3, alongside scores from our two prior years (also \nlooking out a decade ahead when asked).\n45\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later Cyber threats \n6.44\n5.78\n5.36\nO\nAbility to attract, develop and retain top \ntalent, manage shifts in labor expectations, and \naddress succession challenges\n6.27\n6.18\n5.88\nO\nAdoption of digital technologies requiring \nnew skills in short supply \n6.16\n6.11\n6.00\nM\nRapid speed of disruptive innovations enabled \nby new and emerging technologies and/or \nother market forces \n6.15\n6.04\n5.79\nS\nHeightened regulatory changes and scrutiny\n6.13\n5.83\n5.63\nS\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nThird-party risks \n6.00\n5.75\n5.40\nO\nEconomic conditions, including \ninflationary pressures \n5.95\n5.84\n5.67\nM\nExisting operations and legacy IT \ninfrastructure unable to meet performance \nexpectations as well as \u201cborn digital\u201d \ncompetitors \n5.91\n5.85\n5.34\nO\nIncreases in labor costs \n5.87\n5.82\n5.42\nM\nInability to utilize rigorous data analytics \nto achieve market intelligence and increase \nproductivity and efficiency\n5.79\n5.84\n5.47\nO\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nFIGURE 3\nTop 10 risks for 2034\n*\t This data was reported as 2032 and 2031 results, respectively, in our prior year reports.

This suggests that concerns about long-term \nrisks are greater than what they perceived last year. This is \nespecially noticeable when viewing the sizeable increase \nin the perceived risk of cyber threats for 2034, which is the \nnumber one risk concern a decade out. \nInnovation, technology and related talent concerns \ndominate the top five risks for 2034. In addition to cyber \nthreats making the top of the risk list, executives are also \nfocused on whether their organizations will be able to \nrespond to rapidly emerging innovations that can disrupt \nbusiness models and the way they do business. Their lack \nof ability to attract, develop and retain the talent needed \nto manage emerging technologies may significantly impede \ntheir competitive capabilities in the marketplace. Those \nconcerns, coupled with potential limitations tied to existing \noperations and legacy IT systems and increases in labor \ncosts to retain the talent once acquired, reflect an overall \nworry about their abilities to compete in the marketplace \nprofitably in the long term. Limited digital thinking and \nexpertise, particularly in the C-suite, may make it difficult \nfor the organization to compete in a digital marketplace. \nFurthermore, survey respondents are concerned about \nhaving the data analytics and \u201cbig data\u201d capabilities to gain \ninsights about customer experiences and markets to inform \ndecision-making as well as take advantage of operational \nefficiency opportunities. Clearly, talent and technology \nconcerns are intertwined over the long term.\nRisks related to the escalation of regulatory changes \nand scrutiny, worries about growing dependencies on \nthird-party relationships to do business, and long-lasting \nunfavorable economic conditions dominate the list of \nrisk concerns for executives as they look into long-term \nhorizons. Respondents are also focused on potential shifts \nin regulatory priorities and how changes in regulations \nmight impact the way their organizations\u2019 processes \nare designed and how their products are produced and \ndelivered. As executives and boards look a decade out, \nthey are focused on the potential for new regulations to \nemerge as expectations around what is deemed acceptable \ncontinue to shift. Perhaps, as these leaders reflect on \nrapidly shifting expectations over the last decade \u2014 or even \nrecent years \u2014 related to social, privacy and environmental \nissues, among other changes, they are projecting ahead a \nsimilar noticeable shift as they keep a wary eye on potential \nscenarios and developments over the next decade.\nBut there is another important dimension to the long-term \noutlook \u2014 the running thread through this survey report \nregarding the interrelated nature of global risks. As noted \nin our commentary regarding the post-October 7 survey \nresults, the attack on Israel resulted in an uptick in the risks \nrated after the war started. Despite efforts to retreat from \nglobalization, the reality is that organizations continue to \noperate in an interdependent but highly competitive global \nmarketplace. Shifting global optics create fresh nuances \nand complexities in evaluating global risks. \nThere is quite a bit of overlap in the risk landscape when \ncomparing the top 10 short-term risks (2024) with the long-\nterm risks (2034). Eight of the top 10 risks appear on both \nlists. Likewise, eight of the top 10 risks looking out 10 years \nlast year are on this year\u2019s list. This continuity suggests that \nthe short-term risk concerns noted this year may likely have \na lingering impact on organizations over the next decade. \nTable 6 highlights the two risks making the top 10 for 2034 \nthat were not in the top 10 for 2024. Strategic concerns \nrelated to the rapid speed of disruptive innovations enabled \nby new and emerging technologies (e.g., generative AI) \nand other market forces suggest executives are focused \non ensuring their organizations can compete successfully \nby changing at the speed of the market. Respondents are \nalso concerned about their organization\u2019s inability to utilize \nrigorous data analytics to achieve market intelligence, \nconnect with the customer experience, and identify \noperational and market efficiencies.\n47\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later TABLE 6\nTwo risks for 2034 not in top 10 list for 2024\nRisk description\n2034\nRank\n2034 \nResponse\n2024\nRank\n2024 \nResponse\nRapid speed of disruptive innovations enabled by new and \nemerging technologies and/or other market forces \n4\n6.15\n13\n5.28\nInability to utilize rigorous data analytics to achieve market \nintelligence and increase productivity and efficiency \n10\n5.79\n11\n5.42\nRecall that risks with average scores of 6.0 or higher are \nclassified as \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d risks, while risks with \naverage scores of 4.51 through 5.99 are classified as having \na \u201cPotential Impact.\u201d Risks with average scores 4.5 or below \nare classified as having a \u201cLess Significant Impact.\u201d In Figure \n3, we see that six of the top 10 long-term risks are rated at \nthe \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level looking out to 2034.

In both categories, \nrespondents rated all of their top five risks as higher in \n2024 relative to 2023. Two of the top five risks are at the \n\u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level for organizations with revenues \nbetween $100 million and $999 million, while three of the \ntop five risks for organizations with revenues less than \n$100 million are at that level. In contrast, none of the top \nfive risks for the largest organizations (revenues greater \nthan $10 billion) is at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level, and \nnone of the top five risks for organizations with revenues \nbetween $1 billion and $9.9 billion is rated at that level. \nCollectively, this suggests smaller-sized organizations \nperceive the risk environment as more impactful for them \nin 2024 relative to larger organizations.\nThree risks are common top five issues across all size \ngroups: (1) Concerns about attracting and retaining talent, \nincluding succession challenges; (2) concerns that economic \nconditions (and inflationary pressures) in markets served \nmay affect growth and profitability; and (3) concerns about \ncyber threats. Except for the largest size organizations, \nconcerns about economic conditions represent the first- \nor second-ranked risk across all organization sizes, while \ncybersecurity concerns are higher in the top five list of \nrisks for the two largest-sized organization categories \nrelative to the smaller categories. Perhaps their sizes may \nbe perceived as increasing their visibility to cyber threat \nperpetrators who might seek to target more recognizable \ncompanies and brands in the marketplace.\nConcerns about heightened regulatory changes and scrutiny \nare a top five risk for the two largest-size categories of \norganizations. Some of these regulations, such as the new \nclimate-related disclosure rules in the European Union \n(and the SEC\u2019s proposed climate disclosure rules) and other \nmatters discussed earlier, come with expanded responsibilities \nfor the largest organizations. The largest organizations are \nalso especially concerned about risks related to their existing \noperations and legacy IT systems. That risk was not in the top \nfive list of risks for all other sizes of organizations. \nThird-party risks make the list of top five risk concerns for \norganizations in the two middle ranges of organizational \nsize. Perhaps reliance on third-party partners and vendors \nis more notable for these organizations as they seek growth \nopportunities over time. The two smaller-sized categories \nof organizations rate in their top five lists risks tied to a \nperceived lack of skills needed for their adoption of digital \ntechnologies. Smaller organizations may face greater \nhurdles in embracing emerging innovation as they compete \nfor talent to help them leverage the advantages and value \nproposition offered by new technological advancements.\nSmaller organizations may face \ngreater hurdles in embracing emerging \ninnovation as they compete for talent \nto help them leverage the advantages \nand value proposition offered by new \ntechnological advancements.\n56\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later 2034 risk issues\nThe differences in perceptions about long-term risk \nconditions relative to near-term risk concerns for 2024 \nare striking. Across all sizes of organizations, respondents \nrate their top five long-term risks at higher levels than \ntheir 2024 outlooks. In each of the four size categories, \nrespondents rate all top five risks at \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d \nlevels, suggesting that their concerns about 2034 are \nat a higher risk level relative to their near-term risk \nconcerns. Additionally, the two smaller size categories of \norganizations rate all of their top five risks higher than \ntheir assessments of long-term risks in last year\u2019s study. \nClearly, respondents are expressing greater pause about \nlong-term outlooks this year relative to those outlooks last \nyear. This is not surprising. In an era of disruptive change, \nleaders must think in terms of multiple scenarios and how \nthey may play out over time. While this thinking facilitates \npreparedness and a more robust strategic outlook among \norganizations, it also highlights their uncertainty in facing \nthe future, often escalating perceptions of strategic and \nmacroeconomic risks and, interestingly, even operational \nrisks such as cyber threats and talent challenges.\nTechnology-themed concerns dominate the list of top \nrisks for a decade from now. All sizes of organizations \nrate cyber threats as a top five risk, with all except the \nvery largest size category rating that concern as their \nnumber one risk issue. Concerns about the ability to adopt \nemerging digital technologies also is in the top five risks \nfor all organizations, and risks related to the rapid speed \nof disruptive innovations enabled by new and emerging \ntechnologies made the top five risks for all sizes of \norganizations, except the smallest size category. \nTalent concerns also remain a top risk for all sizes of \norganizations, as each category includes concerns \nrelated to their ability to attract, develop and retain \ntalent, including succession challenges, as a top five risk. \nUncertainty about heightened regulatory changes and \nscrutiny is top of mind for the two largest size categories \nof organizations, especially for the largest organizations \n(revenues of $10 billion or higher), which rank that \nconcern as their top risk issue for 2034. Only the smallest \norganizations highlight concerns about privacy and data \nsecurity and concerns about economic conditions as top \nfive long-term risk challenges.\nFigures 5-8 summarize the top-rated risks by size of \norganization separately for 2024 and 2034.

risks they rated as \n\u201cSignificant Impact.\u201d Board members decreased their \n\u201cSignificant Impact\u201d risks from four in 2023 to zero in 2024. \nOther groups also report declines in \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d risks \nafter the heightened concern over the two previous years. \nCEOs report zero risks at the highest impact level, down from \nfive in 2023 and 11 in 2022. Somewhat surprisingly, CFOs \nreport nine of the 36 risks as \u201cLess Significant Impact,\u201d more \nthan any other executive group. These results help explain the \nslight decrease in the overall magnitude and severity results \nfor 2024 relative to the prior year. \nWhile there is some consistency, there are also noticeable \ndifferences in views about 2024 risk conditions across \nexecutive type. Most positions (eight of 10) identify \nconcerns related to attracting and developing talent and to \nthe economy as top five risks. Interestingly, CHROs did not \ninclude concerns related to attracting talent as a top five \nrisk concern. CSOs and CDOs are the only two positions to \nnot identify the economy as a top five risk issue.\nThere is general agreement in the relative significance \namong specific risks between CEOs and board members, \ngiven that all of the 36 risks are rated at the \u201cPotential \nImpact\u201d level (4.51 through 5.99) by both groups, except \nfor one risk that CEOs rate at the \u201cLess Significant Impact\u201d \nlevel (4.50 or lower). There is general agreement among \nboards and CEOs in the top five risks, given that four of the \ntop five risks are the same for both positions. \nCFOs have somewhat differing views about the top risks \ncompared to boards and CEOs, given that CFOs, unlike \nthese other two groups, highlight concerns related to labor \ncosts and the changing current interest rate environment \nas top five risk issues. CFOs are the most optimistic about \n2024 \u2014 they rate nine of the 36 risks at the \u201cLess Significant \nImpact\u201d level. Unlike board members and CFOs, CEOs \nidentify risks related to heightened regulatory changes and \nscrutiny among their top five risk issues for 2024.\n69\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later For 2024, only CHROs, CROs and CAEs view any of the risks \nat the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level. Interestingly, however, there \nis variation across those three groups as to the nature of \nthe risks at that level, suggesting they see differences in the \nrelative significance of specific risks. The one exception is \nthird-party risks, which CROs, CAEs and CHROs all rate at \nthe \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level.\nAs noted earlier, varying perspectives among executives \nand directors call for more discussion among executive \nmembers in order to better understand how each group \nviews the risk landscape and obtain a clearer view of the \norganization\u2019s risk profile.\n2034 risk issues\nFor a decade out (2034), overall risk perceptions exhibit \nsignificant variation relative to 2024. Board members rate \nthree of their top five risk issues at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d \nlevel, while CEOs, CFOs and CROs rate none of their top \nfive risks at that level. CAEs have the most concern about \nthe future, rating 15 risks at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level, \nincluding eight of the 14 operational risks. Further, CAEs \nrate all top five risks at 7.0 or higher. This is significantly \nmore than any other executive group. On the other hand, \nonly CFOs rate more than one risk as having a \u201cLess \nSignificant Impact\u201d in 2034. Overall, the 2034 results show \nan increase in risk concerns for 2034 relative to the short-\nterm risk concerns summarized above. \nThere is general agreement in the long-term top five \nrisks for boards and CEOs, with technology-themed risks \ncomprising three of their top five issues. Additionally, \nall positions \u2014 except CFOs \u2014 include cyber threats as \na top five risk, with six of 10 positions rating that risk in \nthe number one or two position for long-term risk issues. \nEight of the 10 positions also include concerns about the \nadoption of digital technologies requiring skills in short \nsupply as a top five risk issue a decade from now. Six of \n10 positions include concerns about the rapid speed of \ndisruptive innovation as a long-term top five risk issue. \nTechnology- and innovation-related risks are a common \ntheme for long-term horizons.\nTable 11 shows a summary of the impact assessments for \neach of the 36 risks for both 2024 and 2034 to highlight \ndifferences in views about individual risks across different \nexecutive positions.\nVarying perspectives among \nexecutives and directors call \nfor more discussion among \nexecutive members in order to \nbetter understand how each \ngroup views the risk

Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later Figures 10-19 on the following pages highlight the top \nfive risks identified by board members and each executive \nposition (collectively referred to as \u201cleadership positions\u201d). \nFor 2024, eight of the 10 leadership positions (except \nfor CHROs and CDOs) rank concerns about succession \nchallenges and the ability to attract and retain top talent \nalong with uncertainty regarding current economic \nconditions in their top five risks for 2024. Succession \nchallenges and retaining top talent is rated the top risk by \nboard members and CFOs, while CEOs, CHROs and OCS \nposition groups list concerns about economic conditions \nas their top risk. Unease about the organization\u2019s ability \nto manage cyber threats, such as ransomware and other \nattacks, is also recognized by six of the position groups. \nFor 2024, CHROs, CROs and CAEs rate each of their top \nfive risks at the \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level; however, no other \nleadership position group rates any of the top five risks at \nthis level. While most position groups share a number of top \nfive risks, one position group has a unique set of risks. CDOs \nare focused on a distinctive set of risks for 2024, citing \nsocial media developments, data analytics, social issues and \nDEI, geopolitical shifts, and the rising threat of catastrophic \nnatural disasters. CSOs also list three other unique risks \n(all strategic) in their top five rankings. Overall, the results \nreflect how different roles offer varying perspectives when \nassessing risks in disparate environments and over longer \nversus shorter time horizons. \nNineteen of the 36 risks that appear as top five risk \nconcerns for 2024 are cited by at least one of the position \ngroups. Within this collective group of top five risk \nconcerns, there are six of the 10 macroeconomic risks, \neight of the 14 operational risks and five of the 12 strategic \nrisks. Of the three risks cited by at least half of the position \ngroups, two are operational risks and the other is a \nmacroeconomic risk.\nLooking out to 2034, four risks are common top five risks \nacross the majority of position groups: (1) worries that \nthe organization may not be sufficiently prepared to meet \ncyber threats, (2) concerns about succession challenges and \nthe ability to attract and retain top talent, (3) concerns that \nthe adoption of digital strategies will require new skills that \nare in short supply, and (4) concerns about the rapid speed \nof disruptive innovations enabled by new and emerging \ntechnologies and/or other market forces. For 2034, 15 of \nthe 36 risks that appear as top five risks are cited by at least \none of the position groups, with four being macroeconomic, \nfive strategic and six operational.\nThese results prominently reflect the importance of \nbringing varying perspectives to the enterprise risk \nmanagement (ERM) process. Each executive is needed to \nbest identify and assess risks in disparate environments and \nover longer versus shorter time horizons. It is of paramount \nimportance that both the board and management team \nengage in dialogue regarding the most critical enterprise \nrisks, given the different perspectives each brings to the \ntable and the potential for a lack of consensus. Without \nclarity of focus, the executive team may not be aligned both \ninternally and with the board on what the top risks are. \nWorse, they may not be appropriately addressing the most \nimportant risks facing the organization, thereby leaving the \norganization potentially vulnerable to certain risk events.\n76\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later FIGURE 10A\nBoard Members \u2014 2024\nFIGURE 10B\nBoard Members \u2014 2034\nAbility to attract, develop and retain top \ntalent, manage shifts in labor expectations, and \naddress succession challenges \n5.79\n6.01\n5.32\nO\nEconomic conditions, \nincluding inflationary pressures \n5.70\n5.93\n5.39\nM\nCyber threats \n5.64\n5.76\n5.35\nO\nAdoption of digital technologies requiring new \nskills in short supply \n5.51\n5.81\n5.36\nM\nExisting operations and legacy IT infrastructure \nunable to meet performance expectations as \nwell as \u201cborn digital\u201d competitors \n5.51\n5.66\n4.96\nO\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nCyber threats \n6.35\n6.01\n5.36\nO\nAbility to attract, develop and retain top \ntalent, manage shifts in labor expectations, and \naddress succession challenges\n6.17\n6.01\n5.68\nO\nAdoption of digital technologies requiring \nnew skills in short supply \n6.02\n5.92\n5.91\nM\nRapid speed of disruptive innovations enabled \nby new and emerging technologies and/or \nother market forces \n5.94\n6.12\n5.87\nS\nHeightened regulatory changes and scrutiny\n5.94\n5.66\n5.56\nS\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n2024\n2023\n2022\nM Macroeconomic \nRisk Issue\nS Strategic \nRisk Issue\nO Operational \nRisk Issue\n2034\n2033*\n2032*\nM Macroeconomic \nRisk Issue\nS Strategic \nRisk Issue\nO Operational \nRisk Issue\n*\t This data was reported as 2032 and 2031 results, respectively, in our prior year reports.

Similar to \nour analysis summarized earlier in this report, we analyze \nresponses about overall impressions of the magnitude and \nseverity of risks across the eight regions.\nThe scores in Figure 28 reflect responses to the question \nabout the overall impression of the magnitude and severity \nof risks using a 10-point scale where 1 = \u201cExtremely Low\u201d \nand 10 = \u201cExtremely High.\u201d\nGeographic region\nNumber of \nrespondents\nNorth America\n488\nAsia\n128\nAustralia/New Zealand\n88\nIndia\n78\nEurope (includes U.K.)\n187\nLatin America\n99\nMiddle East\n56\nAfrica\n19\nTotal number of respondents\n1,143\n\u201cFour of the eight regions we explore \nreveal heightened overall risk concerns \nfor 2024 relative to the prior year.

Only organizations in \nIndia rate the severity and magnitude of 2024 risks below \n6.0. Four of the eight regions rate the magnitude and severity \nof risks as more severe than 2023, while the remaining \nfour perceive a reduction in the overall magnitude and \nseverity of risks moving from 2023 to 2024. North American \norganizations as well as those from Africa exhibit the largest \nlevel of risk concern for 2024, with both regions rating the \noverall magnitude and severity of risks at 6.50 or higher.\n2024 risk concerns\nFigures 29-36 highlight the top five risks from each of the \neight geographic regions we examine and include the risk \nscores for 2024 and, separately, for 2034, as well as, where \navailable, scores for those risks reported in our 2023 and \n2022 reports. There are noticeable differences in views \nabout risks around the globe, which is especially important \nfor multinational organizations to consider. Fifteen of the \n36 risks appear among the eight geographic regions as top \nfive risks. Operational risks dominate, with at least three of \nthe top five risk issues in each region (with the exception of \nAsia (two)) being operational in nature. \nConsistent with our full sample results, the risks associated \nwith succession and talent acquisition and retention and \neconomic conditions are top of mind for many regions. \nAll eight regions included succession risks and talent \nacquisition and retention in their top five. Six of the eight \nregions similarly include the risk associated with economic \nconditions among their top five risk concerns for 2024. \nOnly two strategic risks are included among the top \nfive for any of the regions in 2024: risks associated with \nregulatory change and enhanced scrutiny, and social media \ndevelopments and platform technology innovations.\n2034 risk issues\nLooking further out into 2034, strategic risks become \nmore heightened for all regions. Fourteen different risks \nappear in the top five across the eight regions, with six of \nthese being strategic risks, four operational risks and four \nmacroeconomic risks. The two most commonly cited top \nfive risks, each appearing in seven of the eight regions, \nare (1) the adoption of digital technologies, with their \nimplications to reskilling and upskilling existing employees; \nand (2) cyber threats. One risk appears in six of the regions\u2019 \ntop five risks for 2034: succession challenges and talent \nacquisition and retention. Finally, one risk appears in four \ntop five lists: the rapid speed of disruptive innovation.\nThere are noticeable differences \nin views about risks around \nthe globe, which is especially \nimportant for multinational \norganizations to consider.\n131\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later FIGURE 29A\nNorth America HQ Organizations \u2014 2024\nFIGURE 29B\nNorth America HQ Organizations \u2014 2034\nEconomic conditions, including \ninflationary pressures \n6.12\n6.10\n5.64\nM\nCyber threats \n6.10\n5.63\n5.67\nO\nAbility to attract, develop and retain top \ntalent, manage shifts in labor expectations, \nand address succession challenges\n6.00\n6.02\n5.91\nO\nIncreases in labor costs \n5.77\n5.98\n5.58\nM\nThird-party risks \n5.76\n5.58\n5.30\nO\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nCyber threats \n6.76\n5.96\n5.69\nO\nAbility to attract, develop and retain top \ntalent, manage shifts in labor expectations, and \naddress succession challenges\n6.45\n6.34\n6.12\nO\nRapid speed of disruptive innovations enabled \nby new and emerging technologies and/or \nother market forces \n6.44\n6.17\n5.88\nS\nHeightened regulatory changes and scrutiny\n6.42\n6.24\n5.91\nS\nAdoption of digital technologies requiring new \nskills in short supply \n6.27\n6.30\n6.21\nM\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n2024\n2023\n2022\nM Macroeconomic \nRisk Issue\nS Strategic \nRisk Issue\nO Operational \nRisk Issue\n2034\n2033*\n2032*\nM Macroeconomic \nRisk Issue\nS Strategic \nRisk Issue\nO Operational \nRisk Issue\n*\t This data was reported as 2032 and 2031 results, respectively, in our prior year reports.

For this year\u2019s report, we provide analyses \nof the separate responses we received from not-for-profit \norganizations and from governmental organizations.23 In prior \nyears we have combined these two into a single category.\nWe analyze responses across these five types of entities to \ndetermine whether different types of organizations rank-\norder risks differently. Similar to our analysis summarized \nearlier, we analyze responses about overall impressions of the \nmagnitude and severity of risks across the five organizational \ntype categories. Again, the scores in Figure 37 reflect \nresponses to the question about the overall impression of the \nmagnitude and severity of risks using a 10-point scale where 1 \n= \u201cExtremely Low\u201d and 10 = \u201cExtremely High.\u201d\nFIGURE 37\nOverall, what is your impression of the magnitude and severity of risks your \norganization will be facing with respect to achieving your performance goals \nover the next 12 months?\nPublic companies\n6.39\n6.35\n6.00\nPrivately held for-profit companies with IPO plans\n6.38\n7.28\n6.91\nPrivately held for-profit companies with no IPO plans\n6.18\n6.93\n6.18\nNot-for-profit organizations\n6.77\nN/A\nN/A\nGovernmental organizations\n6.08\nN/A\nN/A\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n2024\n2023\n2022\n23\t Please note that in addition to this breakout of governmental organizations, we also have a \nbreakout of government industry organizations presented earlier in our report. We distinguish \nthese two groups as follows: Government industry organizations are those that function within a \ngovernment at the national/federal, state or local level (e.g., a government agency). Government \norganizations may be entities that, while under the auspices of a government, operate or identify \nthemselves as part of another industry (e.g., financial services, healthcare). \n140\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later All five entity types agree that the overall magnitude and \nseverity of risks are of a \u201cSignificant Impact\u201d level in 2024, \nwith not-for-profit organizations exhibiting especially \nelevated risk concerns.\nFigures 38-42 highlight the top five risks identified by each \ntype of organization.\n2024 risk concerns\nThe top five risks across the five groups are relatively \nconsistent. All five groups rank succession and talent \nacquisition and retention among their top three risks. In \naddition, economic conditions in markets currently served \nappear in four of the top five risk summaries, as does the \nrisk associated with cyber threats. Third-party risks appear \nin the top five for three of the five groups.\nMacroeconomic and operational risk concerns dominate \nthe top five risk issues for all organizations. Only public \ncompanies include a strategic risk in their top five \u2014 the \nrisk associated with regulatory change and enhanced \nregulatory scrutiny. No other groups include any strategic \nrisk issues in their top five risk concerns for 2024. For all \nbut public companies, at least three of the top five risk \nconcerns are operational risk issues. \nAs noted, within the privately held for-profit category, \nwe captured responses from participants who classified \ntheir respective organizations as either \u201cpreparing to \nbecome publicly held\u201d or \u201cno current plans to become \npublicly held.\u201d Both groups share concerns over economic \nconditions (ranked first for both) and succession and \ntalent acquisition and retention risks (ranked second for \nboth). As well, both groups rate the risk associated with \nthird parties as their fifth-highest risk concern. For private \ncompanies with no plans for an IPO, cyber threats and \nrisks associated with digital technologies and reskilling \ntheir labor force appropriately round out their top five. For \nprivate companies with IPO plans, risks associated with \norganizational culture impacted by the work environment \nand privacy concerns complete their top five risk concerns \nfor 2024.\n2034 risk issues\nThe risk of cyber threats is top of mind, appearing in each \ngroup\u2019s top five risks list and ranked as the number one \nrisk issue for public entities, private entities with IPO plans \nand governmental organizations. There are also significant \nconcerns about succession and talent challenges continuing \ninto the next decade, with that risk issue appearing in four \nof the top five risk summaries for 2034. The adoption of \ndigital technologies and its implications for reskilling and \nupskilling existing employees is also a top five risk concern \nfor four of the five groups \u2014 only private companies with \nIPO plans failed to include this risk in their top five. \nAs well, rapid speed of disruptive innovations enabled by \nadvanced technologies appears as a top five risk for all but \nprivate companies with IPO plans. These firms also exhibit \nthe most variation in their risk concerns for 2034 relative \nto the other groups. Three of the top five risks for private \ncompanies with IPO plans appear only on their top five risks \nlist. All five groups include at least two operational risks and \nthree of the five include at least two strategic risks in their \nlists of top five risk issues looking out a decade.\n141\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later FIGURE 38A\nPublic companies \u2014 2024\nFIGURE 38B\nPublic companies \u2014 2034\n*\t This data was reported as 2032 and 2031 results, respectively, in our prior year reports.

After \nanalyzing the responses received, we \nelected to present those received on \ntwo of the three questions.\nThe first question we selected to \ninclude in this report asked:\nLooking to 2024, are there developments \nor issues that present especially significant \nor out-weighted effects on your business?\nThe words portrayed in the word cloud \non this page capture the essence of \nthe responses received on the above \nquestion.\nInterestingly, the focus of the responses \nis predominantly on significant change in \nthe business and its operations as well as \nkey drivers of change \u2014 regulations, cost \nstructure, interest rates, cybersecurity, \ninflation, supply chains and the economy. \nThe company\u2019s markets, customers and \ncompetition as well as the geopolitical \nenvironment, climate issues and \nlabor markets were also mentioned. \nIn addition, the responses address \nimportant enablers to managing change, \ne.g., strategy, data, technology, systems \nand information.\nThe above themes relate to a number of \nrisks ranked highly in our overall survey \nresults, as previously discussed in this \nreport. Without question, leaders have a \nlot on their minds as they approach 2024. \n147\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later The second question we selected asked:\nAre there any risk issues that are of \nparticular significance to your organization \nor the overall risk environment for 2024 \nand/or 2034?\nThe words portrayed in the word cloud \non this page capture the essence of the \nresponses received on this question.\nThe responses point to a number of \nnear-term and long-term themes \nhighlighted in this report. With respect \nto the long term, that cybersecurity is \ndisplayed prominently is no surprise \nas it was the top risk concern looking \nout 10 years. The responses also refer \nto technology, people, leadership, the \neconomy, the industry, regulations, \nemployees, competition, customers, \noperations, and the geopolitical and \npolitical environments \u2014 issues that \nrelate either directly or indirectly to \nthe top 10 risks for 2034. Reference is \nalso made to climate issues which is the \n13th-rated risk long-term. Interestingly, \nthere are references to population, \ngovernment, DEI and supply sources. \nThese responses, once again, reflect \nwide-ranging issues and challenges \nthat are top of mind for leaders across \nthe globe.\n148\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later Plans to deploy resources to enhance risk management capabilities\nRecall that we asked respondents about their overall \nimpression of the perceived magnitude and severity of risks \nto be faced in 2024. (Note that we did not ask participants \nto consider this for 2034.) As illustrated in Figure 43, the \naverage overall response indicates a perceived decrease in \nthe nature of the overall risk environment, with an average \nscore of 6.35 in 2024 relative to 6.70 in 2023 but higher \nthan the 6.21 reported in 2022. Also, last year we added \na new category of responses received from CHROs, who \nrated the overall magnitude and severity of risks as 8.10 \nin 2023, as compared to the CHRO assessment of 6.02 for \n2024. We believe that the decline in their ratings from 2023 \nto 2024 has contributed to the lower overall assessment in \nmagnitude and severity of 6.70 in 2023 to 6.35 in 2024 for \nthe full sample.\nWe also asked executives to provide insights into whether \ntheir organization plans to devote additional resources \nto improve risk management capabilities over the next \n12 months. We used a 10-point scale, whereby 1 signifies \n\u201cExtremely Unlikely to Make Changes\u201d and 10 signifies \n\u201cExtremely Likely to Make Changes.\u201d\nConsistent with the decrease in the perception of the risk \nenvironment, respondents indicate a lower likelihood of \ndeploying more resources to risk management in 2024 \nrelative to 2023 (and 2022), as reflected by Figure 44.\nFIGURE 43\nMagnitude/severity of risks\n2024\n2023\n2022\n6.35\n6.70\n6.21\n4\n5\n6\n7\nFIGURE 44\nLikely to devote additional resources \nto risk management\n2024\n2023\n2022\n6.21\n6.75\n6.39\n4\n5\n6\n7\nEven with this decline, there continues to be a need to \ninvest in more robust risk management capabilities. The \ndecline is perhaps partially explained by the significant \nincrease in investment that has occurred over the past few \nyears, largely driven by the need to improve organizational \nresilience pursuant to navigating the challenges posed by \nthe pandemic. That experience highlighted the need for \npreparedness and agility as well as demonstrated that \ncompanies can innovate relatively quickly. \n149\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later Organization size analysis\nWe also analyze responses to these questions across \ndifferent sizes of organizations. This year we observe that \nall organizations indicate a decrease in the likelihood of \ngreater investment in risk management resources. As \ndiscussed above for the full sample, we believe this result \nis largely driven by increased investment in prior years, \nleaving little room for continued increases. It is worth \nnoting that the largest organizations are more likely to \ndevote additional resources to risk management relative to \nsmaller-sized organizations.\nFIGURE 45\nHow likely or unlikely is it that your organization will \ndevote additional time and/or resources to enhance its risk \nmanagement capabilities over the next 12 months?\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues $10B or greater\n6.52\n6.70\n6.30\nRevenues $1B through $9.99B\n6.07\n6.72\n6.52\nRevenues $100M through $999M\n6.29\n6.84\n6.53\nRevenues less than $100M\n6.01\n6.84\n6.07\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n150\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later Respondent position analysis\nInterestingly, all positions indicate a decrease in the likelihood of committing enhanced resources to risk management capabilities in 2024. \nOur new group added last year, CHROs, exhibits the largest reduction of likelihood of increased investment in the coming year.

This \nmay simply reflect the increased investments already \nmade in prior years, as noted previously. The Financial \nServices industry group leads in both absolute terms for \n2024 (6.59) and in the magnitude of the decrease from \n2023 expectations, which is relatively small (from 6.79 \nin 2023).

Our respondents reveal \nthat the scope of global risks has become more varied, and \nthe number of different risks rated as top risk concerns is \nonly growing in nature and type. There are noticeable shifts \nin what comprise the top risks for 2024 relative to last year, \nwith many of those risks having a lingering impact that \nmay extend a decade or more, reminding executives that \nrisks are constantly emerging. In addition, the interrelated \nnature of the top risks noted in this year\u2019s survey makes for \nrisk profiles that are nuanced and complex to manage.\nOngoing events continue to present major challenges for \nthe next 12 months. The level of uncertainty in today\u2019s \nmarketplace is rapidly evolving and presenting new risks \nthat many previously thought were unimaginable. The \never-changing risk landscape and the overall perceived \nmagnitude and severity of risks should prompt boards and \nsenior executives to scrutinize closely the approaches their \norganizations use to keep an eye on risks emerging around \nthe corner.\nUnfortunately, some organizations continue to manage \nrisks the way they have for many years, even though the \nprofile of risks is evolving and the frequency and velocity \nof unexpected, disruptive events increase. As business \ntransforms because of the rapidly advancing digital \neconomy, game-changing innovations such as generative \nAI, and shifting geopolitical conditions, the risk profile is \nmost certainly not yesterday\u2019s risks. A focus on financial \nand compliance risks using static analog-age tools without \nany conception of the organization\u2019s risk appetite leaves \ndecision-makers across the organization to their own \ndevices. Soon those organizations may realize, once it\u2019s too \nlate, that their level of investment in risk management and \nwillingness to engage in robust tools to identify, manage \nand monitor risk are inadequate.\nThe focus today is on agility and resilience as much as \nit is on prevention and detection. It is about providing \ninformation for decision-making and enabling the \norganization to be more anticipatory and prepared. Now \nmay be an opportune time for boards and C-suites to \nexamine closely how their organizations approach risk \nmanagement and oversight in the digital age to pinpoint \naspects requiring improvement. \nThe focus today is on agility and \nresilience as much as it is on \nprevention and detection. It is \nabout providing information for \ndecision-making and enabling \nthe organization to be more \nanticipatory and prepared.\n155\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later In the interest of evaluating and improving risk management \ncapabilities in light of the findings in this report, we offer \nexecutives and directors the following diagnostic questions \nto consider when evaluating their organization\u2019s risk \nassessment and risk management processes. A \u201cno\u201d response \nto any of the following questions should be considered as a \npossible area of improvement. These diagnostic questions \nfocus on assessments of these five fundamental elements of \nan effective risk management approach:\n1.\t\nRobustness of risk management in light of the evolving \nbusiness and geopolitical environment\n2.\t\nStrategic positioning of the risk management process\n3.\t\nAccountabilities for ownership of risks\n4.\t\nEffectiveness of board communications about \nenterprisewide risks \n5.\t\nInfluence of leadership and culture on risk management\nSpecific assessment questions for each of these themes are \nprovided below to help guide discussions among executives \nand boards to pinpoint opportunities for risk management \nenhancements.\nDiagnostic theme: Assessing whether \nour risk management approach is \nsufficiently robust in light of our \nevolving business environment\nBecause risks are constantly changing, the risk management \nprocess needs to be repeatable, clearly defined and \nadequately resourced to ensure business leaders receive the \ninformation they need to stay abreast of emerging issues:\n\t\u2022 Is the process supported by an effective, robust \nmethodology that is definable, repeatable and \nunderstood by key stakeholders?\n\t\u2013 Does our approach to risk identification foster \nconsideration of risks that may have a higher- \nlevel strategic impact and that may be triggered \nby external events or competitor actions that are \nbeyond our organization\u2019s control?\n\t\u2013 Does the process delineate the critical enterprise \nrisks from the day-to-day risks of managing the \nbusiness so we are able to focus the C-suite and \nboardroom dialogues on the risks that matter most?\n\t\u2013 Do we engage all the right stakeholders in the risk \nidentification process?\n\t\u2013 Would most stakeholders describe our approach to \nrisk management as one that is dynamic, engaging \nand insightful versus one that is stale, siloed across \ndisparate functions in the organization and/or \nrequiring a refresh?\n\t\u2013 Is our approach appropriately balanced with respect \nto focusing on the macroeconomic, strategic, \nreputational, operational and compliance risks that \nmatter?\n\t\u2013 How extensively do we evaluate the effectiveness of \npreparedness and response plans that are intended \nto either prevent risk events from occurring or \nreduce the impact of risk events should they occur?\n\t\u2022 Is there a process for identifying emerging risks and \ndoes the risk identification process allow the board \nand management sufficient time to consider adequate \nresponse plans to these risks?\n\t\u2022 Does our management dashboard system:\n\t\u2013 Include robust key risk indicators that help the \nleadership team monitor shifts in relevant external \ntrends?\n\t\u2013 Cover the most critical enterprise risks?\n\t\u2013 Provide an effective early warning capability with \naction triggers and decision prompts that enable the \norganization to act as an \u201cearly mover\u201d in response \nto market opportunities and emerging risks?\n156\nprotiviti.com\u2003\n\nExecutive Perspectives on Top Risks for 2024 and a Decade Later Diagnostic theme: Assessing whether \nour risk focus is positioned to provide \nstrategic value\nGiven the pace of change experienced in the industry and \nthe relative riskiness and nature of the organization\u2019s \noperations:\n\t\u2022 Are we centering our focus on risks in the context of our \norganization executing its strategy, achieving its business \nobjectives, sustaining its operations, and preserving its \nbrand image and reputation?\n\t\u2022 Is our leadership\u2019s knowledge of top risks enhanced by \nthe organization\u2019s risk management process serving as a \nvalue-added input to the strategy-setting process?\n\t\u2022 Does our risk management process consider extreme \nas well as plausible scenarios?
