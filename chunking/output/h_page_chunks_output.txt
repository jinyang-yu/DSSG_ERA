Risk Radar 2024
Dare to Prepare
 
November 2023

Welcome to our  
all-new Healix  
annual report,  
Risk Radar 
2024: Dare  
to Prepare
This year, we’re taking a different 
approach to our outlook on risk  
by talking to those on the  
frontline of risk management  
for their organisations. 
We commissioned an external 
research team to speak to risk 
managers, senior security managers 
and travel risk managers at mid-
sized businesses across multiple 
industries. We asked pertinent 
questions around their current 
risk strategies and practices, to 
understand where they perceive 
their priorities and challenges to lie. 
In total, we received 500 responses 
across Construction, Energy & 
Mining, Financial and Professional 
Services, Higher Education, 
Technology, Manufacturing,  
Media and Entertainment and  
Not-for-Profit.
We collated responses across 20 
questions and this report features 
key findings from the data, pulling  
out three themes that we believe  
to be the most revealing. We also  
share insight into these risk factors 
to underpin strategic decision 
making, while also taking a deep  
dive into regional pictures for the 
next twelve months.

Management Services
Director’s view - 
The assault by Hamas from the Gaza 
Strip into Israel in October 2023, 
marked by a barrage of attacks 
and hostage-taking, took us all by 
surprise. Healix swiftly activated its 
Incident Management Team (IMT) to 
assist those clients seeking our help, 
from advice to evacuation.
Fresh in the memory is the Wagner 
Group plane crash in August that 
same year. The loss of three senior 
influential leaders, including head of 
the organisation, Yevgeny Prigozhin,  
along with three other key figures 
crucial to operations, highlights 
a critical concern within risk 
management – the concentration of 
key personnel in a single, vulnerable 
situation. This incident illustrates 
that no organisation, no matter how 
experienced or assured, is immune 
to risk. 
These global events, whether 
directly affecting us or not, serve  
as a salient reminder to revisit our  
own plans and procedures. Are they 
still fit for purpose? When was the 
last time we stress-tested them?  
Do we have relevant and appropriate 
risk mitigations in place? The 
importance of preparing for the 
unexpected cannot be overstated. 
Healix’s IMT, tried and tested through 
numerous activations, stands as 
testament to that. Recent responses 
to Afghanistan, Ukraine, Sudan 
and now Israel underscores the 
fact that complacency is not a risk 
management strategy, and we work 
hard to ensure that we are properly 
prepared and ready for whatever 
happens.
A year ago, we highlighted the 
surprisingly low awareness of the 
best practice guidance, ISO 31030. 
Now two years since its publication, 
with business travel continuing 
to rise, our recent survey has 
highlighted a significant increase, 
with 76% of respondents reporting 
they have now reviewed their 
travel and people risk management 
programme in line with ISO 31030.
Of equal importance is the 
recognition of the role of personal 
risk profile, on par with more 
traditional risk factors like security 
risk environment, availability and 
quality of medical care, and nature 
of activities. Our survey reveals 
that grappling with personalised 
risk remains a challenge, despite 
many respondents acknowledging 
its critical role in the incidents that 
they have managed. This is already 
something we’re responding to – 
evolving our recently launched Healix 
Travel Safe to encompass other 
personal risk factors and associated 
risk mitigation measures. 
I hope you find the report insightful 
and that it gives pause for thought 
on the priorities for risk management 
planning in 2024.
In the world of risk management, the only constant is 
change and I am reminded of the familiar phrase  
“no plan survives first contact with the enemy”.  
This maxim is apt in the face of recent global events.

Now it’s 
personal
This high-powered assembly  
serves as a testament to the  
growing recognition of the 
significance of personalised risk 
assessment within our increasingly 
complex operating landscape.
Personalising the risk assessment 
process adds an extra layer of 
protection, departing from the 
outdated ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. 
It embraces nuance and recognises 
the distinctive circumstances and 
characteristics of each traveller. 
Factors like demographic profiles, 
mental and physical health, and 
travel experience play a pivotal 
role in shaping individual risk 
exposure and perceived safety 
levels. In essence, this approach 
enables an organisation to tailor 
its risk management strategies to 
suit each traveller, enhancing their 
effectiveness in mitigating and 
managing travel-related risks.
As part of our research, we sought to 
gauge how businesses incorporate 
personal risk profiles into their 
risk assessments. Interestingly, 
80% of our survey respondents 
reported having managed incidents 
linked to a traveller’s personal 
risk profile. However, only 39% of 
these same individuals integrated 
personal profiles into their travel risk 
assessments. Why this discrepancy?
Our roundtable discussions 
highlighted a common challenge: 
collecting and using sensitive data 
without breaching trust. Employees 
may be hesitant to share personal 
information, making it vital to 
demonstrate the benefits of  
opting in. In essence, the more 
information shared, the safer and 
better informed travellers can be. 
This isn’t just about data security;  
it’s a shared effort to enhance  
safety and improve the overall  
travel experience.
At a recent roundtable event, we had the privilege 
of hosting speakers from PwC and the BBC to 
delve into the realm of personalised travel risk. 
Among the attendees were prominent business 
leaders from industry giants such as Apple,  
Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, and Meta.

Travel 
with pride
Gender identity and sexual orientation 
are increasingly becoming key factors in 
personal risk profiles. Many countries still 
criminalise individuals based on these 
preferences, warranting careful consideration 
for travellers visiting such regions.
Our research uncovered that in the 
Higher Education sector, gender 
identity and sexual orientation rank 
as the primary factors impacting a 
traveller’s personal risk profile. This 
industry is commonly associated with 
being an advocate for progressive 
change and ally-ship, and a safe  
place for students to openly express 
their identity. They also host a 
significant number of Generation  
Z students, where one-in-five Gen 
Z adults identify as LGBTQ+ and an 
expectation for these numbers to 
continue to rise each year.
Legislative changes worldwide 
continually impact LGBTQ+ 
travellers, who face a multitude  
of legal, social, and cultural risks 
when journeying across the globe. 
For instance, Canada recently 
updated its travel advisory, warning 
its LGBTQ+ citizens about the 
potential impact of US laws on their 
travels. Examples like this underscore 
the nuanced nature of personal risk 
profiles, emphasising the importance 
of understanding the legal and 
cultural landscapes employees may 
encounter to mitigate risks effectively.

Setting a 
standard
The prominence of personal risk takes centre stage 
within the ISO 31030 guidance, a pivotal framework 
that emphasises that effective travel risk management 
extends beyond having an understanding of 
environmental risk factors alone.
Introduced two years ago,  
ISO 31030 serves as benchmark 
for businesses, applying to a broad 
spectrum of organisations and 
various risk scenarios. But how 
seriously are businesses taking it?
A notable shift in awareness is 
evidenced in our research, with a 
noteworthy 76% of respondents 
indicating that they have reviewed 
their travel risk management 
programmes in alignment with  
ISO 31030. 
Back in April last year, a survey 
by Business Travel Show Europe 
highlighted that most travel buyers 
remained unaware of ISO 31030, 
so our results suggest it is gaining 
momentum. The Global Business 
Travel Association (GBTA), for 
instance, now features a request 
for proposal (RFP) template with 
a central focus on ISO 31030, 
underscoring its increasing 
relevance to business. 
Our research further reveals that 
the varied adoption of ISO 31030 
across sectors can be attributed to 
timing. For instance, while Energy 
and Mining sectors show a review 
rate of only 59%, Manufacturing and 
Construction sectors are leading 
with impressive percentages of 
96% and 84%, respectively. The 
divergence in adoption timelines 
reflects unique industry dynamics.
In the case of Oil and Gas 
companies, operating to ISO 31030 
standards for over 20 years as 
common practice – their risk appetite 
is an intrinsic part of everyday 
culture, so they are less exposed. 
Other sectors are perhaps now 
catching up. 
The future of ISO 31030 holds 
promise. As adoption continues to 
expand, it’s only a matter of time 
before it transitions from guidance to 
an industry standard. But regardless 
of whether compliance becomes  
a legal requirement or not,  
ISO 31030 sets a universal 
benchmark, signifying that now  
is the ideal time to integrate it  
into operational frameworks.

A natural 
threat
Numerous studies this year, including 
from PwC, have pointed to cyber 
security as the biggest operational 
risk keeping business leaders 
awake at night. Yet we are now 
seeing extreme weather perceived 
as the most tangible and long-term 
business risk.
The near constant reporting of 
wildfires and flooding across the 
world in the last twelve months 
will be a defining factor. From the 
wildfires of Hawaii and Canada, to 
the 50-degree Celsius temperatures 
in South America and flooding in 
China, many of the major events 
recently experienced in the world 
have been related to climate risk. 
According to a study by Nature 
Medicine, nearly 62,000 people  
died of heat-related deaths last  
year during Europe’s hottest  
summer on record.
As a global trend, the common  
theme of all climate-related risks is 
that they are indiscriminate and lead 
to tangible risks, whether physical 
risk to staff or operational risks such 
as infrastructure and supply chain 
disruption. 
The tangibility of risks has a 
significant role in these figures too. 
Extreme weather has a more direct 
and immediate physical impact than 
a cyber attack, which may have 
economic and reputational risk  
but is unlikely to cause loss of life.
We asked organisations what they 
considered to be the biggest risk to their 
operations by 2030. It was interesting, 
and somewhat surprising, to see that 
extreme weather is ranked first. 
Although relatively closely matched

Close  
to home
Proximity also has a role to play. As extreme 
weather events continue to escalate, disasters 
are more likely to occur on our own doorstep. 
Personal experience is a sure-fire way to 
heighten awareness in global populations.
It is on the radar for companies now 
as it comes to the forefront of our 
own experiences. This is echoed  
in our research which found that 
almost three quarters (73%)  
of organisations say that they  
have been directly affected by 
extreme weather. 
The highest impacted industry 
is Manufacturing (86%) where 
operations are dispersed across 
numerous physical environments 
and geographies. Media also 
ranked (83%) high in impact, which 
accounts for the risks involved in 
reporting on these extreme weather 
events at source.
Combine this more direct experience 
with the macro trends, extreme 
weather events and the devastating 
effects are only going to increase. 
We run the very real risk of failing 
to meet the United Nations goals of 
reducing emissions by 45% by 2030 
and reaching net zero by 2050.
Healix
12

The heat 
is on
Of all the extreme weather 
events, the most concerning 
risk is extreme heat for 41% 
of organisations polled.  
The second and third 
biggest concerns are  
heavy rainfall and flooding 
(37%) and wildfires (33%).
This makes sense because not only 
can extreme heat affect personnel 
through conditions such as 
heatstroke and severe dehydration 
but it can also lead to associated 
factors related to extreme heat,  
such as wildfires.  
 
Although extreme heat can be one 
of the easiest extreme weather risks 
to mitigate operationally, this can 
depend on operational environments 
and any extenuating circumstances.  
For example, extreme heat will cause 
a high demand for electricity for 
cooling systems, which can cause 
poor outages in certain locations and 
that could make it hard to mitigate 
the extreme heat risks for a company.
Healix

A bleak 
forecast?
We asked organisations to tell us the risks 
that would have the most impact on their 
operations and natural disaster came out 
highest (34%) ahead of societal/cultural (30%).
This fits with the other results we’ve 
seen from the report. However, when 
we looked to the future, 25% said 
that they don’t have plans in place  
to mitigate risk around climate  
or sustainability.
This is concerning as we’ve already 
identified that it is one of the biggest 
risks on a macro level. What used to 
be latent and perceived as a longer-
term risk, has now become a central 
part of business continuity plans.  
We are experiencing more 
immediate physical and direct 
operational impacts. 
‘25% said that they 
don’t have plans in 
place to mitigate risk 
around climate or 
sustainability.’
It is crucial that organisations begin 
to incorporate climate risk into  
day-to-day risk management plans, 
as the risks posed to personnel 
are becoming more tangible.
Our research asked respondents 
to look at the risks they are most 
concerned about in the next two 
to ten years. There are certainly 
different risks highlighted between 
the two time-frames, but the  
second most concerned risk  
across both is natural disasters  
and extreme weather. 
What do we take from this?  
You could say it shows an apathy 
and lack of confidence in resolving 
climate-related risks. Or you could 
believe that organisations now 
accept that this is a long-term issue. 
Our sense is that for the majority it is 
the latter and that there is an appetite 
for change, not just mitigation.
Climate risks cover a wide range  
of potential incidents, from extreme 
heat to deadly hurricanes, so there 
isn’t a ‘one-size-fits-all’ rule for 
mitigating these risks. In general, 
organisations should ensure 
actionable and tested plans are 
in place for any potential extreme 
weather event, such as authoring 
evacuation plans, establishing 
primary and secondary methods 
of communication and ensuring 
personnel, assets and sites are 
equipped with the necessary 
protective equipment.

The rise 
of AI
As part of developing this research report,  
we were keen to take a look at the appetite 
and adoption of AI in travel risk management. 
Almost three quarters (72%) of those 
surveyed said that they are likely 
to integrate AI into their travel risk 
management processes in the next 
six to twelve months. These are big 
numbers and the appetite is clearly 
there. Organisations want to use it, 
but the reality is that many just don’t 
know how as of yet. 
The evolution of AI technology 
has been rapid in the last year, but 
the sense is that organisations are 
taking their time to make sure they 
are comfortable with integrating 
it into their processes. There is 
the reputational risk of using it too 
quickly and for problems to occur. 
We are yet to see any high-profile 
failures resulting from the use of 
AI that might put the brakes on 
widespread adoption.
The prediction is that the fast pace 
of change will continue, but in the 
meantime, organisations are still 
figuring out the opportunities and the 
risks, in other words, the unknowns. 
Forbes UK research suggested 
that 42% of us are still wary of 
a dependence on AI and loss of 
human skills, and AI will need to be 
able to demonstrate another level of 
value before its adoption becomes 
commonplace.
‘According to government research, 
around one in six UK organisations 
have embraced at least one 
element of AI technology already 
and our results echoed this trend.’
Healix

Trust  
vs risk
There’s minimal risk in using it as a 
search engine and it can be a very 
useful jumping off point for ideas  
and as one information source 
amongst others. 
It is true to say that there is some risk 
however, in that information sources 
are not qualified. There is some 
unconscious bias too, borne out 
of the potential dataset limitations 
and sources. Nevertheless, there is 
limited risk to your organisation using 
it in this way. 
Our research echoes this view, 
revealing AI (32%) as the second 
most utilised source of information 
related to business travel after Travel 
Management Companies (39%). 
In this question, AI also came out 
higher than third-party assistance 
providers, social media, government 
agencies, keyword alerts, news 
outlets and aggregators. Perhaps the 
most interesting observation here 
is that risk managers are preferring 
to use AI for intelligence gathering 
over government or news sources. 
Ease and speed of usage can 
account for its desirability, but it also 
demonstrates a level of trust already 
in AI as a valid source of intelligence.
Much of the appetite in the last year has been 
built around the more ‘descriptive’ use of AI 
technology as an additional information source or 
a more sophisticated version of a search engine. 
Healix

Where’s  
my data?
The promise is that we can move to a more 
‘generative’ use of AI, where we could use it for 
process verification, right up to the development 
of automated risk management tools.
But the stumbling block is around trust -  
‘generative use’ of AI involves inputting 
data and that opens a Pandora’s box of 
questions around how that data is being 
manipulated. What about GDPR and the 
security of servers? The UK and other 
overseas markets are also not prepared  
for these developments from a  
regulatory standpoint. 
As we use AI more, the potential for distrust 
increases because the risks are greater. 
Only time will tell, but one surety is that it 
won’t be long before we understand AI’s 
full potential. Artificial intelligence tools 
are best used in conjunction with more 
traditional intelligence gathering, so that 
it can be verified using other sources to 
ensure accuracy and reliability. With the 
rise of generative AI, internal processes 
should be developed regarding the input of 
private or personal data and configuration 
of any AI-generated software. 
‘In the 2023 budget, 
the UK government 
committed almost  
£1 billion of government 
funding towards  
AI research.’

Middle East & 
North Africa
These results are not surprising, 
given regional developments 
over recent years. In previous 
years, we may have seen Islamist 
insurgencies receive a higher vote, 
but the decreased capabilities 
of groups such as al-Qaeda and 
Islamic State have reduced this 
perception of threat. Autocratic rule 
is also a constant when it comes to 
perceptions of risk in this region.
These results were collected 
before the Hamas assault in Israel, 
a complex and destructive attack 
which has wide-ranging implications 
for civilians in Israel, the Palestinian 
territories and the wider Middle East. 
The emergent Israel and Hamas 
conflict contains elements of all three 
biggest risks for the MENA region. 
Geopolitical tensions between rival 
MENA states can lead to obstacles 
to effective business practice at 
short notice, which is likely why 
diverse business sectors listed this 
as their biggest risk. Sanctions and 
restrictions on imports and exports 
can be imposed without significant 
forewarning, while conflicts and 
political instability can result in  
price spikes in commodities.
For Energy and Mining, it is 
unsurprising that Islamist 
insurgencies are ranked as the top 
risk. Al-Qaeda and Islamic State  
have energy infrastructure as a 
priority target for operations, likely 
due to their importance for state 
stability. This is the case in Algeria, 
which witnessed the large-scale  
al-Qaeda attack on the Tigantourine 
gas facility in Amenas in 2013, and 
Iraq, Syria and Egypt, which sees 
semi-regular attacks on energy 
infrastructure by Islamic State 
affiliated groups.
The ebb and flow of fast-moving 
political developments across the 
region often results in significant 
tensions between nations, 
occasionally bordering on outright 
hostility. While 2023 saw an ease 
in the Saudi Arabia-Iran rivalry, 
significant tensions remain that  
could derail the progress made 
in bilateral relations, not least 
any potential Iranian direction or 
influence over the Hamas assault  
in Israel. 
Deep and long-lasting political 
issues remain across the region, 
including the status of the Palestinian 
territories in the aftermath of the 
Hamas-Israel conflict, political Islam 
and political schisms and conflict in 
Syria and Libya, which will continue 
to drive regional relations over the 
coming twelve months.

Europe  
& CIS 
By James Towndrow,  
Regional Intelligence Analyst (ECIS)
The Russian invasion of Ukraine, 
adding to the residual impacts of 
the Covid-19 pandemic, is the main 
driver underlying the risks facing 
organisations across Europe. High 
energy prices and slowed economic 
growth, traceable to the conflict, 
demonstrate the capacity for major 
geopolitical risk factors to disrupt 
global supply chains and impact 
consumer spending. Widespread 
economic and political impacts 
associated with the conflict have 
forced governments to adopt tighter 
monetary policies, in turn prompting 
the reconsideration of existing 
climate goals. 
High inflation slowed economic 
growth, and the increase in interest 
rates as a result of wider geopolitical 
risk factors is likely to undermine 
investor confidence. Impacts are 
likely to be felt in sectors including 
manufacturing and construction. 
The current trajectory of fighting 
in Ukraine points to a protracted 
conflict. European sanctions against 
Russia have dented but failed to 
derail the Russian economy, with the 
Kremlin orientating spending with a 
view to sustaining military operations 
in Ukraine well into 2024 and  
likely beyond. 
Domestic governments are likely to 
orientate policy towards navigating 
further economic turbulence over the 
coming winter. Concerns regarding 
supply drops in the availability of  
Russian natural gas, increased global 
demand for liquefied natural gas 
(LNG) and the possibility of more 
severe winter conditions in Europe 
add to continued uncertainty ahead 
of the upcoming winter. 
We asked respondents to identify the biggest 
risks for Europe CIS in the next twelve months and 
macroeconomic risk (52%) followed by energy supply 
(51%) and Russia-Ukraine conflict (46%) were ranked 
the highest.

Americas
Narcotics organisations are the 
main risk as precedent suggests 
their operations are liable to pose 
a direct risk to lives either through 
targeting rival criminal groups, the 
security forces, or civilians in cases 
of indiscriminate violence. 
The risks associated with political 
violence take place amid election 
cycles that rely increasingly more 
on social media for exchanging 
information, which leads to further 
polarisation, dissemination of  
fake news and organised protests. 
Corruption remains a priority risk 
as countries in the region face 
challenges to develop efficient 
methods of accountability and 
checks-and-balances systems.  
The problem is accentuated by slow 
and inefficient judicial systems and 
limited economic growth, which 
means that politicians and low-level 
bureaucrats are more likely to  
take risks.
The presence of drug-related 
violence increases kidnapping rates 
and criminality. The security forces 
are commonly under-equipped and 
badly trained, which means that 
narcotic groups can extort the local 
population with minimal resistance. 
Their influence and power will grow 
as their main source of income - drug 
trafficking - is unlikely to decrease. 
A deterioration of the security risk 
environment in Ecuador is likely 
to destabilise the region. The 
country’s strategic location along 
drug smuggling corridors that come 
from Peru and Bolivia and continue 
through Colombia and Central 
America means that turf wars  
will increase.
Energy companies in the Americas, 
particularly in Mexico, consider 
narcotic groups their biggest risks  
as oil theft continues to occur in 
the Red Triangle region. Media 
companies understand the risks 
posed by these organisations as 
investigative journalists are liable  
to be assassinated. As these groups 
control vast territories in isolated 
areas, media companies will require 
dedicated security support to  
film or study animals/plants in  
high-risk regions.

Asia Pacific
Food insecurity in the Asia Pacific 
region has been significantly 
exacerbated due to the impacts of 
the Ukraine war and the increased 
propensity of climate-induced 
disasters and extreme weather 
events. Even though an escalation 
in the Taiwan Strait and the Korean 
Peninsula is unlikely to materialise, 
heightened tensions can pose 
operational risks to businesses in the 
region due to their potential impact 
on supply chains and regional trade.
Key drivers of food insecurity in the 
region include rising global food 
prices, increased fertiliser and fuel 
prices, supply chain disruptions, 
devalued local currencies and limited 
capacity for social safety nets, 
following slowed economic growth 
after Covid-19. 
Extreme weather events, such as 
floods and droughts, have increased 
in frequency and exacerbate the 
problem due to their detrimental 
effect on crop yields and harvesting, 
livestock and agricultural 
infrastructure.
Countries most at risk of food 
insecurity include Afghanistan, 
Bangladesh, Laos, Myanmar, 
Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the 
Pacific Islands, mainly due to their 
socio-economic environments, 
dependence on agriculture and 
exposure to climate-induced natural 
disasters. The increasing food 
insecurity risks in APAC are likely  
to increase supply chain disruptions 
and deteriorate political stability 
in affected regions due to the 
propensity of food insecurity to  
lead to political violence.

Intelligence Analyst (APAC)
Elsewhere, China has significantly 
increased its military activities in the 
Taiwan Strait, with unprecedented 
daily incursions by Chinese aircraft 
near Taiwan. The persistence of 
provocative actions by North Korea, 
combined with the increasingly 
defensive responses by South Korea 
and Japan, highlights a deteriorating 
trend in the Korean Peninsula.
We asked respondents to identify the biggest 
risks for the Asia Pacific region in the next twelve 
months and food insecurity (50%), China/Taiwan 
tensions (47%), North Korea hostility (44%) were 
the top three ranked.

Africa 
(ex. North Africa) 
By Tess Daniel, 
Senior Security Analyst
The spread of militancy in Africa has been evident 
in the past year with a marked 68% increase in 
fatalities involving civilians. The militant Islamist 
threat is not monolithic but comprised of over a 
dozen different militant groups operating largely 
within the Sahel and Somalia. In the Sahel, 
the Islamist violence has rapidly expanded in 
casualties and geographically, spreading from 
Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger into neighbouring 
countries such as Ghana, Togo and Benin. 
The past year has seen a continuation of the 
trend of military takeovers that started in recent 
years. Since 2020, there have been ten attempted 
coups, mostly in West and Central Africa, 
underscoring a rapid undoing of democratic 
systems in the region. This is largely reflective 
of long-standing frustration with civilian leaders 
in Africa. Several countries are now ruled by 
transitional military authorities, including Burkina 
Faso, Chad, Gabon, Guinea, Mali, Niger,  
and Sudan.
Meanwhile, long-standing international partners, 
such as the United States and France, have lost 
some of their influence in Africa to the benefit 
of new partners such as Russia. With the help 
of the Wagner mercenary group, Moscow is 
successfully inserting itself in countries such as 
Mali and Burkina Faso and is taking advantage of 
Western policy missteps, growing anti-European 
sentiment, and long-standing failures  
of international and local actors to address  
the root causes of regional instability.
The three identified risks are interrelated,  
as most of the political instability that preceded 
regime changes was linked to deteriorating 
security situations amid the spread of militancy. 
The series of coups and the growing influence 
of authoritarian governments like Russia and 
China is indicative of a broader global turn away 
from democracy. The expansion of militant 
threats, combined with political instability and 
the influence of Russia, is creating growing 
operational risks for companies with a footprint  
in the Sahel. 
‘The past year 
has seen a 
continuation 
of the trend 
of military 
takeovers 
that started in 
recent years.’
We asked respondents to identify the biggest risks for 
Africa in the next twelve months and the spread of militancy 
(54%), followed by regime changes (49%) and Russia/China 
influence (44%) were the top three ranked.

Relevant, corroborated and up-to-
date information plays a key part  
in effective risk identification.  
Stay abreast of the latest 
developments using data from 
multiple reliable sources, and be 
wary of misinformation. External 
suppliers or embedded analysts 
can be valuable for managing 
the collection and analysis of 
intelligence, identifying new or 
evolving risks and monitoring long 
term trends on your behalf, where 
you may lack the in-house resource.
It is essential to develop comprehensive plans to extract your staff from challenging 
operating environments. Your plan should look at your staff exposure, infrastructure, 
routes, ports of departure, operational issues, and the escalation point ‘triggers’ that 
signal a deterioration in the specific environment.
This should involve forecasting potential crises specific to your 
organisation and developing plans around how to deal with them. 
The process includes the identification of the characteristics of a 
crisis and subsequent intervention in order to minimise reputational, 
financial, operational or legal risks and facilitate recovery.
When we write travel risk policies, we account for your business 
culture, risk tolerance, operational footprint, countries of travel and 
management framework, and provide a travel risk policy unique to 
your organisation. The policy and recommendations consider the 
three stages of travel: before, during and after, and are informed by a 
thorough review of risks that your workforce could be exposed to.
Leveraging ground support and 
protective services ensures the safety 
of your staff, executives and loved ones 
to enable them to travel with confidence. 
It is important to assess the threat and 
risk environment, and find solutions 
in an individualised security plan, 
scaled to accommodate your different 
environments and risk appetites.
Building a personalised risk profile 
requires a strong bond of trust between 
business and traveller. In order to 
make sure risk profiles are robust 
and effective, businesses must find 
honest and transparent ways to gather 
sensitive personal information from 
employees, while making every effort 
to keep that information secure and 
prevent it from falling into the wrong 
hands. This process, while complex,  
is crucial to ensuring that each traveller 
is equipped with the knowledge and 
resources they need to navigate their 
own unique risk experience.
