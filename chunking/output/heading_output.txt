PwC | Managing risk in higher education

=== Introduction and scope


=== The focus on resilience has also moved away from 
withstanding one off shocks, to being confident that 
institutions can thrive regardless of the challenges that 
arise. This is, of course not isolated to the HE sector, as 
PwC’s recent rethink risk/rethink resilience thought 
leadership has shown  Find out more here.


=== Financial sustainability


=== All of the risk registers we reviewed included risks 
around the medium to long term financial sustainability 
of institutions. This is not a surprise, given that 
challenges in this area have been noted in our 
previous analyses, but our 2023 analysis showed that 
institutions have greater concerns about balancing 
increasing costs with flat revenue streams. This 
uncertainty means that institutions are having to pay 
closer attention to balancing the need to invest with a 
requirement to maintain cash reserves. At the same 
time, student demands are increasing, it’s becoming 
more challenging to make a return on research, and 
the competition for students is increasing 
exponentially, particularly internationally.


=== What’s clear is that management are now 
increasing their scrutiny over investment cases and 
demanding better and quicker returns on 
investment. In some cases, financial controls over 
budgeting, budget monitoring and expenditure 
processes have been enhanced. Whether this will 
be sufficient to mitigate against an institutional 
failure is yet to be seen, but many in the sector 
expect that regulatory action may be needed to 
prevent this in the near future.


=== Environmental sustainability


=== Our analysis also showed that institutions are worried 
about the impact of climate change and the work 
required to meet Net Zero targets. The HE sector is 
increasingly seen as being key to solving 
environmental sustainability challenges, especially 
given the academic talent and focus of research for 
many institutions.


=== Whilst scope one (direct emissions from owned 
sources) and scope two (indirect emissions from 
purchased energy) emissions have been relatively 
straightforward for the sector to calculate and 
develop plans to reduce, scope three (indirect) 
emissions have proved much more difficult. Our 
analysis also noted that some institutions have 
found it challenging to obtain the funding for plans 
to reduce carbon emissions and gaining buy-in 
from the whole organisation has been difficult. The 
estate clearly has a huge role to play in reducing 
carbon emissions and some institutions have a 
number of old buildings, which were not built with 
sustainability in mind.


=== The Higher Education (HE) sector has faced 
another year where the resilience of institutions 
has been tested by an ever changing risk 
environment. In particular, over the last 12 months, 
the sector has become more aware of the instant 
impact operational, strategic and global events can 
have, whilst having to place greater focus on the 
longer-term risks which could impact the stability 
of most institutions.


=== Our annual risk register benchmarking exercise 
has identified a number of key risk ‘themes’ faced 
by the sector and how institutions are dealing with 
them. We look at each one below, discussing how 
institutions are worrying less about pension 
security and the political landscape (as seen in 
previous years) and more about the risks of cyber 
security and sustainability. Interestingly, with many 
universities operating in aging estates and a lack 
of funding into physical facilities in recent years, 
infrastructure was also a new challenge identified 
in 2023, with a potential to see this increase in 
relevance in the future.


=== Technology


=== Cyber security is flagged as the number one risk in our 
analysis for 2023 and has remained in the top two 
risks facing the sector in the last three years. Given 
the significant number and severity of cyber security 
incidents experienced by the sector in the last few 
years, this could have been predicted and it’s likely to 
remain high on the risk agenda for some time.


=== The sector remains an attractive target for cyber 
attackers and the likelihood of state sponsored attacks 
could increase as many institutions hold research data 
and other information that is likely to be of value.


=== Mitigating the likelihood and impact of cyber attacks is 
challenging and costly, not least because:


=== •
Many institutions have historically not invested 
significantly in technical IT controls and dedicated 
cyber security staff.


=== •
The IT environment across institutions is diverse 
and has been built up in a piecemeal fashion over 
a number of years.


=== •
Shadow IT is common and widespread across 
many institutions.


=== •
Recruiting talented staff in this area is challenging 
and costly.


=== •
Obtaining insurance to transfer (at least part of) the 
cyber security risks is increasingly difficult.


=== In addition to cyber security risks, many institutions 
face challenges in their broader IT infrastructure. 
Some are finding a move to the cloud both costly and 
technically challenging and there is an increasing 
demand and desire from students to receive education 
in innovative ways.

=== Introduction and scope (continued)


=== Our sample, scope, and methodology


=== We reviewed the risk registers of 35 Higher Education 
Institutions (HEIs). For each institution, we examined 
the risks cited, identified those similar in nature and 
grouped them by theme. We also calculated the 
average likelihood of each risk theme materialising 
and its possible impact, which allowed us to determine 
the greatest threats to an institution and the severity of 
individual risks. The detailed findings of our analysis 
are set out in the remainder of this paper, along with 
a commentary on the top themes, a comparison 
with prior years, and the types of individual 
challenges included within each theme.


=== Risk reporting is a developing topic across the HE 
sector, particularly as governance bodies (Council / 
Board / Audit Committee etc.) are keen to digest risk 
information in different formats. The risk registers we 
reviewed were in a variety of formats, but all included 
key information such as key risks, risk descriptions, 
risk scoring and mitigations in place. Some had clear 
links to strategic priorities, details of assurance 
sources and visualisations such as heat maps. 
The majority of institutions used the 5x5 risk scoring 
methodology, some use a 4x4 methodology, 
and in a small number of cases no quantitative 
scoring mechanism was used (instead a critical 
to low or RAG rating was used). To support our 
analysis, we normalised the risk assessment scores 
across all registers reviewed to a 5x5 matrix.

=== Year on year trends


=== The table below summarises the top five themes for 
the last five academic years, providing an overview of 
how they have evolved. These are the top themes 
noted in terms of both impact and likelihood.


=== A number of trends have remained consistent with the 
2021/22 year, such as cyber security and financial 
sustainability, although as noted in the detailed 
commentary below, the nature of these risks has 
evolved between the two years.


=== In the past year we have seen the risk around 
infrastructure, both digital and physical, increase 
significantly. This has been driven by challenges with:


=== •
Restructuring of campus layouts in response to 
new delivery models.


=== •
A backlog in estate maintenance due to the 
pandemic disruption over the past three years.


=== •
Concerns about future energy usage.


=== •
Sustainability, environment and climate change is 
included in the top five risks for the first time, 
perhaps unsurprisingly given the external attention 
this topic receives. This risk is driven by many 
institutions’ goals of achieving net zero by 2030, 
which for many will require significant planning and 
investment and will impact on reputation if targets 
are not achieved.


=== Finally, whilst student experience risks have dropped 
out of the top five risks this year, it remains the most 
common risk in the risk registers we reviewed 
(albeit not deemed as significant in terms of impact 
and likelihood).

=== Sustainability, environment 
and climate change (new)


=== A number of high profile issues in the sector have 
meant that cyber security is again included in the top 
five risks from our analysis this year. On the whole, the 
sector has a much better understanding of the cyber 
risks it faces, which is likely to be a contributor to the 
increase in average impact scores seen in this risk 
over the last few years. The external threat remains 
high and many across the sector are still concerned 
about the potential for an increase in state sponsored 
cyber security incidents, as well as individuals/ groups 
perpetrating ransomware attacks. At the same time, 
many institutions have placed significant investment 
into staff and technology resources to support in 
mitigating this risk (although staff resources in this 
area are scarce).


=== Education institutions continue to be viewed by 
attackers as low-effort targets, with potentially high 
rewards. The sector has seen real diversification of its 
data, software, systems and users and whilst in some 
cases, progress on centralising controls has been 
made, many institutions persist with a devolved model, 
which increases the attack surfaces available for 
unauthorised entry.


=== The use of a devolved model and the fact that the IT 
requirements across most institutions is broad and 
varied means that shadow IT, which refers to 
information technology (IT) systems deployed by 
departments other than the central IT department, is 
common. This may occur because certain research 
initiatives or academic provision require specific IT 
hardware or software. Shadow IT introduces risk by 
broadening an organisation’s attack surface and 
increasing the number of unauthorised injection points 
in the environment. It can also lead to a situation 
where the IT department does not have full visibility 
into its environment, leading to a false sense 
of security.


=== Our analysis shows that the most common security 
vulnerabilities for the HE sector are in application 
security, endpoint security, and software and patching 
updates.


=== With new cyber security trends and variations on 
existing trends more prevalent than ever, HEIs need a 
comprehensive response.


=== Further information on the broader issues around 
cyber security can be found in our Cyber Security 
Outlook 2023 report: Link


=== HEIs have an important role to play in the sustainability of 
their communities, as well as working to reduce emissions 
and minimise costs on their campuses. Whilst many 
institutions do critical research on sustainability and 
educate their students on sustainability as a matter of 
course, the reality of a net zero campus requires high 
levels of investment which many institutions are 
strategically committed to, but not financially prepared for.


=== Institutions often operate highly carbon-intensive estates, 
especially where on-site combined heat and power plants 
are in place and changing this requires leadership 
support and focus. We noted trends in:


=== •
Sustainability governance structures being revised to 
sit centrally in institutions.


=== •
The sector’s focus being on scope 1 
and 2 emissions.


=== •
A legacy viewpoint remains in that sustainability 
is an ‘estates problem’ rather than 
a university-wide responsibility.


=== The current energy crisis may also bring about positive 
change, as many universities are being driven by energy 
security requirements to focus on diversifying their energy 
sources. This clearly includes consideration of greater self 
generation, either alone or in partnership, as well as 
seeking to invest in green energy supplies.


=== One of the most complex challenges faced by universities 
is how best to quantify, monitor and report on scope 3 
emission sources. Two of the key challenges in this area 
include:


=== •
Student travel, where engagement with student travel 
surveys has been a challenge for the sector and 
therefore emissions data is often reliant on 
assumptions around student travel, which may not 
reflect reality.


=== •
Supply chain, where the level of engagement with 
suppliers on scope 3 emissions is largely dependent 
on the skills and experience of institutes’ procurement 
teams. We have noted a lack of consistency in the 
inclusion of environmental sustainability questions in 
tendering and monitoring of carbon reduction as part 
of contract management processes. This is also 
impacted by a reticence to move away from the 
traditional ‘most economically advantageous tender’ 
and towards a cost-benefit analysis including long 
term benefits to the environment and alignment with 
institutional sustainability strategy.

=== Current risks (continued)

=== Infrastructure - university estates and technology 
capacity / capability (new)


=== It’s clear from our analysis that the HE sector is facing


=== increasing financial challenges. The institutional cost 
base is increasing because of:


=== •
Rising energy costs.


=== •
Inflation on non-pay expense.


=== •
Increasing staff costs which are needed 
to support staff through the cost of living crisis.


=== •
The demand from the student population 
for increases in support services.


=== •
Increasing pension costs.


=== At the same time, undergraduate tuition fees will be 
capped at £9,250 until at least 2024/25 and there is 
little political appetite to increase these fees in the 
medium term. This means that competition for 
students, from the UK and abroad, is rising, 
particularly for 2022/23 where the total number of 
home UK undergraduate applicants dropped 
unexpectedly by c2%.


=== The Government’s levelling-up ambitions will also 
impact where research funding is directed in future. 
This is a risk for some if the opportunity to work 
collaboratively within regions is overlooked.


=== To meet the financial challenges, institutions need 
to better understand:


=== •
The drivers of their cost base and the relative 
income that is being generated on a more granular 
level for key activities (e.g. on a course by course 
basis, including resource allocation).


=== •
How new income streams will contribute to an 
improved financial position.


=== •
Where investments are being made, whether they 
will generate a sufficient return in an appropriate 
time frame.


=== •
How effective ongoing controls over procurement 
activity, ongoing contracts and budgetary 
performance are operating.


=== This may need institutions to take some bold decisions 
e.g. course closure / stopping certain activities and to 
be brave at seeking out new / innovative ways in 
which income can be generated. In the long term 
though, these types of decisions can result in 
improved financial resilience.


=== During the Covid-19 pandemic, many institutions 
refreshed their estates strategies to ensure that the 
physical infrastructure was fit for new strategic plans, new 
ways of learning and teaching and the need to ensure the 
estate is environmentally sustainable. This highlighted a 
number of risks, which have been exacerbated by a 
historic lack of planning an investment across the estate.


=== Developing an estate which takes account of the 
changing ways that campus spaces are used to reflect 
current needs of students and teaching methods is 
complex. The continued move to blended tuition as well 
as more flexible working models has obvious implications 
on the estates’ footprint given the reduced need for 
physical space for professional services staff and the 
increased need for facilitation and co-working spaces for 
students, whilst also representing a challenge for 
institutions in ensuring ongoing, visible and active support 
services for students.


=== Investment in estates now represents a significant 
opportunity to redistribute space to right-size, better use 
facilities and in some cases sell spare capacity to raise 
additional finance. Devolved control of buildings and 
research facilities means that many institutions currently 
operate a number of spaces with very low usage rates 
and some have taken the step of building data models to 
fully understand the existing use of space to inform 
strategic decision making in this area.


=== The UK’s HE sector is entering a new digital age, where 
HEIs must effectively implement digital technologies in 
order to attract talent, promote growth and to survive. It is 
key to integrate systems and implement blended learning 
programmes whilst still maintaining the quality of the 
student experience and reputation. At the same time, the 
advent of AI technologies brings a whole new set of 
academic risks, which many institutions are working 
through.


=== There has been increasing focus and investment being 
undertaken across digital infrastructure to drive 
efficiencies. This is also enabling a new way of working, 
and teaching, driven in part due to the pandemic and 
changing expectations of students.


=== HEIs that are not adapting to the digital challenge may 
struggle to compete, in a world where students embrace 
and expect digital learning. This comes with a significant 
investment cost to create an increasingly digital campus, 
especially where that investment has been neglected in 
some institutions over many years either because they 
have been perceived as too complicated or too expensive 
to deliver.

=== Staff recruitment and retention


=== Attracting and keeping the best people is a pivotal 
issue for HEIs. This risk was highlighted in 100% of 
the risk registers we analysed and attracting and 
retaining talented, high calibre academics and 
professional service staff is a growing challenge. The 
sector’s inability to attract and retain diverse, high 
calibre staff is leading to increased workloads, 
increased staff turnover and a reduced student 
experience. This then may be detrimental to the 
mental health and wellbeing of staff and has played a 
role in the current industrial action taken by thousands 
of staff in recent months. If HEIs do not effectively 
manage change and national and local employment 
issues effectively, then it may result in more prolonged 
industrial action, which will increase the risks around 
organisational and financial resilience even further.


=== Policy and engagement


=== Government and Department for Education policy 
shapes the risk environment of HEIs. It also influences 
the way in which the Office for Students shapes its 
policies and regulations and can have an impact on an 
institution’s ability to achieve its strategic goals. If 
institutions fail to adequately prepare for, and respond 
to, changes in UK government policy in relation to HE, 
it may have consequential effects in the recruitment of 
students nationally and globally, and the regional 
economy.


=== Some institutions have already started considering 
future policy changes, including the drive towards 
more vocational education (e.g. apprenticeships) and 
the potential introduction of the lifelong learning 
entitlement.


=== Student recruitment


=== Student recruitment remains a key operational and 
strategic risk for many institutions. Changing student 
priorities represent both an attrition risk and an 
opportunity to target new demographics.


=== The recruitment market can be volatile, which can be 
challenging to accurately forecast student numbers. In 
recent years, the UK sector has seen continued 
growth in international student applications. This 
increase is despite of the turbulence caused by the 
pandemic, growing global competition for students and 
the current cost of living crisis.


=== The number of Chinese students coming to the UK is 
decreasing, but still make up the largest group of 
international students according to Higher Education 
Statistics Agency (HESA) statistics. Much of the 
current growth in international student numbers is 
driven by Indian and Nigerian students, with French 
and Italian students being the two largest cohorts from 
the EU. Changes in immigration policy and wider 
foreign policy and security could have a radical impact 
long term on sector viability.


=== Student experience/student welfare


=== Student experience is of paramount importance 
throughout the whole student lifecycle. From 
recruitment, learning and teaching, pastoral support 
and beyond, there are many touchpoints that are 
pivotal to ensuring students are experiencing the best 
the institution has to offer. It also has an impact on 
academic achievement, student wellbeing, the 
National Student Survey and league tables, which 
often impact institutions’ strategic goals and KPIs. This 
is therefore an area we would always expect to feature 
highly on institutions risk registers and we have noted 
one or more risks relating to student experience on the 
risk registers we have reviewed.


=== It is well known that an increasing number of students 
are suffering with their mental health while at 
university. Support for students is key to ensuring 
students have a positive experience, and the 
all-rounded support becomes increasingly important in 
the new digital hybrid learning experience, where 
students spend less time on campus and arguably, it is 
harder for institutions to spot those in need of support.


=== Many institutions are now considering how their 
structures and processes are set up to ensure student 
experience remains a priority in a new educational 
delivery model (e.g. hybrid/blended learning).

Inadequate data security systems and processes on an individual and organisational 
basis, such that a successful cyber attack could occur and/or a serious breach of data.
•
Security related risks in internationalisation, including foreign interference, theft of IP and 
data, breaches of security, or breaching export controls.
•
If sufficient cyber and information security governance and practice is not maintained, then 
there might be detrimental impacts on the university’s ability to operate, reputation and 
financial stability.
•
Failure to implement and operate effective controls to provide assurance of cyber and 
information security resulting in the inability to avoid a major data breach or significant 
disruption to university hardware and software systems.


=== Equality and 
diversity

Failure to deliver on an institutional approved Access & Participation plan, including: a 
failure to recruit, retain and maintain diverse student profiles; and failure to remove a 
student attainment gap
•
Risk of a failure to deliver an inclusive educational experience.
•
Risk that not tackling inequalities will impact culture, damage morale and impact reputation 
(both staff and students).
•
Increasing staff diversity and inclusion.


=== Financial 
sustainability


=== •
Failure to manage and diversify income or manage the cost base and levels of investment, 
such that levels of shorter term cash flow, cash holdings, and surplus are not achieved 
(and insufficient headroom is maintained) leading to a longer-term impact on the 
university’s ability to invest and deliver the strategy.
•
Capital investment programmes fail to focus resources on strategically important priorities.
•
Failure to meet bank covenant thresholds, resulting in loan foreclosure.
•
Changes to the funding rules for QR funding/dual support mechanism in the future reduces 
research income.
•
Does not respond effectively to changes in the external environment leading to a financial 
impact which cannot be mitigated without changes to university strategy (e.g. poor UK 
economic performance, policy changes, freezing of UK undergraduate tuition fees).
•
Challenge to financial sustainability due to increased employer contributions to pensions, 
constraints to universities ongoing capacity to raise debt finance.


=== Student 
experience


=== •
Student satisfaction and outcomes do not improve in line with planned expectations and 
investment and fail to outperform competitors.
•
Failure to deliver a consistently high quality inclusive education, caused by a failure to 
adapt and resource teaching and learning methods to meet the needs of large student 
cohorts due to accelerated growth.
•
Failure to provide subject specific, professional development and employability skills to 
help all students’ secure graduate employment and meet career aspirations.
•
Failure to develop a vibrant, student voice and community that supports institutional 
learning and individual student satisfaction and engagement.

=== Risk themes and subcategories
PwC | Managing risk in higher education
12

=== Risk theme
Subcategories of risk


=== Infrastructure - 
university estates 
and capacity


=== •
We fail to plan, invest and maintain the university’s physical estate to ensure that its size, 
shape and structure are aligned to the university’s strategic ambitions, is environmentally 
sustainable and compliant with relevant health and safety legislation.
•
Lack of internal capacity to deliver capital investment programmes.
•
Student accommodation: demand for accommodation (both university provision and 
private providers) outstrips supply, impacting on the university’s strategy for growth.
•
If adequate research and teaching infrastructure, including the physical and digital estate, 
are not developed and sustained, then our ability to deliver a high-quality student 
experience and excellence in teaching and research may be adversely affected.


=== IT infrastructure
•
IT - Failure to meet changing and increasing demand for IT caused by increased costs, 
delays and supply chain challenges leading to an impact on business capabilities, 
operational efficiencies and future growth.
•
Fit for purpose and resilient business processes are not in place and working risk that 
digital and physical infrastructure is not fit for purpose.
•
Failure to adapt the physical and digital infrastructure will impact on the achievement of the 
future strategic direction and changing individual and societal expectations. 
•
Failure to improve our digital capabilities to conduct high-quality, collaborative and globally 
impactful challenge-based research and innovation.


=== Organisational 
change


=== •
Operating model - Failure to ensure that our operating model adapts as needed to best 
support our academic teaching and research objectives.
•
Risk that ineffective change management, particularly around new ways of working will 
limit abilities to make changes around our business model and to successfully deliver 
strategic goals and objectives.
•
Strategic change programmes: Risk of failure to lead and manage the substantial amount 
of technical, educational and people related change.
•
Risk that the pace and volume of change related to our long term plan is not appropriate to 
meet overall aims and objectives leading to poorly managed actions and low quality 
implementation.


=== Partnerships
•
Failure to manage impacts due to a potential change in partners for international campus.
•
Over reliance on a single geographical region and/or country means vulnerability to 
political or macroeconomic factors.
•
If the university fails to develop a critical mass of partnerships that spans its academic and 
operational activities and that are closely aligned to our strategic objectives, then the 
university will become uncompetitive in innovation and enterprise, and will fail to secure 
income, research collaborations and educational opportunities.


=== Student 
recruitment


=== •
If the university fails to sustain the recent growth in student numbers from international 
markets, a serious budget deficit would result.
•
Failure to have an appropriate portfolio, attracting prospective students, meeting student 
expectation, or preparing them for their chosen profession.
•
We fail to achieve planned retention levels from the previous academic year, resulting in a 
reduced forecast tuition fee income and/or over-reliance on budget contingencies.
•
Failure to optimise the university international partnerships, presence, and enrolments in 
light of changes in UK and International Government Policies and trade blocks and 
changes in competitive intensity, student expectations and recruitment channels.
•
A destabilised sector, and aggressive competition leads to failure to meet planned 
recruitment targets and associated income impacts long term financial sustainability 
limiting opportunities for investment in strategic priorities.
