• Security related risks in internationalisation, including foreign interference, theft of IP and

there might be detrimental impacts on the university’s ability to operate, reputation and

Risk themes and subcategories (continued)
Risk theme Subcategories of risk
Infrastructure - •
We fail to plan, invest and maintain the university’s physical estate to ensure that its size,
university estates shape and structure are aligned to the university’s strategic ambitions, is environmentally
and capacity sustainable and compliant with relevant health and safety legislation.
• Lack of internal capacity to deliver capital investment programmes.
• Student accommodation: demand for accommodation (both university provision and
private providers) outstrips supply, impacting on the university’s strategy for growth.
•
If adequate research and teaching infrastructure, including the physical and digital estate,
are not developed and sustained, then our ability to deliver a high-quality student
experience and excellence in teaching and research may be adversely affected.
IT infrastructure •
IT - Failure to meet changing and increasing demand for IT caused by increased costs,
delays and supply chain challenges leading to an impact on business capabilities,
operational efficiencies and future growth.
• Fit for purpose and resilient business processes are not in place and working risk that
digital and physical infrastructure is not fit for purpose.
•
Failure to adapt the physical and digital infrastructure will impact on the achievement of the
future strategic direction and changing individual and societal expectations.
•
Failure to improve our digital capabilities to conduct high-quality, collaborative and globally
impactful challenge-based research and innovation.
Organisational • Operating model - Failure to ensure that our operating model adapts as needed to best
change support our academic teaching and research objectives.
• Risk that ineffective change management, particularly around new ways of working will
limit abilities to make changes around our business model and to successfully deliver
strategic goals and objectives.
• Strategic change programmes: Risk of failure to lead and manage the substantial amount
of technical, educational and people related change.
• Risk that the pace and volume of change related to our long term plan is not appropriate to
meet overall aims and objectives leading to poorly managed actions and low quality
implementation.
Partnerships • Failure to manage impacts due to a potential change in partners for international campus.
• Over reliance on a single geographical region and/or country means vulnerability to
political or macroeconomic factors.
•
If the university fails to develop a critical mass of partnerships that spans its academic and
operational activities and that are closely aligned to our strategic objectives, then the
university will become uncompetitive in innovation and enterprise, and will fail to secure
income, research collaborations and educational opportunities.
Student •
If the university fails to sustain the recent growth in student numbers from international
recruitment markets, a serious budget deficit would result.
•
Failure to have an appropriate portfolio, attracting prospective students, meeting student
expectation, or preparing them for their chosen profession.
•
We fail to achieve planned retention levels from the previous academic year, resulting in a
reduced forecast tuition fee income and/or over-reliance on budget contingencies.
•
Failure to optimise the university international partnerships, presence, and enrolments in
light of changes in UK and International Government Policies and trade blocks and
changes in competitive intensity, student expectations and recruitment channels.

The current national dispute, which includes pay, precarious contracts, workloads and
