Trump reiterated his support for tariffs, saying: ‘It’s simple, it’s easy, it’s precise.’ Trump noted that Carney has ‘a more complex idea,’ and said, ‘we’re going to look at both.’\nThe Latest\nThe annual summit of the leaders of Canada, the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Japan is officially underway in Kananaskis, Alta.\nAfter a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Mark Carney this morning, U.S. President Donald Trump signalled he wants to hammer out the details of a new trade deal during the summit.\nThe high-stakes negotiations come as Trump continues to impose punishing global tariffs, including on Canadian steel, aluminum and autos.\nTop envoys say Carney and Trump  have agreed to accelerate talks about reaching a trade and security deal.\nThe summit is drawing protests, primarily in Calgary and nearby Banff, where organizers have established designated demonstration zones.\nFeatured Media\nLeftRight\nSkip Featured Media\nIs the G7 still relevant?, play video\nclosed captions\n6:15\nIs the G7 still relevant?\nHundreds protest in Calgary as G7 summit kicks off, play video\nclosed captions\n2:14\nHundreds protest in Calgary as G7 summit kicks off\nWhat are Canada’s objectives for the G7 summit?, play video\nclosed captions\n21:06\nWhat are Canada’s objectives for the G7 summit?\nWhy is Trump, a convicted felon, allowed to visit Canada?, play video\n0:45\nWhy is Trump, a convicted felon, allowed to visit Canada?\nTrump arrives in Alberta for G7 summit, play video\nclosed captions\n3:27\nTrump arrives in Alberta for G7 summit\n‘We should have no tariffs' on Canadian exports to U.S., ambassador says, play video\nclosed captions\n0:25\n‘We should have no tariffs' on Canadian exports to U.S., ambassador says\nCanada seeing ‘encouraging’ progress in tariff talks: Minister, play video\nclosed captions\n2:02\nCanada seeing ‘encouraging’ progress in tariff talks: Minister\nUpdates\nJune 16\n9 minutes ago\n30-day deadline or 30-day deferral?Michael Woods\nU.S. President Donald Trump arrives for the G7 Leaders' Summit at the Rocky Mountain resort town of Kananaskis, Alberta, Canada, Monday. (Chris Helgren/Reuters)\nNow that Prime Minister Mark Carney has publicly stated a firm timeline for reaching a new economic and security agreement with the U.S., where do things go from here?\nEver since U.S. President Donald Trump doubled steel and aluminium tariffs earlier this month, Carney has faced questions about when — or whether — Canada would retaliate in kind. Carney has demurred, preferring to continue private negotiations. That’s a different approach from March and April, when Canada struck back against Trump’s tariffs.\nIt’s possible this 30-day timeframe could give Carney an impetus to retaliate if the two can’t reach an agreement by then.\nThere’s also the CUSMA to think about. It’s up for renegotiation next year, and that looms larger the longer there is no Canada-U.S. deal in the nearer term.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is among the non-G7 leaders who will be in Kananaskis tomorrow for the second day of the summit.\nShareCopy link\n1 hour ago\nCarney, Trump aiming for deal within 30 daysMichael Woods\nThe Canadian readout of this morning’s Carney-Trump meeting is out, and it has some new information: The two leaders will work toward a new deal within 30 days.\nThis is the first time either side has put a timeframe on the talks.\nThe readout added that the leaders also spoke about collaborating on priorities like critical minerals, gun and drug smuggling, illegal drugs and border security, as well as possible areas of co-operation on defence.\nWe haven’t yet seen a White House readout from the meeting.\nShareCopy link\n1 hour ago\nGetting the shotMichael Woods\nBroadcast crews outside the G7 media centre in Banff on Monday, June 16, 2025. (Michael Woods/CBC News)\nAlthough the G7 summit itself is taking place in Kananaskis, the media centre for the summit is in Banff, an 80-kilometre drive away.\nJournalists heading to the site must take shuttle buses and go through security sweeps to get there.\nMany are staying in Banff. And the picturesque backgrounds you might see in broadcast coverage of the summit are no accident.\nPictured above are just some of the live camera positions for both Canadian and international media.\nThe media centre also has a café that’s open 24 hours a day, because international media here are filing their stories at all hours of the day and night.\nShareCopy link\n1 hour ago\nCanada's goal is still 'to get the tariffs off'Verity Stevenson\n‘We should have no tariffs' on Canadian exports to U.S., ambassador says\n3 hours ago\nDuration 0:25\nFollowing initial meetings at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alta., on Monday morning, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, says although discussions are ongoing, the government’s position remains aimed at the removal of tariffs on Canadian exports to the Unites States.\nSpeaking on CBC's Power & Politics, Canada’s ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman gave some insight into Trump's motivations for imposing tariffs on Canada and other countries — and said both nations have more negotiation meetings planned this week.\nThe two sides have agreed to accelerate their talks toward an agreement on trade. The goal on the Canadian side has been \"to get the tariffs off,\" Hillman told host David Cochrane.\nTrump sees tariffs as an economic tool to achieve several things, Hillman said, including \"for creating barriers into the U.S., to encourage domestic production … [to] leverage policy changes in other countries,\" as well as to raise money so the U.S. can cut taxes.\nWhen it comes to Canada, though, Hillman said envoys are \"working very, very hard to make the case that using those tariffs with us is not going to be as productive.\"\nShareCopy link\n2 hours ago\nBanff protest draws small but growing groupHelen Pike\nA small group of protesters gathered Monday in Banff at the Fenlands Banff Recreation Centre.

It’s been temporarily removed for the summit.\nWhile the parking lot was mostly empty earlier today, as of 3 p.m., RCMP said it had drawn around 80 demonstrators. Demonstrators were on site for a variety of reasons, including to show support for Palestinian and Ukrainian people and for migrant workers.\nShareCopy link\n3 hours ago\nProtests against Indian PM Modi in CalgaryJoel Dryden\nProtesters at Calgary’s Municipal Plaza on Monday demonstrated against the presence of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G7 summit. (Mike Symington/CBC)\nProtests are continuing in the Calgary region today, including demonstrations in support of Khalistan, a proposed independent Sikh homeland in northern India.\nA police officer on the scene estimated around 70 demonstrators took to Calgary's Municipal Complex Plaza. The vast majority were protesting against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whom Prime Minister Mark Carney invited to the G7. There were more than 20 police officers at the plaza.\nOfficials have set up “designated demonstration zones” in Calgary and Banff for protesters amid this year’s summit, one of which is located at the plaza in front of city hall.\nAnd while hundreds came out on Sunday to voice their opinions at city hall, so far, the other zones haven’t seen much activity.\nIn Banff, a group of around 40 protestors is tucked away in a parking lot, out of view from tourists streaming into the popular tourism destination.\nModi is scheduled to land in Calgary this evening.\nShareCopy link\n3 hours ago\nTrump happy to be in Alberta, says LeBlancCatharine Tunney\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, left, welcomes U.S. President Donald Trump to the G7 Summit in Kananaskis, Alta., on Monday, June 16, 2025.

And obviously the Americans share that view,” Canada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc told the group gathered at the resort in Kananaskis. He was flanked by Kirsten Hillman, Canada’s ambassador to the U.S.\nThey said they met with U.S. trade representative Jamieson Greer and officials after the bilateral meeting and have plans to meet again later this week.\nNeither got even close to answering questions about what the holdups are.\nShareCopy link\n4 hours ago\nCharlotte Cardin to perform for G7 leadersMichael Woods\nPop singer Charlotte Cardin will receive the SOCAN Award for songwriter of the year — performer.

Is there something that makes that seat safter than others? Not according to aviation and disaster medicine experts.\nAfter Air India crash, Thai singer who survived deadly 1998 crash says he also sat in 11A\nNatalie Stechyson  · CBC News  · Posted: Jun 16, 2025 4:53 PM EDT | Last Updated: 1 hour ago\nA composite image of two plane crashes.

(Adnan Abidi/Reuters, and Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images)\nSocial Sharing\nTwo different doomed flights, two different survivors with one thing in common: seat 11A.\nVishwashkumar Ramesh, the sole survivor of the Air India crash that killed 241 people on board and several more on the ground after the plane crashed minutes after takeoff last Thursday, has made headlines around the world.\nThe Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner struck a medical college hostel in a ball of flames when it crashed into a residential area of the northwestern Indian city of Ahmedabad. Most bodies of those aboard the plane were burned beyond recognition. But police say Ramesh was seated near the emergency exit of the plane and managed to jump through it after the crash.\nU.K. media have dubbed it the \"miracle of seat 11A,\" after Ramesh's boarding pass confirmed that's where he was sitting on the flight bound for London's Gatwick Airport.\nSole survivor of Air India crash has an incredible story — but he's not unique\nVishwashkumar Ramesh, the sole survivor of the Air India crash that killed 241 people on board and several more on the ground, is seen in this handout photo issued by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs. (Ministry of Home Affairs India/The Associated Press)\nBut Thai singer and actor James Ruangsak Loychusak, who was one of the survivors of a deadly 1998 Thai Airways plane crash, is calling it an \"uncanny coincidence.\"\n\"Survivor of a plane crash in India. He sat in the same seat as me. 11A,\" Loychusak wrote on Facebook Friday.\nAccording to the Aviation Safety Network, the Airbus A310 Loychusak was aboard in 1998 crashed during its approach to Surat Thani Airport, killing 101 people.\nThe plane crashed in heavy rain, after its third landing attempt at the airport 500 kilometres southwest of Bangkok. But 45 people survived, including Loychusak.\nIn a further explanation, Loychusak wrote in Thai that he doesn't have his ticket or boarding pass from the flight. As such, CBC News is unable to verify his exact seat. But he claimed to know his seat number based on online seating charts for his aircraft, which he shared online.\n\"That was an uncanny coincidence,\" he told India's The Telegraph Online Monday. \"The kind that gives you goosebumps.\"\nJust a coincidence?\nAfter Loychusak shared his post, the story began to go viral, and some people commenting online have wondered if there's something about seat 11A that makes it safer than others.\nNot according to aviation and disaster medicine experts, who tend to agree that all crashes are unique, and there are a number of random factors that could improve your chances of survival, so it's more about all those variables aligning.\n\"Each accident is different, and it is impossible to predict survivability based on seat location,\" Mitchell Fox, a director at Flight Safety Foundation, a U.S.-based nonprofit, previously told Reuters.\nPlus, seat 11A is located in different spots on different planes, depending on the configuration of the aircraft.\nIn Ramesh's case, seat 11A on the 787-8 Dreamliner was the first row in economy class, directly behind the emergency exit.\nBut in an Airbus A310, according to photos on the Seat Guru website and a graphic of a seating chart shared on Facebook by Loychusak, 11A is a few rows ahead of the emergency exit.\nIn general, sitting near an emergency exit can improve chances of evacuation, especially in survivable crashes involving fire or smoke, said Stephen Wood, an associate clinical professor at Northeastern University in Boston and an expert in disaster medicine and EMS.\n'I stood up and ran': Miraculous survival of Air India passenger with 241 confirmed deaths\nWhat we know about the Boeing 787 Dreamliner in the deadly Air India crash\nHowever, in a high-energy impact crash, like the one in India, survivability based on seat location becomes far more complex, he told CBC News. Exit row seats are often near reinforced parts of the airframe, Wood explained. They are also adjacent to structural components like the wing span which can be sites of significant destruction.\n\"In this case, the fact that the survivor was seated there may have been fortuitous, but it's not a guarantee of safety in most crashes,\" Wood said, speaking specifically about Ramesh's experience.\n\"So yes, his seat may have helped, but survival likely depended on much more than that alone.\"\nWATCH | Survivor of Air India crash walks away:\nBritish national was sole survivor of Air India crash\n3 days ago\nDuration 4:43Vishwashkumar Ramesh, a British national of Indian descent, was the only passenger who survived the crash of an Air India plane bound for London that killed at least 240 people on Thursday in Ahmedabad. Social media video appeared to show him walking away from the crash; CBC News has not independently verified the video.\nEvery crash is different\nIn short, it doesn't really matter where you sit since every accident is different, experts say.\n\"It all depends on the crash dynamics,\" Daniel Kwasi Adjekum, an aviation safety researcher at the University of North Dakota, told Live Science earlier this month.\nA 2007 Popular Mechanics study of crashes since 1971 found that passengers toward the back of the plane had better survival odds.\nSome experts suggest the wing section offers more stability (while also acknowledging the danger of being over the fuel tanks).

(Ajit Solanki/The Associated Press)\nSitting next to an exit door, as Ramesh did, gives people an opportunity to be one of the first passengers to get out in the event that a plane goes down, although some exits don't function after a crash.\nFor instance, Ramesh has said the opposite side of the plane was crushed against a wall of the building it crashed into. This could have prevented anyone who may have survived the impact on the right side of the plane from escaping through that emergency exit.\n\"From a technical perspective, survival in these kinds of events is usually due to a confluence of rare but explainable factors including the aircraft's breakup pattern, impact dynamics, the survivor's position and condition and sometimes just seconds of timing,\" Wood told CBC News.\n'Beyond seat numbers'\nOn Facebook Sunday, Loychusak noted that his story is \"now going viral across many countries.\"\n\"But what I truly want to share goes beyond seat numbers,\" he said.\n\"I want to tell the world what this experience gave me — not just survival, but a completely new perspective on life.\"\nThe Thai Airways flight that crashed on Dec. 11, 1998, was carrying 132 passengers and 14 crew. Hundreds of rescue workers waded through a muddy swamp to pull charred bodies from the wreckage.\nRescue workers search for victims of the Thai Airways flight TG-261 crash in a muddy plantation in southern Thailand early on Dec. 12, 1998.

(Adrian Wyld/The Canadian Press)\nSocial Sharing\nConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre will face a mandatory leadership review in January, after the party failed to form government in the last federal election.\nThe Conservative Party's national council agreed on Saturday that the leadership review would take place in Calgary, according to CBC News sources.\nThe Globe and Mail first reported the story.\nIf a leader does not resign following an election loss, the party's constitution requires Conservative Party members to vote on whether that leader should stay on at its next national convention.\nPoilievre faces uncertain future after losing his own seat and failing to depose the Liberals\nWhile the Conservative Party saw a boost in vote share under Poilievre with a breakthrough among new voting blocs, they failed to form government and he lost the Ottawa-area seat of Carleton — one he had held since 2004 — by more than 4,000 votes.\nIn May, Battle River-Crowfoot MP Damien Kurek said he would step aside to allow Poilievre to run in the Alberta riding, which is considered one of the safest Conservative seats in the country.\nPoilievre was set to lead the Conservatives to a historic majority government after the party enjoyed double-digit leads for more than 18 months in national polls over the Liberals and as former prime minister Justin Trudeau's popularity waned.\nBut the trade war launched by U.S. President Donald Trump and Trudeau's resignation precipitated a reversal of fortunes for the Conservative Party, which won 144 seats in the recent federal election.\nWith files from Kate McKenna, J.P.

(Submitted by Ryan Primrose )\nSocial Sharing\nSeven years ago, a tree fell over in the northern Ontario bush and exposed an archeological mystery that researchers are still trying to understand.\nFound carved into the bedrock, not far from the town of Wawa, were 255 symbols arranged in a square about 1.2 metres by 1.5 metres, and next to it, there is carved a picture of a boat with 16 people on it, as well as 14 Xs.\nPhotos of the discovery made their way to Ryan Primrose, an archeologist based in New Liskeard and the director of the Ontario Centre for Archeological Education.\n\"Well it's certainly among the least expected finds that I think I've encountered during my career. It's absolutely fascinating,\" he said.\nPrimrose has been working on the carvings since 2018 and is now talking about it publicly for the first time.\nThe 250 runic characters carved into the rock spell out the Lord's Prayer. It's believed it was carved in the early 1800s and then buried, only to be exposed when a tree fell in 2018. (Submitted by Ryan Primrose)\n\"We didn't want to release information publicly until we had done as much as we could at the time to understand exactly what it was,\" he said.\nPrimrose quickly realized the 255 characters were Nordic runes, part of an alphabet known as Futhark that was used in Scandinavia in centuries past. He was worried some would jump to conclusions that these were carved by Vikings more than a millennium ago.\nThat's why he sought the help of Henrik Williams, an emeritus professor at Uppsala University in Sweden and a leading expert in runology.\nNext to the prayer carving is a picture of a boat with 16 people on it, as well as 14 Xs.  (Submitted by Ryan Primrose )\nHe came to analyze the well-worn carvings on a drizzly cold October day several years ago.\n\"I was under a tarpaulin for three hours with a flash light, looking at the runes and the others were sitting outside freezing,\" Williams said.\n\"And I came out with this reading.\"\nHe realized that the runic writing spelled out the words of The Lord's Prayer in Swedish and traced it back to a 1611 runic version of the prayer, which was republished in the 19th century.\n\"It must have taken days and days of work. They are really deeply carved into the rock. Someone must have spent a couple of weeks carving this thing,\" Williams said.\nA new way of exploring the ancient past: N. Ont archeologist wants Indigenous communities to play larger role\n'They're putting the First Nations history at risk,' says northern Ontario archeologist about Bill 5\n\"And this must have been a Swede. Were there any Swedes at all here?\"\nPrimrose said subsequent research has shown that the Hudson's Bay Company did hire Swedes in the 1800s to work at trading posts in the Canadian wilderness, including the Michipicoten post, not too far from where the carving was found.\nHe says his going theory, based on how worn the carving is, is that it was likely made in the early to mid-1800s.\nWilliams admits to being \"a little disappointed\" that it's only about 200 years old, but says \"the mystery around it doesn't decrease just because it's slightly younger than we hoped it was.\"\n\"Anybody has to start wondering 'Why on Earth did they carve it here and why did they choose that text?' And there's no answers,\" he said.\n\"But mysteries, they do tend to attract people and this one will certainly do that.\"\nSwedish rune expert Henrik Williams spent hours under a tarp on a cold northern Ontario day interpreting the markings, before determining it was the Lord's Prayer.  (Submitted by Ryan Primrose )\nPrimrose speculates this carving could have been a spot for religious worship, perhaps a gathering place for Swedes who worked at the trading post, or the solitary work of one person.\nHe says the carving was found under several inches of soil and it was likely deliberately buried, but no other artifacts were found in the area which makes it \"difficult to tell what's going on.\"\nWorking with the property owner, Primrose has applied for a lease hold on the land and is hoping to get funding to develop the site into a historical tourist attraction, including a structure over the carving to protect it from further wear.\nHe hopes to have those plans formalized by the end of the summer and then give the public a chance to ponder the mysterious carving in person.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nErik White\njournalist\nErik White is a CBC journalist based in Sudbury.

The Yale professor explains how her knowledge of Eastern Europe informed her choice to move to Canada.\nHistorian Marci Shore argues the U.S. can no longer be counted on to defend the principles of democracy\nCBC Radio  · Posted: May 23, 2025 11:36 AM EDT | Last Updated: June 3\nMarci Shore and her husband, fellow Yale professor and historian Timothy Snyder, recently accepted teaching posts at the University of Toronto. They will begin their new positions at the Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy in Toronto this fall. Shore says her knowledge of Eastern Europe informed her choice to move to Canada.  (Rostislav Kostenko)\nSocial Sharing\nIdeas53:58Why this Yale professor warns it's time to end the affair with the U.S.\n*Originally published on May 23, 2025.\nIt has to be done. It's time to break up with America: \"You have to see the catastrophe for what it is,\" said intellectual historian Marci Shore.\nShe wouldn't normally give the world relationship advice but she feels an urgent need to send a clear message.\n\"This is the end of the affair.\"\nShore, a professor of history at Yale University who will be teaching at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy this fall, has been studying the history of totalitarianism for nearly 30 years. She blames the U.S. for the failed romance.\nTo put it simply, it's not us — it's them, she said.\n\"You cannot trust this government. You cannot trust the United States. Don't think you can finesse the situation you are dealing with, you're looking into an abyss,\" she said in a lecture delivered at the Toronto Metropolitan University in April, as part of its International Issues Discussion series.\nShore says it's \"wrenching\" that she can no longer rely on her country to defend democracy. As a scholar who has studied the arc of fascism in Eastern Europe, she saw the red flags waving well ahead of many others.\n\"If I panicked sooner than most other Americans, it's not because I was any smarter, but because I had been watching what was going on in Russia and Ukraine,\" she said.\nShore and her husband, Timothy Snyder, are two of three prominent Yale scholars who recently accepted teaching posts at the University of Toronto. While the offer was on the table before the U.S. election, Shore says the re-election of Donald Trump tipped the scales.\nIDEAS host Nahlah Ayed spoke to Marci Shore about her talk.\nHere is an excerpt from their conversation.\nYou often make references to words from the Russian language to help us understand what is going on in this moment. In your speech, you referred to the Slavic word for 'laying bare.' What's the word?\nObnazhaya. It's the idea that there's no attempt to cover up wrongdoing anymore. A recent example, I guess, might be President Trump accepting a luxury jet from Qatar. So you'd expect this kind of blatant disregard for accepted norms would cause outrage. Why doesn't it? That's one of the curious phenomenon.\nObnazhaya is a word ... used to describe the esthetic methods of the avant-garde, that you lay bare the device. You show people what you're doing. And it then became a kind of theme of the political technologists, the postmodern spin doctors, who bring Putin to power.\nIntellectual historian Marci Shore says understanding Putinism is a geopolitical guessing game. There’s no way of knowing what may come next. (Alexei Nikolsky/Sputnik/The Associated Press)\nWhat is remarkable about our system is that nothing is hidden. All of the ugliness is right there, not disguised by any architectural excesses. And that's the whole strategy. There's something disempowering about it.\nAnother example of 'laying bare' could be the extraordinary moment that we saw in the Oval Office, where Ukrainian President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy is basically being admonished publicly by JD Vance and Donald Trump. What new insight, if any, did you glean about the moment that we're in?\nThat was one of the most revolting things I've ever seen on television. I think it affected me very viscerally on a couple different levels. I would point to at least three things.\nOne is as a historian of Stalinism, that motif of you must say \"thank you,\" you have to say \"thank you.\" This is, first of all, what the abusive husband says to his wife. This is also what the people being interrogated by the Stalinist secret police hear from their interrogators. This is what the victims of the show trials are made to [do]. You thank the party for giving you your just punishment.\nIn fact, [former Polish president] Lech Wałęsa and a whole collection of former Polish political prisoners, including several people I know well and who sat in prison in communist Poland, wrote a letter saying, this is how our secret police interrogator spoke to us...\nThen the second thing was — you're not holding any cards — which was just a 'laying bare' of the fact that everything is transactional, everything is a game. Zelenskyy's response was perfect — we're not playing cards — because for him it was not a game, for him he's responsible for the lives of these millions of people.\n[IMAGE\nBut then I think what really punched me in the stomach was Trump saying to Zelenskyy, he [Zelenskyy] has such hatred for Putin. It's really hard to make a deal with someone who's got this hatred. And when you are watching day after day your cities burned and your children buried alive under rubble, and [this] young journalist captured and ... tortured with electric shocks, you might not feel very warmly to that person. You might not even have instrumentalist \"let's make a deal\" kind of feelings toward that person.\nAnd the moral nihilism of not being even able to make that empathetic leap, I just thought we are looking into an abyss.\nYou talk bluntly about Europe, as well as Canada, needing to recognize that this is the end of the affair as you describe it with America, and its commitment to defending democracy. And we're seeing signs of it on a daily basis, the questioning of NATO and the need to protect Europe against the possible Russian threat. Do you see any signs that this message is actually sinking in either here in Canada or in Europe?\nI'm not yet qualified to comment on Canadian politics. But the wake-up call to Europe, it's clearly going in that direction, but too slowly. And the fact that those four presidents went to Kyiv was a very good sign. I think that the grotesque scene in the Oval Office helped that. But it's very, very hard I think for Europeans than Canadians, to let go of that myth of America as the land of the free and the home of the brave.\nIDEAS AFTERNOONHow 'freedom' has been distorted: American historian Timothy Snyder\nAnalysisA new ballot question: How should Canada define its relationship with the U.S.?\nGabrielis Landbergis, the former foreign minister of Lithuania, just gave this New York Times interview a couple of days ago, and he said, you have to understand it's like ripping through our bodies. It's like you're tearing your heart out. You grow up with this idea of the arsenal of democracy and what it means to have that taken away.\nAnd it doesn't mean that all Americans have changed their mind. I constantly get messages from Americans saying, \"please tell all the Canadians you see that we still love them. Please tell them that this is not representative of us.\" Certainly, that's not what everybody feels. But the people in power should absolutely not be trusted.\nThe idea that you can get inside Trump's psyche and figure out how to have a good relationship with him, I think that's a mistake because there's no operative: true, false, good, evil — it's only what is advantageous or disadvantageous to him at any given moment in time.\nMarci Shore says U.S. President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance humiliated Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a meeting at the Oval Office, Feb. 28, 2025, by asking him to express his gratitude to them. She says it’s a similar tactic used during Stalinism.  (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\nYou've only been in Canada for a few months, but I'm curious what you've been able to glean looking at your home country of the United States from this side: any new insights observing from over here?\nWell, I feel calmer here. I'm in a very privileged position, because now I've given myself a little bit of distance. Canada always felt to me like a place that was less edgy, which was part of the appeal, even independently of American politics.\nIt's a place where there are gun control laws. It's a place where there's more of a social support system. It's a place where I feel in my kids' schools that there's less of a competitive edge among the kids, among the parents. And so I feel like it gives me a little space to take a deep breath, but I also feel guilty about being in this relatively safe place and taking advantage of it.\nA U.S. brain drain could be Canada's brain gain\nFRONT BURNERYale fascism expert on fleeing to Canada\nBut does it in any way inform your thinking about what is happening in your country? Do you have more clarity or a different posture being here and watching what's happening in the States?\nI would say the one thing I thought about was the way in which all the Canadian commentators were saying that it was Trump's election that saved the Liberal Party in Canada because it warned people about what could happen. That sense of, could people be attentive to what was happening across the border in such a way that would shake them into responsibility for themselves, I found that quite inspiring.\nIf this is, as you say, the end of the end-of-history, what do you hope comes next?\nMy fantasy when I'm not being a neurotic catastrophist is that there will be a domino effect of the fall of tyranny, that Putin's regime will fall, that Lukashenko's regime will fall, the Iranian regime will fall, that Trump's regime would fall. That there'll be a complete Ukrainian victory and that Ukraine will be the vanguard no longer of catching up with the West — the [Francis] Fukuyama end-of-history model that we're all moving inevitably and exorbitantly to liberal democracy, and you should follow the people who are further along down the road.

(Christinne Muschi/Canadian Press/File)\nSocial Sharing\nNaming six players to the preliminary roster of the Canadian men's Olympic hockey team was the easy part for federation brass.\nThe tougher calls will come at the end of the year when the final roster is determined for the 2026 Milan-Cortina Games.\nWith a few locks out of the way, let the debate begin on who joins them.\nThe first few months of the 2025-26 NHL regular season will factor significantly into the decision-making process for general manager Doug Armstrong and the Hockey Canada management group. But players on the so-called \"First Six\" list don't have to worry about whether their name will be called.\nThey include two-time Olympic champion Sidney Crosby — who scored the golden goal in 2010 at Vancouver and helped Canada repeat four years later in Sochi — along with fellow forwards Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon, Brayden Point and Sam Reinhart. Cale Makar was the lone defenceman on the early list.\n\"Now it gets interesting as we fill out that roster,\" Armstrong said Monday on a conference call.\nThe 12-country tournament begins Feb. 11. It's the first time NHL players will participate in the Olympics since the 2014 Games in Russia.\nWATCH | Canada GM announces initial 6 players for Olympic men's hockey squad:\nTeam Canada GM Doug Armstrong announces 1st 6 players on men's Olympic hockey team\n4 hours ago\nDuration 9:55Sidney Crosby, Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon, Cale Makar, Brayden Point and Sam Reinhart will all represent Canada at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics.\nEarly roster announcements were also used ahead of the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament last winter. McDavid scored the overtime winner to give Canada a 3-2 victory over the United States in the championship game in Boston.\nThe event marked the first best-on-best competition since the World Cup of Hockey in 2016.\n'Incredibly honoured to represent my country'\nMcDavid, a three-time league MVP, is coming off a 100-point regular season. He has also guided the Edmonton Oilers back to the Stanley Cup final, where they need a win over Reinhart's Florida Panthers on Tuesday to force a series decider.\n\"Incredibly honoured to represent my country at the biggest sporting event in the world,\" McDavid said at a media availability in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \"You think of the Canadian players that can be named to that team, and to be selected again, it means a lot.\"\nNHLers to return to Olympics in 2026, 2030 after missing last 2 Winter Games\nWhat we learned about Team Canada at the 4 Nations Face-Off ahead of Milano-Cortina Olympics\nThe 37-year-old Crosby, who recently completed his 20th season with the Pittsburgh Penguins, was the lone Canadian on the early list with Olympic experience.\nAll six players suited up at the 4 Nations tournament. Reinhart said it was \"incredible\" to wear Canada colours at that event in February.\n\"When you're growing up, when you're watching as a kid, it's Stanley Cup finals and it's Team Canada,\" he said. \"Those are the two things that you dream about playing for. To have that opportunity is pretty exciting.\"\nPlayer selections were made by Armstrong, assistants Julien BriseBois, Jim Nill and Don Sweeney, director of player personnel Kyle Dubas and head coach Jon Cooper.\nPlayer relations adviser Ryan Getzlaf and Scott Salmond, senior vice-president of high performance and hockey operations, also provided input, Hockey Canada said.\n\"I am honoured to be named one of the first six players for Canada's men's hockey team at the 2026 Olympics alongside Nathan, Cale, Connor, Brayden and Sam, as all five are incredible players and leaders,\" Crosby said in a statement.\n\"I am grateful for the opportunity to represent Canada at the Olympics, as I know how much pride comes with wearing the Maple Leaf on the international stage.\"\nRest of roster to be unveiled early in 2026\nMakar, who had 92 points this past season for Colorado, won the Norris Trophy as the NHL's top defenceman. MacKinnon had a 116-point campaign for the Avalanche while Point is a two-time Stanley Cup winner with the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThe rest of the roster will be finalized early in the new year.

(Mark Schiefelbein/The Associated Press)\nSocial Sharing\nPrime Minister Mark Carney and U.S. President Donald Trump are putting a deadline on ironing out bilateral trade irritants and getting some sort of deal on tariffs: 30 days.\nThe Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said the two leaders met on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alta., and agreed the trade talks need to be sped up with a goal of reaching a deal sometime over the next month.\nThis is the first time either side has put a definitive deadline on reaching a deal to bring the months-long trade war that has been disruptive to economies on both sides of the 49th parallel to a close.\n\"We agreed to pursue negotiations toward a deal within the coming 30 days,\" Carney said of Trump in a social media post. \"I'm looking forward to continuing this work at this summit and in the weeks ahead.\"\nThe new commitment to reach a deal soon comes after Trump sounded an optimistic tone earlier Monday, saying he's sure Canada and the U.S. \"can work something out\" on the trade tensions in the coming days.\nWATCH | Trump wants to 'work something out':\n‘I’m a tariff person,’ Trump says at G7 meeting with Carney\n7 hours ago\nDuration 0:54U.S. President Donald Trump said he and Prime Minister Mark Carney have different concepts around trade. Trump reiterated his support for tariffs, saying: ‘It’s simple, it’s easy, it’s precise.’ Trump noted that Carney has ‘a more complex idea,’ and said, ‘we’re going to look at both.’\nTrump said his \"primary focus\" of this G7 summit is \"trade with Canada.\"\nWhile conceding he's a \"tariffs person\" who likes the relative simplicity of imposing broad levies on goods from other countries to raise revenue and try to bring jobs back to the U.S., Trump said Carney has come forward with \"a different concept,\" and it's one \"some people like and we're gonna see if we can get to the bottom of it today.\"\n\"I think Mark has a more complex idea but it's still very good,\" Trump said of some sort of trade pitch Carney has made to the Americans — a proposal that hasn't yet been made public.\n\"I think we're gonna accomplish a lot.\"\nTrump wore a Canada-U.S. flag pin on his lapel at the summit's Monday morning leaders' meeting. (Mark Schiefelbein/The Associated Press)\nFollowing his rosy remarks about Carney and Canada at a White House meeting in Washington last month, Trump said he's \"developed a very good relationship\" with the prime minister and he's hopeful the two sides can work out their issues.\nThis new timeline means Carney will likely forgo hitting back against Trump with steeper retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods after the president hiked global steel and aluminum tariffs from 25 to 50 per cent earlier this month.\nAt the time, Carney said that rate hike was \"illogical\" and \"unjustified\" but he held back from hiking Canada's retaliatory tariffs because the two sides were locked in what he called \"intensive negotiations.\"\nIn an unusual move, Trump was wearing a second pin on his suit lapel.\nBelow the standard American flag pin that is ubiquitous on the chests of U.S. politicians, Trump wore a second with the U.S. stars and stripes crossed with the Canadian flag — a friendship pin. Carney, meanwhile, wore his Order of Canada.\nThe PMO told reporters at the summit that Trump's Canada-U.S. flag pin was not a gift from the Canadian delegation and it was not included in the welcome basket provided to him and other leaders.\nCarney said Monday that Trump had agreed to work toward reaching some form of trade deal within 30 days. (Stefan Rousseau/Reuters)\nA senior government official, speaking on background, said the bilateral meeting was almost entirely focused on advancing the ongoing negotiations over tariffs and Carney's promised overhaul of the bilateral trade and security relationship.\nThe official said Canada was particularly encouraged by \"the length and tone\" of the one-on-one conversation between Trump and Carney, which lasted for 30 minutes of the 70-minute bilateral meeting. Other officials then joined for a broader discussion.\nAsked later by reporters how the talks with Trump went, Carney simply said: \"Fantastic.\"\nCanada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc said the Canadian side is \"confident — I think positive — we made progress\" with Trump and there's a deal coming together \"that would be in the economic interest of both countries.\"\nHe declined to comment on what Trump meant when he said Carney is presenting a more \"complex\" plan.\nSigns of progress\nIn another sign that the discussions could be headed in the right direction, Trump brought along two of his top trade officials — Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer — for his discussion with Carney Monday.\nLeBlanc and Kirsten Hillman, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., met with Bessent and Greer after the Carney-Trump tête-à-tête.  He said the four of them agreed to reconvene later this week.\n\"We feel a sense of acceleration in the discussions in the last couple of weeks — and that's a very good thing,\" Hillman said.\nStill, Hillman stressed there is more work needed to win over Trump in particular.\n\"We have a president who is very convinced of the policy he has around tariffs,\" Hillman said.\nWATCH | Hillman on trade talks:\n‘We should have no tariffs' on Canadian exports to U.S., ambassador says\n3 hours ago\nDuration 0:25Following initial meetings at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alta., on Monday morning, Canada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, says although discussions are ongoing, the government’s position remains aimed at the removal of tariffs on Canadian exports to the Unites States.\nCarney is pushing hard to get Trump's punishing tariffs on Canadian goods lifted — trade action that has already led to job losses in the steel and aluminum sectors and disruption in the auto industry.\n\"Our position is that we should have no tariffs on Canadian exports to the United States,\" Hillman said.\n\"This takes time, it takes a lot of data, it takes a lot of facts. We will continue to talk.\"\nWhile friendly to Carney in his public remarks, Trump railed against former prime minister Justin Trudeau, blaming him for turning what was the G8 into the G7 by removing Russia.\nBut the decision to kick Russian President Vladimir Putin out wasn't Trudeau's — in fact it was made in 2014 before Trudeau was even prime minister. The removal came after Russia invaded Ukraine and illegally annexed part of its territory, Crimea.\nWATCH | Trump on Putin's 2014 removal:\nTrump says it 'was a mistake' kicking Russia from G8\n6 hours ago\nDuration 2:04Speaking to reporters Monday alongside Prime Minister Mark Carney at the G7 summit in Alberta, U.S. President Donald Trump said 'I don't think you would have a war right now if you had Russia in.' Trump also repeated the false claim Justin Trudeau had a role to play in Vladimir Putin being kicked out of the G8 in 2014, when former prime minister Stephen Harper was in office.\nTrump said it was a \"very big mistake\" to leave Putin out because there's so much talk about Russia at these summits and it might have been useful to have him in the room.\nBut when asked if Putin should be invited now or in the future, Trump demurred.\n\"I'm not saying he should at this point because too much water has gone over the dam, maybe,\" he said. \"But Obama and the proud head of your country didn't want him.\"\nAs the host of this 51st G7 summit, Carney was the first to speak at the leaders' meeting, using his time to urge his fellow heads of government to pull together at this \"hinge moment\" in history.\nWATCH | Carney's opening remarks:\nCarney opens G7 at a 'turning point' in history\n6 hours ago\nDuration 4:08Prime Minister Mark Carney opened the G7 in Kananaskis, Alta., Monday morning, saying that the summit comes at a ‘turning point in history’ where the world looks to the G7 for leadership. This first meeting starts two days of discussions between world leaders.\nJust like how past G7 leaders came together to deal with the economic and oil price shocks of the 1970s, the fall of the Soviet Union and the Iron Curtain in the 1990s and Islamic terrorism in the early 2000s, Carney said the most powerful democracies can rally to take on an increasingly \"divided and dangerous\" world.\n\"We all know there can be no security without prosperity and no prosperity without resilience. In a world where shocks flow across the borders, resilience comes from co-operation, co-operation that starts around this table,\" Carney said.\nCarney said he's expecting some \"frank discussions\" over the next two days — an acknowledgement that Trump has a somewhat adversarial relationship with leaders sitting around the table.\n\"We may not agree on every issue, but where we do co-operate — we will make an enormous difference for our citizens and the world,\" Carney said.\nCarney was complimentary of Trump at one point in his remarks, saying the president anticipated \"massive changes\" in the world and is \"taking bold measures to address them\" — an apparent reference to the president's first-term demand that all NATO allies dramatically step up defence spending.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nJohn Paul Tasker\nSenior reporter\nJ.P.

He hopes this year's race will serve as a springboard to making the event one of the most beloved stops on the F1 calendar.\nThis year in Montreal, hospitality tents for F1 teams doubled in size, included 2nd floor\nThe Canadian Press  · Posted: Jun 16, 2025 4:21 PM EDT | Last Updated: 3 hours ago\nAn announced 352,000 spectators, including actor Ben Stiller, Canadian swimming star Summer McIntosh and Montreal Canadiens captain Nick Suzuki, made the trip to Ile Notre-Dame over three sunny days, a stark contrast to the torrential rain and hail that disrupted last year's Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal. (Christinne Muschi/Canadian Press)\nSocial Sharing\nThe spotlight stayed on the track this weekend at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal.\nThat's probably what Jean-Philippe Paradis appreciated most after a 2024 edition marked by access and evacuation issues on Ile Notre-Dame, water damage in TV studios and communication problems with the city's transport agency.\nParadis took over as chief executive officer and president of Octane Racing Group, the Canadian GP promoter, after longtime executive Francois Dumontier stepped down last summer following 30 years on the job.\nParadis said organizers didn't feel added pressure to deliver at this year's Canadian GP but acknowledged his team was eager to make the Formula One event shine.\n\"There was something where people wanted to make it different. We want to bring Canada to a top quartile GP,\" he said. \"There's a path for us to get there, and we wanted to showcase that there is some improvement.\"\nParadis noted that event organizers rolled out the first phase of a three-year plan this year.\nHospitality tents for F1 teams doubled in size and now include a second floor. The entire paddock area was redesigned to also feature a Canadian touch.\nParadis wants to recreate the feel of a downtown Montreal street festival in the paddocks for F1 personnel and VIP guests.\nGeorge Russell fends off Max Verstappen to win Canadian GP where McLarens collide\nTeams were also able to enter the site via the previously inaccessible Victoria Bridge, avoiding the traffic that disrupted 2024 and previous years.\nParadis hopes this year's race will serve as a springboard to making the Canadian GP one of the most beloved stops on the F1 calendar.\n\"If you ask me, why do you wake up every day in the morning? It's to try to make the race really amazing,\" he said. \"Each time, I will improve the fan experience, the personnel experience.\"\nFocus was on successful 2025 event\nThe Canadian Grand Prix is under contract with the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) until 2031.\nParadis denied a rumour suggesting the FIA could terminate the deal as early as 2029. As for a contract extension, he noted many tracks only have one- or two-year deals.\n\"What we wanted to focus on is making sure 2025 is an amazing success we can build on,\" Paradis said. \"As we get success, I'm sure things will fall into place.\"\nOn Tuesday morning, however, Paradis will join Montreal Mayor Valerie Plante, Tourisme Montreal President and CEO Yves Lalumiere and several city officials at Ile Notre-Dame for a news conference \"relating to the Formula One Canadian Grand Prix.\"\nParadis and his team will have a little less time to prepare for the next year's edition of the Canadian GP.\nAfter 2024 'fiasco,' Montreal aims to prove it's still the right city to host Formula 1\nWhy F1 racing is set to become the next big fashion show\nIn the 2026 F1 calendar released last week, the Montreal event is set for May 22 to 24, a few weeks earlier than the traditional June slot.\nThe race will now directly follow the Miami GP, scheduled three weeks earlier. The change helps make the calendar more geographically logical and reflects F1's goal of reducing travel and becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\nParadis doesn't expect the calendar change to affect ticket sales or fan willingness to travel to Montreal for the race.\n\"The month of May might have been a little bit colder this year,\" he said. \"But historically there's about a 1.5 to two C difference.\"\nMost F1 drivers and team principals weren't overly familiar with Montreal's climate beyond their annual grand prix visit, but said they're used to unpredictable weather.\nRace won't 'drastically' change with May date\n\"Even when it's the same time of year here, the weather is quite unstable,\" said Haas team principal Ayao Komatsu. \"You can have a dry race, wet race, really changeable conditions. So, I'm sure teams are fine with it being a different time of year.\n\"I don't think it's going to be drastically different. But I think it's very good for everyone to look at how they can optimize travel logistics.\"\nWilliams team principal James Vowles said he has visited Montreal in the winter.\nMore sports coverage\n\"I definitely don't want to race here in winter. It's freezing cold,\" he said. \"But I think May is perfectly fine.\"\nParadis also said a scheduling conflict with the Indianapolis 500 won't reduce the number of American tourists coming to the event.\nHe expressed the same confidence despite the growing number of Grand Prix races in the United States -- now at three since Las Vegas was added in 2023 -- when Montreal used to be the only North American stop.\n\"Canada is a huge market, right? It's 40 million people,\" he said. \"There's obviously a huge economic market. We serve really well the Northeast of North America. It's an iconic race.\n\"I'm personally waking up every day to make sure that we have a top race, and this race stays here for the next 100 years.\"\nCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices·About CBC SportsCorrections and clarifications·Report error\nRelated Stories\nGeorge Russell fends off Max Verstappen to win Canadian GP where McLarens collide\nMercedes' George Russell takes pole for second straight year at Canadian GP\nLance Stroll cleared to race at Canadian Grand Prix after 'successful medical procedure'\nAfter 2024 'fiasco,' Montreal aims to prove it's still the right city to host Formula 1\nWhy F1 racing is set to become the next big fashion show\nMore sports coverage\nAdd some “good” to your morning and evening.\nGet up to speed on what's happening in sports.

Here's what it offers\nHeritage Minister Steven Guilbeault announced on Monday morning that the federal government will launch the Canada Strong Pass later this week, a move to promote domestic tourism that makes Canada's historic sites and parks free to visit and rail travel less expensive for young people.\nNational historic sites and parks will be free to visit; rail travel cheaper for young people\nBenjamin Lopez Steven  · CBC News  · Posted: Jun 16, 2025 10:54 AM EDT | Last Updated: 5 hours ago\nThe Banff, Alta., townsite in Banff National Park is seen on Thursday, May 15, 2025 (Jeff McIntosh/The Canadian Press)\nSocial Sharing\nCanadian Culture and Identity Minister Steven Guilbeault announced on Monday morning that the federal government will launch the Canada Strong Pass later this week — a move to promote domestic tourism that makes Canada's historic sites and parks free to visit and rail travel less expensive for young people.\n\"Canadians are proud of their country. Canada is strong and it's yours to discover,\" Guilbeault said at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa.\nThe pass, which launches on Friday and ends Sept. 2, doesn't require registration or a physical card. Instead, the benefits will be available upon arrival at parks, national museums and when booking train tickets. Canadians and foreign tourists are eligible.\nIn a news release, Canadian Heritage said the pass includes free admission for all visitors to national historic sites, national parks and national marine conservation areas administered by Parks Canada and a 25 per cent discount on camping fees.\nCanadian Culture and Identity Minister Steven Guilbeault says the Canada Strong Pass isn't a physical document and doesn't require registration. Instead, the benefits will be available upon arrival at national parks and historic sites. (Justin Tang/The Canadian Press)\nThe pass also gives children aged 17 and under free admission to national museums and the Plains of Abraham Museum. For young adults aged 18 to 24, they get a 50 per cent discount.\nChildren aged 17 and under can also travel for free on Via Rail when accompanied by an adult. Young adults aged 18 to 24 get a 25 per cent discount on tickets.\nThe staycation goes Canada-wide: Scrapped U.S. trips could be a domestic boon\nFinally, children get free admission to select provincial and territorial museums and galleries, while young adults aged 18 to 24 get a 50 per cent discount.\n\"Our federal government makes it easier than ever for families to choose Canada when planning their summer vacation, and to fully enjoy the places and experiences that bring us together and that strengthen our country,\" Guilbeault said.\nMore Canadians exploring Canada\nThe federal government's announcement comes as fewer Canadians travel south to the United States — and some of that travel itch is being redirected back to Canada.\nIn May, Statistics Canada released data that showed return trips by Canadians coming back from the U.S. by air dropped by 19.9 per cent, and return via land borders dropped by a whopping 35.2 per cent compared to April of last year.\nMany Canadians have been opting not to visit the U.S. in recent months for a number of reasons, such as increased scrutiny and risk of detention at the border, or as a way to boycott the U.S. given President Donald Trump's trade war threats and talk of annexing Canada.\nA truck drives past the passenger entry point at the U.S.-Canada border in Surrey, B.C., on March 4, 2025. (Ethan Cairns/The Canadian Press)\nIn March, at least eight provinces and territories shared with CBC News that they've seen increased interest from Canadian tourists in visiting their respective regions.\nGuilbeault said the pass is \"about discovering and reconnecting with nature, history and culture of this remarkable country we all share and are proud to call our own.\"\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nBenjamin Lopez Steven\nAssociate Producer\nBenjamin Lopez Steven is a reporter and associate producer for CBC Politics.

(Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\nSocial Sharing\nBenson Boone's hit song, Beautiful Things, was the most popular song across all digital platforms in 2024. Last week, the rock tune charted for 72 consecutive weeks — tying it with Mariah Carey's All I Want for Christmas Is You in the No. 8 slot on the list of longest ever charting singles.\nBoone's new album, American Heart, comes out on Friday. Today on Commotion, host Elamin Abdelmahmoud asks music critics Carl Wilson, Rosie Long Decter and Vish Khanna if Boone can maintain his popularity streak.\nWe've included some highlights below, edited for length and clarity. For the full discussion on more new music from both Neil Young and Sabrina Carpenter, listen and follow Commotion with Elamin Abdelmahmoud on your favourite podcast player.\nWATCH | Today's episode on YouTube:\nElamin: Carl, how has Benson Boone managed to have the longevity that he's had? Because I don't feel like he's an artist who has that staying power, and yet the charts keep saying, \"No, we can't get enough of this guy.\"\nCarl: I mean, the charts move in mysterious ways. But there's also the fact that in the streaming economy, there are things that haven't been figured out yet. And one of them is the ways that singles and albums have lingered in the charts for much longer periods of time than they used to, they open faster and they don't go away. And it's kind of success-breeds-success in this more intense way than it used to. And that, unfortunately, dampens down the dynamism of the charts and of the radio in some ways.\nBenson Boone — along with some other feel-good generic boy singers, like Teddy Swims and currently Alex Warren — is riding this wave of what works as both background music and music you can listen to. You know, he's this nice Mormon boy picking up, trying to do some glam moves and his unitards and his backflips and, God love him! But you look at the boys and go: \"What's wrong here?\" The dynamism of these personalities compared to all of the distinctive personas and ideas behind what young women in pop are doing right now, it brings us back to that question of like, \"What's wrong with the men?\" — that a lot of our culture brings up these days.\nQ with Tom PowerTeddy Swims was terrified to shift from covers to his own songs\nElamin: Rosie, the last time that you were on the show, you called Benson Boone one of your \"belting boys.\" ... When you look at your belting boys — and particularly Benson Boone — does he have what it takes to continue the momentum that he's had for the last little while?\nRosie: Well, he's really trying. I think the reason you heard me come on this show before and have a bit of a soft spot for him was that I think Beautiful Things really has a hard-hitting chorus. I don't hate that song.\nHis new direction, he's going a little poppier, he's moving out of kind of a rock mode. I think he's trying to have a broader appeal. I really am thinking of him as kind of like Harry Styles lite — which is saying something because Harry Styles is already pretty light.\nI think he's very entertaining. I don't know that he has a hook that's going to give him longevity. In the same way that Carl was saying, these boys on the pop charts, they are lacking the personality and the artistry of the women we're seeing on the pop charts. And that said, it can be easier for boys to stick around. They also face less scrutiny, I think.\nI don't think this album is about to hit as big as Beautiful Things, but that might still be enough for him to hang around on the charts and on the radio. And he might just be an ambient name that you're familiar with.\nElamin: Vish, I got to say, your reaction was very dramatic, watching you listen to that new Benson Boone song [Mystical Magical].... It reminded me of the Pitchfork review of Benson Boon's Coachella performance. They wrote: \"Benson Boone is horrible, just godawful, the kind of act that makes you wonder if this whole medium has been worth it.\" So, I think you guys might be in the same kind of territory here. Where do you land on the love-hate for Benson Boone?\nWATCH | Live performance of Mystical Magical on Saturday Night Live:\nVish: One day I was in my office down here and I heard my son's bedroom door open, and I didn't see him, but I heard him say, \"Hey papa, do you know Benson Boone is?\" And I went, \"Yeah, I heard the name, but not really, why?\" And my son went, \"He sucks.\" And I was like, \"OK, thanks for the analysis of Benson Boone.\" I'm at an age where my 13-year-old son and my 10-year old daughter are my cultural barometers about popular culture.\nAnd then I watched the Grammys or Saturday Night Live, and I see this Benson Boone guy flipping around, and I think, \"This guy's not going to make it.\" I mean, if I was a Benson Boone fan and I had tickets to a show on his tour, you know, 15 shows deep, I'd be like, \"He's not making it. Like he's going to twist an ankle or break something and it's going to be over.\"\nYou can listen to the full discussion from today's show on CBC Listen or on our podcast, Commotion with Elamin Abdelmahmoud, available wherever you get your podcasts.\nPanel produced by Stuart Berman.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nSabina Wex\nSabina Wex is a writer and producer from Toronto.\nRelated Stories\nCommotion Will this be the summer of Addison Rae?\nCommotion How NPR's Tiny Desk became one of our favourite places on the internet\nQ with Tom Power Lu Kala is the next big Canadian pop star\nCommotion How Brian Wilson's legacy will live on\nQ with Tom Power Alicia Moffet's pop career had a few false starts.

The city is still struggling with a homelessness and opioid crisis. A 24/7 support centre is far from being up and running, and people on the front lines are trying to patch the holes.\nSocial Sharing\nMore than a year after Belleville, Ont., declared a state of emergency triggered by a spate of overdoses linked to the opioid epidemic, people at the heart of the crisis say the situation has gone from bad to worse.\nBrian Orford lives on Belleville's streets. He's among those who survived last year's batch of tainted drugs — fentanyl, often laced with benzodiazepines or animal tranquilizers.\n\"I'm kind of bummed out because I'm here, I'm on the streets trying to push harder than ever to get a place and get work and everything again,\" said Orford.\nOrford said his girlfriend is pregnant and is staying in one of the very few shelter beds in town, while he sleeps behind the Salvation Army building. They are desperate for housing.\n\"She's got a place to lay her head at night, but I'm still over here and we just want to get a place together and start settling down,\" he said.\nFor now, the state of emergency remains in place and everyone's watching for Belleville's big fix.\nIn May 2023, the city bought an abandoned banquet hall on the edge of town with a plan to convert it into a shelter. It was supposed to open at the end of 2024 or early 2025 and be a 24-hour-a-day hub for services, with temporary beds and housing support alongside counselling and health care.\nBut structural issues have caused delays and the price tag for the building and renovations has ballooned from a projected $3 million to $8.5 million. That includes $5 million from city coffers plus another nearly $3.5 million from Health Canada.\nThe goal now is to open before the end of 2025. In the meantime, the province has allotted $6.3 million per year for three years to fund operational costs, including a service to help homeless clients find housing in the broader region.\nBrian Orford\n15 hours ago\nDuration 0:28Belleville resident Brian Orford speaks with CBC's Omar Dabaghi-Pacheco.\nHomeless numbers rising\nThere's currently just one temporary centre that provides drop-in services in Belleville. The Bridge Hub is overseen by the Canadian Mental Health Association and operates only during the daytime.\nThose living on the streets say it's not enough.\nIn the absence of round-the-clock resources, the number of homeless people on Belleville's streets has risen from just under 200 last spring to roughly 300 this year.\nNeil Ellis, Mayor of Belleville\n15 hours ago\nDuration 0:37Neil Ellis, Mayor of Belleville, speaks with CBC's Omar Dabaghi-Pacheco.\nBelleville Mayor Neil Ellis isn't sugarcoating the scope of the problem.\n\"It's the worst social issue that we're going to face in our lifetime and it's not going to get any better, and that's what scares me,\" he said.\nResidents, many of whom have been feeling the impact of homelessness and addictions issues firsthand, told CBC they worry the permanent hub will get delayed further and the problem will only get worse.\n\"They're saying it's not our problem, it's the government's problem,\" said Belleville resident Laura Corbay. \"Then they'll say it's the police's problem. Then the police will say it's the city's problem.\"\nAaron Crawford, Belleville Police Service\n15 hours ago\nDuration 0:33Aaron Crawford of the Belleville Police Service speaks with CBC's Omar Dabaghi-Pacheco.\n'Band-Aids over bullet holes'\nSara Lougheed is homeless and battling a fentanyl addiction. She was set up with housing in the last year but has since lost it after inviting friends over.\n\"You want to still help your friends and ... bring them in and let them have a shower and things like that, and some people just flip out,\" said Lougheed, who pointed to a lack of support for people transitioning from the streets to housing.\nConst. Aaron Crawford has seen this pattern play out many times: Someone finally lands housing, they invite a friend to come in off the streets, and soon the home has been overtaken by armed drug dealers.\n\"Showing up with guns at two, three in the morning, of course you're going to get the eviction notice posted on your door. No one wants that nonsense next to them,\" he said.\n\"When you introduce that sort of stuff into those people's lives you're going to get complaints, and those people end up getting kicked out and losing their housing.\"\nCrawford said the justice, bail and health-care systems need dramatic reform before things will get any better.\n\"You can throw some mental health workers out on the street,\" he said \"You can throw cops out on the road to try and address these things with. The bottom line is, you're kind of putting Band-Aids over bullet holes.\"\nThe Breakdown | Overdose emergency in Belleville, Ont.\n10 months ago\nDuration 20:19The National takes you to Belleville, Ont., where an overdose crisis has become a local state of emergency.

But here are ten mysteries that science has yet to answer.\nWhat is consciousness? Is time travel possible? What came before the big bang? And more unanswerable questions\nBob McDonald  · CBC Radio  · Posted: Jun 13, 2025 3:39 PM EDT | Last Updated: June 13\nTheoretical physicist Albert Einstein with astronomer John Anthony Miller in February 1931.

(Keystone/Getty Images)\nSocial Sharing\nEvery spring, Quirks & Quarks features our ever-popular listener question show, where we find experts to answer your questions.\nBut there remain some big questions we can't yet begin to answer.\nHere are 10 mysteries that science has yet to unravel.\n1. What is the universe made of?\nThe stars, planets, and galaxies we see in telescopes make up only about five per cent of the known universe. The rest of it is made of dark matter and dark energy. And when scientists use the term \"dark\" that really means: \"We don't know.\"\nDark matter is thought to be an invisible substance that does not give off light but has mass enough to exert the gravitational pull that holds entire galaxies together. Without it, the stars in our Milky Way would fly off in all directions like water drops from a lawn sprinkler.\nQ&AA competing theory to 'dark energy' suggests the universe has different time zones\nDark energy appears to function to speed up the expansion of the universe, operating on large scales to counteract gravity. But beyond seeing its effects, we have little understanding of what it could be.\n2. Are we alone in the universe?\nOur galaxy contains hundreds of billions of stars, and there are hundreds of billions of galaxies out there. Astronomers find that most stars seem to have several planets going around them which makes for at least trillions of other worlds. Yet despite these enormous numbers, we have yet to find a single sign of alien life. It could be hiding underground on Mars, beneath the ice of moons orbiting the giant planets, or on Earth-like worlds orbiting other stars, but as yet there is no hard evidence to show that any life exists other than on Earth.\nThat doesn't mean ours is the only planet with life in the universe; we simply haven't found it yet. But that doesn't stop us from wondering whether it will take the same form as us, and, if we do make contact, how we'd prevent biological cross-contamination and how we would communicate.\nStargazer Junbo Liang from Toronto photographs the Milky Way lighting up clear night sky over Algonquin Park. (Fred Thornhill/The Canadian Press)\n3. How did life on Earth begin?\nWe think that, somehow, billions of years ago, chemicals came together to become self-replicating, evolved into simple cells, then organized into groups of cells, differentiated into tissues in complex organisms, and then one tiny side branch of the rich tapestry that resulted developed brains to contemplate it all.\nThe transition from chemistry to biology was attempted as a laboratory experiment in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey, where the gasses methane, hydrogen and ammonia — along with water — were placed in a sealed flask and exposed to electric shocks for a week. The result was the formation of a dark substance on the inside of the flask that included amino acids, the building blocks of life.\nBut even though the Miller-Urey experiment is now done routinely, so far, no life form has crawled out of the flask. Maybe the lab experiment needs to run for a billion years or so to figure out how the Earth did it.\n4. What is consciousness?\nAs you read this, millions of neurons are firing in your brain, perceiving these dark markings on your screen and forming them into words, sentences and thoughts. Exactly how the electro-chemical reactions taking place inside your skull give you a sense of identity, recreate memories of your past life, trigger curiosity, laughter, love, anger, and fire your imagination is a complete mystery. There are several theories and many ongoing debates just trying to define consciousness in the first place, let alone how it works and how it shapes human existence.\nNor do we know how far this sense of self extends in the tree of life. What do other animals with brains think about?\nTwo chimpanzees kiss at Santa Fe Zoo in Medellin, Colombia.  (Gerardo Gomez/AFP/Getty Images)\n5. What is inside a black hole?\nWe know black holes exist and we even have images of material falling into them at the centres of galaxies. But what ultimately happens to that material is unknown because no one has been through a black hole to find out. Even if they had, we wouldn't know about it because information only flows into a black hole, not out.\nAt the heart of the black hole — also known as the singularity — the laws of physics break down. The gravitational pull from the hole is so strong, an object falling in reaches the speed of light and eventually collapses down to a point. Those conditions are impossible to recreate on Earth.\nSome suggest that a black hole is a gateway to a parallel universe, or that our whole universe itself could be inside a black hole.\nThe collision of two black holes holes — a tremendously powerful event detected for the first time by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational - Wave Observatory (LIGO) — is depicted in this still from a computer simulation. (Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes (SXS) project)\n6. What went bang, and was there anything before?\nThe universe is expanding, growing outwards in all directions every second. If you run time backwards, everything must have been squeezed into something infinitely dense and hot. As with a black hole, it was a singularity — a condition physics can say nothing about.\nWhat was it, and why did it suddenly expand explosively 13.8 billion years ago? Did it come from an earlier epoch when material came together in a big crunch, then rebounded outwards? Or did something come from nothing? In quantum physics, that can happen.\nThe Large Hadron Collider, the world's most powerful particle accelerator, is trying to recreate the conditions at the moments after the Big Bang on a microscopic scale for a few billionths of a second to find what it can reveal about what went bang.\nThe LHCb Muon system at the Large Hadron Collider facility outside of Geneva. (Maximilien Brice, Julien Marius Ordan/CERN via The Associated Press)\n7. Is there a theory of everything?\nEinstein's theories of gravity and general relativity appear to work on the largest scale of the universe. They adequately describe what holds you in your chair and keeps galaxies rotating.\nMarch 11: Encore of Quirks & Quarks' 2005 special celebrating Albert Einstein's impact on science\nQuantum theory works on the scale of the very small, accounting for the behaviour of electrons, protons, neutrons, quarks, neutrons and other subatomic particles. But there is no unifying theory that brings these two realms together.\nThere have been attempts to construct such theories — string theory and loop quantum gravity are two examples. But these attempts have not yet been successful. When a complete theory of everything is developed, it will connect all the forces of the universe, and, presumably, help us understand some of the other questions on this list, such as the origin of the Big Bang and the inner workings of black holes.\nThis June, 1954, file photo shows physicist Albert Einstein in Princeton, New Jersey. (Associated Press)\n8. Is time travel possible?\nYes. You're doing it right now. But only in one direction, and largely at the same rate as everyone else on Earth. It is possible to time travel into the future. According to the theory of relativity, the faster you travel, the slower time passes for you compared to someone standing still. If you returned from a spaceflight that took you close to the speed of light, you would find yourself in the future on Earth, possibly with all of your friends long gone. In other words, time is flexible. Of course our current spaceships cannot come anywhere near the speed of light.\nTime travel in the other direction is a different matter. We have no physics that allow us to understand if that is possible. And apart from that, if it were possible, we might have a problem locating the past. Time travel would also have to include space travel because you would need to go back to where the Earth was at that time. Considering the Earth moves around the sun at about 30 kilometres every second, and around our galaxy at 237 kilometres every second, that's a long trip.\nPerhaps that's where all the tourists from the future are located. They are lost in space looking for the Earth.\n9. How do we provide for a growing human population?\nThere are now thought to be more than eight billion people on Earth. That's up from one billion in 1800 and six billion in 2000. While in much of the world the population growth rate has decreased in recent years due to families having fewer children, our numbers are still expected to reach 10 billion by 2060.\nAugust 20: Best of Quirks & Quarks - Feeding the Future\nThe challenge is to find ways to grow enough food, provide clean water and energy to supply such a large population without exhausting the Earth's resources and undermining the ecosystem that sustains us. The solution is some combination of sustainable technologies and behavioural change.\nThis is more than a problem for science to solve. It is also a political, social and cultural issue.\nIt is believed that the eight billionth human was born on this planet sometime around November 2022. (KieferPix/Shutterstock)\n10. How will the universe end?\nIt will take many, many billions of years, and we don't know for sure, but these are the options that scientists discuss:\nIf the universe continues to expand forever, eventually everything will drift so far apart the distant galaxies will fade beyond our horizon. Eventually all the stars in our galaxy will go out and the universe will slowly cool into the big freeze.\nFive ways the universe might die — including one that could happen at any time\nThat's if dark energy doesn't continue to become more powerful, and everything, including the very fabric of space time is torn apart, in what is called the big rip.\nOn the other hand, if universal expansion stops, gravity could pull the whole thing back together into the big crunch, collapsing the universe into a singularity that perhaps goes bang all over again.\nTime will tell — though let's hope this is one we never find out.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nBob McDonald\nBob McDonald is the host of CBC Radio's award-winning weekly science program, Quirks & Quarks.

An airplane. A parachute. A stunt driver. A nervous advertising manager. And a disaster. Or was it?\nCBC Radio  · Posted: Jun 12, 2025 11:53 AM EDT | Last Updated: June 12\nA red MGB takes an 8000-foot plunge. (Bob Burden)\nSocial Sharing\nUnder the Influence27:26Gone in 60 Seconds: Crazy Automobile Stunt Commercials\nBy the early '70s, foreign sports cars were starting to break into the North American market, and the sleek little MGB was a sexy option in 1973.\nMGB's advertising manager, Bob Burden, wanted a \"blockbuster\" television commercial – as the company was facing increased competition from Japanese imports. The creative director of MGB's advertising agency was a Canadian named Mayhew, and he had a big idea.\nAs Mayhew described it, three competitor cars – a Datsun, a Fiat, and a Porsche – would be racing across the desert, leaving plumes of dust in their wake. Then an MGB would be dropped out of an airplane a mile and a half up in the sky, and fall dramatically to the earth with a parachute. A skydiver, who jumped out of the same plane, would land beside the MGB, hop in, and drive away, leaving the competitors in the dust. Burden just stared at Mayhew, blankly.\n\"But what's the selling point?\" he asked.\nMayhew said, \"MGB. Still one jump ahead.\"\nWith that line, Burden was sold.\nFilming would take place over the Mojave Desert in California, not far from the Edwards Airforce Base, where Chuck Yeager had broken the sound barrier in 1947. The cost of this stunt exceeded anything previously spent on an MGB commercial by a factor of ten. Burden's nervous boss wished him luck, with an undercurrent of: \"Don't come back if it doesn't work.\"\nOn the morning of the shoot, two brand-new, red MGBs were polished and ready. There were dozens of details to contend with. Wind was the biggest factor. But luckily, it was a spectacularly still morning.\nThe FTC insisted the commercial had to be authentic. It had to be a real car that landed and drove away – no tricks – or the commercial could not be aired. So every single detail of the drop and landing had to be calculated to the last millimetre. A small armada of aircraft got ready. Two small Cesnas and a helicopter to do the filming, and a Caribou mother ship to drop the MGB.\nWith the early morning light just right, it was go-time. The planes climbed into the sky and at 8,000 feet, the Caribou opened its huge rear doors and the red MGB slid out. The skydiver jumped. It was a beautiful sight. Both seemed to falling in slow motion. The skydiver's chute opened.\nThen everyone went silent. The car's chute wasn't opening. The car started falling a lot faster than the skydiver. Everyone just stared as the MGB smashed to the ground.\nThe skydiver landed beside the brand-new MGB, which was now a completely flattened pancake.\nBob Burden went pale.\nAs it turned out, the parachute lines had snagged and torn on bolts inside the Caribou, rendering the parachute inoperable. Mayhew, the creative director, just shrugged his shoulders, turned to Burden and said, \"Let's try it again with the backup MGB.\"\nBurden responded saying, \"But I don't have a backup job.\"\nMayhew put his arm around him and said, \"You can only be fired once, whether you destroy one car or two.\"\nWith that inescapable logic, take two was called.\nThe planes lifted to the sky. The Caribou's hatch opened. Gleaming MGB #2 slipped out. The skydiver jumped. And everyone held their breath. Suddenly, the car's chute opened. Then the skydiver's chute unfolded. Both drifted perfectly to the desert floor as the three competitor cars raced toward them. The skydiver landed, hopped into the MGB, and sped away, to the wild applause of one Bob Burden.\nAt the national MGB dealer's meeting later that month, the parachute ad received a standing ovation. The commercial generated press from outlets across the country. It won a top advertising award – and when Bob Burden was asked how they had pulled it off, he replied, in the most understated way, \"It took a couple of goes, but it worked fine.\"\nLittle did everyone know that a \"couple of goes\" meant a \"couple of cars.\"\nFor more stories about Crazy Automobile Stunt Commercials, click or tap the play button above to hear the full episode of Under the Influence.

(Darryl Dyck / The Canadian Press)\nSocial Sharing\nIt took until 13 minutes left in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup final for Connor McDavid to score his first goal of the series, and it was after he and the Edmonton Oilers fell behind 3-0 to the Florida Panthers, on the way to losing and getting pushed to the brink.\nBefore that, he led all scorers with six assists, and only teammate Leon Draisaitl has more points than McDavid's seven.\nOf course, the best hockey player in the world is in the spotlight no matter what he does, and he hasn't been able to break out and put the Oilers on his back thanks in large part to Selke Trophy winner Aleksander Barkov and the Panthers keying in on him defensively and slowing him down at all costs.\n\"It's not really about me — it's about us,\" McDavid said Monday when asked about his play in the series. \"I think everybody has another level, myself included.\"\nCoach Kris Knoblauch thinks it has been a bit of an unfortunate final for McDavid given the amount of scoring chances that just haven't gone in.\nWATCH | Oilers fans eyeing a Game 7 comeback:\nOilers fans eyeing a Game 7 comeback\n2 days ago\nDuration 1:32After suffering a tough 5-2 loss to the Florida Panthers in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup final, the Edmonton Oilers are headed back to the Sunshine State in hopes to tie the series and force a seventh and deciding game. The CBC’s Sam Brooks spoke with Oilers fans after the game who haven’t lost hope in their team.\n\"I think Connor's been one of our best players every single night, and that's what we expect,\" Knoblauch said Sunday.\n\"I've got no issues with his game. Obviously, our team relies heavily on him and Leon and how they're playing, but I think that it's tight checking for everyone and it's not going to be a mid-season game against a non-playoff team when sometimes he's had 10 or 12 scoring chances. Those numbers are obviously reduced playing against a good team like Florida.\"\nThe Panthers have defended McDavid and Draisaitl \"reasonably well,\" according to coach Paul Maurice, who acknowledged two of the NHL's most talented forwards are bound to get their opportunities.\nBarkov's line, with Carter Verhaeghe and Sam Reinhart, has been tasked with playing against McDavid, perhaps to the detriment of offence. That's the job, so Reinhart was noticeably upset to give up that late goal Saturday night.\n\"I'm upset every time they get a goal,\" Reinhart told reporters in Edmonton.\n\"It's a team effort defending guys like that. We've known all series the challenge is there for us. No one really cares in our locker room who's producing each night. It's just a matter that someone is at the right times. And that's what we've had.\"\nScoring early would help Oilers avoid Game 6 elimination in Stanley Cup final: Knoblauch\nStanley Cup final is becoming a showcase for the Edmonton Oilers' Leon Draisaitl\nMcDavid led all scorers through three rounds playing with Zach Hyman on his right wing. Hyman's right wrist was dislocated with ligaments torn on a hit late in the Western Conference final, and left winger Ryan Nugent-Hopkins was bothered by an undisclosed injury during a stretch against Florida.\nLoading up by putting McDavid and Draisaitl on the ice together — the so-called \"nuclear option\" — has not been used as often because Hyman isn't around.\n\"With the absence of Zach Hyman, it makes it more difficult putting those two together because of the depth of our lineup,\" Knoblauch said. \"With what we have right now, to run those two together for long periods of time makes it more difficult for our depth on our team.\"\nThat puts even more pressure on McDavid in Game 6 on Tuesday night to keep the series going, as the Panthers again focus on preventing him from doing anything of the sort.\n\"He's an unbelievable player,\" Barkov said.\n\"He's probably the best player of our generation. You have to be aware of him every single time he's on the ice and you have to try to take the space away from him as much as possible and stuff like that. But at the same time, you just concentrate [on] your own game, your own team game, and play that as well as possible.\"\nCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices·About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications·Submit a news tip·Report error\nAdd some “good” to your morning and evening.\nSubscribe to CBC’s Your Alberta newsletter for a weekly round-up of the best news stories, video and audio content from around your province.\nEmail address:\nSubscribe\nCurrent TimeIgnore this field.

When energetic Mars enters meticulous Virgo on Tuesday, we'll be blessed with a new vibration to work with, and could find ourselves accomplishing our objectives with extra precision and speed. We may also be more inclined to hold ourselves to a higher standard as the warrior planet moves through the mutable earth sign over the next seven weeks  — just try not to lose faith if things don't work out perfectly right away.\nOn Wednesday, the pressure could be palpable as the empathy-ruling moon wanes into her third quarter in touchy Pisces. Evaluating your circumstances from an objective perspective will be key to navigating your relationships with grace during this moody lunation, so be sure to take a moment to think before reacting. Practising restraint will allow you to avoid unnecessary conflict and find the right way forward.\nLater on Wednesday or early Thursday, depending on your time zone, things could get a little foggy as expansive Jupiter squares delusional Neptune. The fantasies that we've created in our minds often don't match up with reality when these heavenly bodies clash, so try not to be too hard on yourself or others. Still, you'll want to be mindful of any romantic narratives you create under this influence — they could steer you down a path toward heartbreak.\nOn Friday, we'll welcome the summer solstice as the spirit-driving sun moves into compassionate Cancer. This will be a beautiful day to gather your friends and loved ones to celebrate the longest day of the year in style, since we'll likely be feeling charged up and ready to enjoy the coming months with open hearts and renewed sincerity. Make plans to kick off the season with a splash.\nThen, dare to dream big on Sunday, when assertive Mars in diligent Virgo sextiles optimistic Jupiter in deep-feeling Cancer. Thanks to this helpful alignment of planets, we'll possess all the strength and inner wisdom we need to take purposeful action. Perhaps this will mean embracing your need to care for others and engaging in acts of service; consider how you can shape the world that you desire by practising generosity and kindness.\nYour special 2025 astrological love forecast\nFinally, if you've been ignoring some of your responsibilities, you may be in for a rude awakening on Sunday night as the ego-ruling sun squares strict Saturn. Think about how you might break up your tasks into smaller steps to avoid getting overwhelmed by your to-do list for the days ahead. Having trouble getting started? Just imagine how thankful the future version of yourself will be once you've put in the effort to get organized.\nHere is your horoscope for the week of Monday, June 16, 2025.\nAries\nDoes it feel like you're on a roll as of late, Aries? If so, you may have found yourself wondering how you can bottle this energy. Take a moment to think about what's helped you find your flow recently so you can create a schedule that supports your energy and productivity over the next seven weeks of Mars in Virgo. Meanwhile, this could be a beautiful time to work on your people skills, particularly if you notice some friction arising within your professional environment. Remember: collaboration, cooperation and communication will help you overcome any obstacles that come your way.\nTaurus\nGet ready to mix things up, Taurus. Your playful side could start to come out this week, inspiring you to nurture your imagination, spice up your schedule and lean into your flirtatiousness. Single Taureans will likely be oozing ethereal confidence and may even pull a few new romantic connections into their orbit. Coupled up? You may find that you're in the mood to surprise your partner. Then, regardless of your relationship status, you could notice your inbox filling up with invitations of all kinds over the weekend. Enjoy spending the next four weeks socializing with your inner circle and becoming more involved with your local community.\nGemini\nMake an effort to be patient when it comes to financial matters this week, Gemini. While you may have been kept waiting for a raise, promotion or payment, you know that emotional outbursts will ultimately do more harm than good. Try to find an outlet for your frustrations instead of getting too frazzled. Meanwhile, a professional partnership or pitch could stall, seemingly without reason. Take solace in knowing that you likely don't have all the information at your disposal right now — and that some closed doors can lead us toward better opportunities in the long run.\nCancer\nWhat's on your plate these days, Cancer? From now through the next seven weeks, your career could pick up the pace, tempting you to add a whole new crop of tasks to your to-do list. But it's crucial to keep an eye on your existing commitments, since your social schedule could also be brimming with activity. Take some time to think before committing to anything, and speak up if you feel like you're being spread too thin. Meanwhile, as your astrological season kicks off, enjoy standing confidently in the spotlight. Your star will be shining brightly over the next four weeks — and you deserve all the praise you're about to receive.\nLeo\nPrepare to take your foot off the gas, Leo. You're about to enter a four-week-long period of rest and reflection, when you'll be encouraged to take a step back from the busyness of the world and think about the habits and relationships that are no longer serving you. Once you've evaluated what you truly want to bring forward in your life, you'll be ready to get back out there with renewed confidence. Meanwhile, keeping a dream journal could help you connect with your intuition and prevent certain negative cycles from repeating themselves. Just ensure your head isn't too far up in the clouds this weekend, or you could end up in hot water.\nVirgo\nAre you ready to command attention, Virgo? From now through the next seven weeks, you could find that your aura is particularly magnetic and that others are happy to listen to whatever you have to share. People in your orbit might even perceive you as more fierce and mysterious than usual; enjoy making a memorable impression and taking up space. Then, over the weekend, you could notice your calendar starting to fill up with a wide variety of social engagements and activities. Try to be intentional about how you spend your free time over the next astrological month.\nLibra\nEveryone needs a little private time to rest and reflect, Libra. And this week, you're invited to retreat to your safe space and think about how you express yourself emotionally and make space for your connections to thrive. Looking back on how you've shown up for others, in particular, may inspire you to re-evaluate how you nurture your relationships — and challenge you to invest more time in yourself. Meanwhile, on the career front, it could start to feel like some of your colleagues are making promises they can't deliver on. Let your keen instincts guide your next moves.\nScorpio\nLower your stinger, Scorpio. From now through the next seven weeks, the company of others will help to keep you motivated and inspired, so consider saying yes to social visits and group activities of all kinds. You may even feel compelled to take on a leadership position in a club or sport during this time. Have fun being part of a collective, and don't be afraid to showcase your skills in the process. Over the weekend, you could also find an adventurous new attitude comes over you. This could be a brilliant time to change up your surroundings or sign up for a class to level up your knowledge.\nSagittarius\nIf something seems too good to be true, it probably is, Sagittarius. Keep this in mind if you find yourself handling domestic matters this week, particularly related to investments, debts or inheritance. You'll be wise to take some extra time to consider all your options before making any decisions. Then, over the weekend, enjoy putting clues together and figuring out puzzles that once left you stumped. Your intuition and ability to read between the lines will be especially sharp from now through the next four weeks — and no subject will be too dark, intense or mysterious to dig into.\nCapricorn\nCould you use a little getaway, Capricorn? Don't hesitate to plan a break at some point over the next seven weeks so you can stretch your wings and see the world. Who knows? Taking a look at how people outside of your community live could be just the inspiration you need to make positive changes to your space and daily routine. Meanwhile, you could find that relationships of all kinds start to take centre stage in your life as summer kicks off, helping you better understand how you fit into the lives of others. Now is a beautiful time to prioritize the needs of your nearest and dearest.\nAquarius\nAre you willing to lay your cards on the table, Aquarius? This week, being radically honest about your expectations could help you avoid conflict or even heartbreak. So make an effort to leave fear behind when opening up with your nearest and dearest — you'll likely find it's best to lead with love when searching for solutions. Meanwhile, you could find your mind shifting into problem-solving mode at work, helping you identify inconsistencies and errors with ease. Rest assured: this keen attention to detail won't go unnoticed, and your colleagues will feel thankful to have you in their corner.\nPisces\nPicking the right partner is often the key to success, Pisces. And from now through the next seven weeks, you'll learn about what qualities make for a truly great fit, especially when it comes to making money. Pay attention to the people who seem to match your energy and understand what you want to achieve, and start imagining what you might create with a real ally on your side. Over the weekend, you could also find your mind overflowing with fresh inspiration and ideas. Enjoy injecting creativity, romance and whimsy into everything you do as the summer season begins.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nBryanna Collier\nBryanna Collier is an astrology and fashion writer.

Toronto Police say no foul play is suspected, but Kumar’s family in India is questioning the circumstances around his death.\nKumar, 22, went missing on May 16. His family in India say they have 'no clear answers' about his death\nShilpashree Jagannathan  · CBC News  · Posted: Jun 16, 2025 4:00 AM EDT | Last Updated: June 16\nSahil Kumar, third from left, poses for a photo with family and friends at the airport in India before his departure to Canada in April 2025. The 22-year-old had just begun his studies in Toronto when he went missing on May 16.  (Submitted by Amit Singh)\nSocial Sharing\nA 22-year-old Hamilton student who was reported missing nearly a month ago was found dead in Toronto, according to police.\nSahil Kumar was last seen on the afternoon of May 16 near Yonge and Dundas streets in downtown Toronto. A recent arrival from India, Kumar had moved to Hamilton in April and was set to begin a web design program at Humber College earlier this spring.\nIn a news release, Toronto police said Kumar's body was found on May 26 — 10 days after he went missing. While the investigation remains open, police said the case \"does not appear to be a criminal matter.\" A spokesperson told CBC that no further information would be released.\nKumar's family, however, says the circumstances surrounding his death raise far more questions than answers.\n\"He was happy. He had no problems. He called home every day and told us he was enjoying his course,\" said Akshay Yadav, Kumar's uncle in India, in an interview translated from Hindi. \"He told us: 'Next time I want to bring grandma with me. It feels good here.'\"\nAccording to the family, Kumar spoke to his parents, brother, and grandmother on the day he went missing. \"That was May 16, in the afternoon. After that, his phone was off,\" Yadav told CBC Hamilton.\nHe called his parents to say hello from the GO train. Then this international student disappeared\nHis roommates initially thought he may have returned home and gone to sleep. But when they realized he hadn't, they began calling and eventually filed a police report. It was issued on May 20.\n\"It felt like the ground had slipped from under our feet,\" said Yadav. \"We had just spoken to him.\"\nOn May 27, they received a message confirming Kumar had been found dead in the water. His body was identified by the family overseas during a video call with police.\n\"We were shocked. It was impossible to believe. Sahil even knew how to swim,\" Yadav said. \"We kept asking, 'Why would he go to the beach? What happened?' But we've gotten no clear answers.\"\nKumar, 22, is seen in a recent photo taken in Canada before his disappearance. The international student from India went missing on May 16 after arriving in Toronto from Hamilton. His family says this was his first time living abroad.  (Submitted by Amit Singh)\nToronto police have not commented on the location where Kumar's body was found or the specific circumstances surrounding his death. The family says communication largely stopped after the body was recovered.\nBased in a small village in India, without the financial means or many Canadians connections, the family says they feel powerless to push for a more thorough investigation or to look privately into the circumstances.\n\"It feels like an injustice was done to us,\" said Yadav. \"We're not wealthy, we don't have the means to fight this.\"\nAkshay Yadav, uncle of Sahil Kumar, says the family is still waiting for answers about what happened to the 22-year-old international student in the days before his death. (Submitted by Akshay Yadav)\nYadav said the family has begun to reach out to other families of international students from India who also went missing recently. They were alarmed to read about one case in Ottawa, where a college student died in April under some similar circumstances, he said.\nThey also connected with the family of Vedatman Poduval, a York University student who was reported missing on June 2 by Toronto police and found four days later, on June 6. While police have only said he was found, the family told CBC News he had died. Yadav said the conversation between the two families underscored the similarities between the cases — young international students, all found in water under unclear circumstances. \"When this happens again and again, it should raise questions,\" Yadav said.\nCBC has asked both Toronto and Ottawa police whether they are investigating any potential patterns across the cases or are coordinating on the cases but did not hear back before publication.\nIf you or someone you know is struggling, here's where to look for help:\nCanada's Suicide Crisis Helpline: Call or text 988.\nKids Help Phone: 1-800-668-6868.

A 2020 study found that expired makeup can contain harmful bacteria, including E. coli.\nHailey Bieber sells makeup brand Rhode to Elf Beauty in $1B deal\nCosmetology group says strict licensing rules for people from outside N.B. will stay\nBeach also recommends that people avoid makeup that contains fragrance.\n\"Fragrance in most circumstances, while it's fun, isn't necessarily fun for the skin,\" she said.\n\"It's probably the number one reason people get a reaction or irritation or even allergic to a leave-on product.\"\nKeep it simple\nOf course, anyone who's visited the beauty section at a department store — or has spent any amount of time looking at skin-care routines on social media — knows the full range of cosmetics can be daunting.\nDermatologist Dr. Julia Carroll recommends her patients use three core categories of skin-care products: cleansers, moisturizers and sunscreen.\nIf needed, individuals can then add specific skin products for conditions like acne or dry or particularly oily skin.\n\"If you looked at my skin-care routine, it probably has a few more things in it, but it's something that I curated over the years to address the concerns that I have about my skin,\" said Carroll.\nCosmetics like lipstick, foundation, concealer, mascara and eyeliner are typically harmless. (Dibyangshu Sarkar/AFP/Getty Images)\nShe recommends against complicated 10-step skin-care routines, since those can damage the skin barrier.\n\"Although you're trying to improve your skin, you may end up with red skin that's irritated and that breaks out more easily,\" she said.\nShe suggests people start with fewer products, giving skin time to adjust to any potential reactions, before adding more products to a routine.\n\"One of the other mistakes people often make is they're just adding multiple things at one time and they try it for a day or two, and then say that didn't work,\" said Carroll.\nAnti-aging creams don't really work — right?\nSkin creams actually can improve skin longevity if used consistently, says Carroll.\n\"I can walk into a room and I can pick out who's been using a retinol cream for their lifetime, if we're looking at 50-year-olds, versus someone who hasn't been, just by looking at the quality of their skin,\" she said.\nThough an anti-aging skin cream won't actually reverse the effects of aging, Carroll says it does have preventative properties.\nWATCH | Quebec chemists warn about children using certain skin-care products:\nQuebec chemists warn about children using certain skin-care products\n6 months ago\nDuration 2:02Quebec's Order of Chemists is warning that some skin-care products, designed for adults and popularized on social media, should be avoided by children because the active ingredients can be harmful to young skin.\n\"If you're 30 years old, what you're doing by using a retinoid is you are increasing your collagen production, so you're preventing more than you are reversing the aging process,\" she said.\nNonetheless, Carroll says she doesn't think tweens and teens need products containing retinoids for anti-aging purposes. \"Absolutely not,\" she said.\nA 2025 study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics found that skin care solutions promoted on TikTok \"offer little to no benefit for the pediatric populations they are targeting.\"\nThis Inuk carver transforms antlers into makeup brushes — each with their own story\n9 makeup trends to try in 2025 according to the pros\n\"Skin care regimens on TikTok are costly, infrequently include sunscreen, and often involve exposure to ingredients that carry a risk of irritation, allergic contact dermatitis, and sun sensitivity,\" the study found.\nBut the risk of using regular moisturizing lotions is relatively low for most people, says Carroll, though people with sensitive or rosacea-prone skin may be more reactive to some active ingredients.\nBeach says people need to be realistic about how quickly over-the-counter cosmetics take effect, noting that it can take up to three months to see meaningful improvements.\nHow does Health Canada fit in?\nIt's worth noting there are rules for regulating the cosmetics industry in Canada.\nA Health Canada spokesperson explained in an email that \"all cosmetics sold in Canada must be safe to use and must meet the requirements of the Food and Drugs Act, and its Cosmetic Regulations.\"\n\"If a health or safety problem is identified after a cosmetic product is on the market, Health Canada investigates and takes appropriate enforcement actions,\" the spokesperson.\nSunscreen is one of the best ways to protect yourself from harmful UV rays, and dermatologists say it's an essential cosmetic to own and wear. (SNeG17/Shutterstock)\nDr. Sunil Kalia, a dermatologist and associate professor at the University of British Columbia, says Canada's cosmetics rules are \"comparable to other country regulations.\"\nHe says sunscreens in particular are more strictly regulated in Canada, than in Europe and Asia.\nHowever, a 2024 article published in the International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences found that the European Union has \"has some of the strictest cosmetic regulations, requiring pre-market safety assessments and prohibiting certain harmful substances,\" drawing contrast with Canada and the U.S.\n\"While Canada has stricter guidelines than the U.S., many products can still be sold without pre-market approval,\" the study authors wrote.\nCanada will add PFAS, which are linked to cancer and other health problems, to toxic substances list\nThe Body Shop Canada sells majority of its business, 100 workers to lose jobs\nBrandi Leifso, founder of  Evio Beauty, which bills itself as a vegan, cruelty-free cosmetics brand, says sometimes Canadian guidelines don't go far enough.\nLeifso says her company goes to great lengths to make sure products don't unintentionally harm customers.\n\"We send it away to third-party labs and we test on humans,\" said Leifso. She says all tests are overseen by dermatologists.\nThe company also ensures its products meet global standards, including those set by the U.S. and the EU.\nFor her part, Beach cautions that consumers should think about why they want to use certain cosmetics before applying them to skin.\n\"Buyer be savvy,\" she said.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nSameer Chhabra\nAssociate Producer\nSameer Chhabra is an associate producer with CBC's White Coat, Black Art radio show and The Dose podcast.

After the speech, she says her principal told her she would not be allowed back to school on Monday. In a statement, the board said no students were suspended as a result of the speech.\nSocial Sharing\nThe valedictorian at a west Ottawa high school says she's been told not to come to school Monday after she made pro-Palestinian remarks during a speech at her commencement ceremony.\nElizabeth Yao largely focused on highlights from the past four years at Bell High School during her speech on Thursday, including a memorable waffle fundraiser and the days spent dozing off while reading Shakespeare.\nHer comments on the war in Gaza came at the end, after a land acknowledgement.\n\"As a commitment to truth and reconciliation, I must acknowledge colonial and genocidal atrocities today, including the massacre of more than 17,000 Palestinian children in Gaza,\" Yao said, breaking off as the crowd cheered.\nThe next day, Yao said she received a call from her principal, who said her statements had \"caused harm\" and told her she shouldn't come to school on Monday.\nThat decision is being criticized by some as going against Ottawa-Carleton District School Board (OCDSB) policy. Yao said she stands by her speech and planned to go back to school on Monday.\n\"I'm a little angry, maybe, at the unfortunate situation, especially since I had connected the situation to the values of the school board and what I had learned throughout my four years of being at the school,\" she said.\n\"I was applying that to being an advocate and making sure that those who are oppressed have a voice in our society.\"\nFrom left to right, Elizabeth Yao, Hanna Abdalla and Janna Awale each graduated from Bell High School in June 2025. Yao said she doesn't regret making the remarks in her graduation speech that acknowledged the deaths of children in Gaza. (Courtesy of Hanna Abdalla)\n'Took focus away' from graduation, says board\nSince the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023, more than 50,000 children have been reportedly killed or injured in Gaza, according to UNICEF.\nIn an email sent to parents after the commencement ceremony, which Yao provided to CBC, her principal wrote that her speech \"intentionally took focus away from the purpose of the event, celebrating the achievement of our graduating class.\"\nBut the escalating war in Gaza was an ever-present concern for her class through their high school years, Yao said, noting that her school has a large Arab and Muslim population.\n\"I have seen it affect the students around me, as they have gone on walkouts and protests in the past in order to make the Canadian government aware of what is going on,\" she said.\nSchool board trustee Lyra Evans told CBC she's been fielding a lot of emails, texts and calls, but none of them were unhappy with Yao's comments.\n\"[They] have been asking how on earth or why on earth are we suspending valedictorians and potentially putting their future in jeopardy with three weeks left to go in school,\" Evans said.\nLyra Evans said she's concerned this decision could have broader consequences on the school board's relationship with the Palestinian community in Ottawa. (Kate Porter/CBC)\nHanna Abdalla, Yao's friend and fellow graduate, said she didn't hear from anyone who was upset with Yao's speech.\n\"I don't think it was fair to [be] putting our valedictorian on blast,\" said Abdalla. \"What about the harm, the daily harm, that Palestinian students back in Palestine go through every day?\"\nCBC asked for an interview with the school's principal, but the OCDSB said they would not be commenting.\nIn an email Monday, an OCDSB spokesperson said the board did \"not feel that commencement ceremonies provide the appropriate forum\" for \"respectful, safe and supportive discussions,\" compared to other unspecified opportunities to do so throughout the school year.\nThey wrote that no students were suspended as a result of the speech. Yao has not responded to questions from CBC about what happened Monday.\n'Anti-Palestinian erasure'\nAfter her situation drew so much attention, Yao was put in touch with the National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCCM), a non-profit advocacy and lobby group.\nNusaiba Al-Azem, director of legal affairs for the NCCM, told CBC she believes the school violated OCDSB policies by both telling Yao not to come to school without officially suspending her and for punishing her for pro-Palestinian statements.\n\"To imply that what [Yao] said was harmful is itself a form of anti-Palestinian erasure and anti-Palestinian racism, which the school board has a specific policy against,\" she said.\nEvans agreed that Yao did not break any rules. She cited the OCDSB's own guidelines, which say \"slogans or symbols that signal solidarity, such as 'Free Palestine' etc. are permitted so long as they don't violate the code of conduct.\"\nChildren face starvation in Gaza as Israel's blockade of food, medication reaches 2 months\nThe school board should revoke the suspension, ensure no mark is made on Yao's Ontario student record, and issue an apology to the broader Palestinian community, Evans said.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nGabrielle Huston\nGabrielle is an Ottawa-based journalist with eclectic interests.

(A24/Atsushi Nishijima)\nSocial Sharing\nCanadian director Celine Song is back with her sophomore film, Materialists. The romantic drama follows a high-end matchmaker (Dakota Johnson) in a love triangle with her wealthy client (Pedro Pascal) and her broke ex-boyfriend (Chris Evans).\nThis film comes after Song received a best picture nomination for her debut film, Past Lives, which is also about a love triangle.\nToday on Commotion, host Elamin Abdelmahmoud discusses with entertainment reporter Jackson Weaver and film critics Sarah-Tai Black and Rachel Ho if Materialists lives up to Song's past work.\nWe've included some highlights below, edited for length and clarity. For the full discussion on two other new films, Boxcutter, and the live-action remake of How To Train Your Dragon, listen and follow Commotion with Elamin Abdelmahmoud on your favourite podcast player.\nWATCH | Today's episode on YouTube:\nElamin: Rachel, when you think about this movie and what Celine Song is trying to do here, what do you like about this story that Celine Song's trying to tell?\nRachel: I think that there's a really long and rich history in literature and cinema of these romantic relationship things. Like, what do women want? What do people want? What do you want from a relationship? Jane Austen did a lot of it. We had the really quirky stuff with Cary Grant and the Golden Age. It's all about feels in the '80s and '90s and the 2000s. Those rom-coms were less about the idea of women being property, or people being property, or relationships — or marriage, more specifically — being a business proposition. The '80s,'90s, 2000s, it was more about chemistry, it was more about: do you actually love somebody? Which is a wild notion.\nAnd then Celine kind of brings it back to what it was before, which is a very age-old question, an age-old predicament of: do you marry for love or do you marry for convenience? Do you marry for security for life, for the safety of being in a partnership like that, [that's] usually economic? So I enjoy that her film adds to that. I think that it's a very realistic way of looking at relationships in 2025, to an extent. I do think that as much as it didn't quite work for me, I think it is a good addition to that really rich tradition of looking at relationships and how they are in a very specific time period. And I think that you could definitely time stamp that thought — the mentality that a lot of the characters have — with 2025.\nElamin: Sarah-Tai, what do you make of the chemistry between Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans?\nSarah-Tai: Chris is obviously one of people's favourite Chrises, he's in the Chris trifecta. Pedro Pascal is the it-boy of the moment — besides being obviously conventionally attractive and all that, he's incredibly charming, like this man could charm like a rubber plant, some people are just good at being likable in relation to people in space and in language. The one thing is that Dakota Johnson is not any of those things. I'm not trying to be mean! I find her offensiveness as a nepo baby actually so inoffensive. Like she could be so much worse, but she's not. She could be so much better, but she's not. I think she's really a two-note actor. I think she has slightly improved over the years. But she just doesn't have a lot of chemistry with Chris and Pedro on screen here. I think Chris and Pedro actually have more chemistry with each other.\nDakota Johnson — I might be projecting here because, like Chris Evans's character, I'm a poor boy — doesn't really have that quality as an actor where you can get past the patina surrounding her performances to something more sincere. Like, I don't know, maybe she's just had too comfortable of a life. But the thing about this film is that it really demands, in specific moments, an ability to perform that sincerity, especially because this is a film that so many of the thematics are specifically about the insincerities of dating and romance. And there's something also about Celine Song's filmmaking style and writing style that really necessitates having an actor who can sit in stillness, who can sit in prolonged moments. And sadly, Dakota Johnson just doesn't have that for me. And I think that that is actually a huge part of why the film wasn't a success for me personally.\nElamin: Rachel started us off by laying out some of the things that this movie's trying to grapple with. Maybe it's closer to Age of Innocence than it is to When Harry Met Sally. There's something about, \"Hey, what is this institution of marriage for?\" That's a hard question to ask in a rom-com, and yet this movie is being advertised as a rom-com. Jackson, is that misleading for this movie to be positioned that way?\nJackson: First off, yeah, because there's almost no \"com\" in this rom-com. There's one scene involving Pedro Pascal in a kitchen crouching, that's funny. But other than that, there's not really any comedy in this rom-com.\nAnd also I think it deals with the artificialities of romance in the modern day in a way that I think actually works in one of Dakota Johnson's two notes because she is inaccessible and she's artificial as a character, which works with her — I agree — nepo acting style. She's inaccessible until maybe a switch at the end. But I do think that there's a depth here, kind of a meta-analysis on how materialistic relationships actually can be and how they are business commodities. And they literally speak about them in this Aaron Sorkin-esque finance bro talk, about like, \"What assets do you have? What debts do you have in love?\" And when you have that kind of baked into Celine Song's, I guess, filmography now after Past Lives, it does, I think, make it something other than a rom-com, at least in the first half.\nYou can listen to the full discussion from today's show on CBC Listen or on our podcast, Commotion with Elamin Abdelmahmoud, available wherever you get your podcasts.\nPanel produced by Ty Callender.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nSabina Wex\nSabina Wex is a writer and producer from Toronto.\nRelated Stories\nQ with Tom Power Past Lives director Celine Song shares the real-life moment that inspired the film's nuanced love story\n'I don't want to do anything else': Dakota Johnson on her path to movie stardom\nGroup Chat The 'daddy' state of mind: what makes Pedro Pascal so watchable?\nCommotion A Nice Indian Boy is a warm, hilarious new romantic comedy\nGroup Chat Is the romantic comedy making a comeback?\nFooter Links\nMy Account\nProfile\nCBC Gem\nNewsletters\nAbout CBC Accounts\nConnect with CBC\nFacebook\nX\nYouTube\nInstagram\nMobile\nRSS\nPodcasts\nContact CBC\nSubmit Feedback\nHelp Centre\nAudience Relations, CBC\nP.O.

(Horse Racing New Brunswick)\nSocial Sharing\nPolice in Woodstock, N.B., are investigating the death of a toddler that occurred during Saturday's harness racing card at Connell Park Raceway.\nIn a social media post late Saturday, police said they were investigating a \"tragic incident\" that resulted in a fatality.\nOn Sunday, Woodstock Police Chief Mark Bennett said police aren't releasing many details \"to protect the integrity of the investigation.\" However, he did say at this point it's being investigated as an accident and \"no criminality is suspected.\"\nBennett said the department's thoughts are with the victim's family and those witnessed and responded to the accident.\n\"It's something … you hope you never have to respond to in your career but it's always a potential,\" he said. \"There's no way to prepare yourself for it. Unfortunately, it's the nature of the job.\"\nTheresa Blackburn, a reporter for the River Valley Sun in Woodstock, said it was a three-year-old boy from the area who was killed.\nShe was in touch with Deputy Police Chief Simon Watts on Saturday.\nWatts confirmed to Blackburn that the accident happened when the boy was struck by the starting gate, she said.\nShe said: \"There really is a pall over the community. I mean it's Father's Day weekend. Harness racing is big here. We're now the hub for harness racing and it's always a joy to have them here when … the horses are running and there's crowds, and it's just devastating and everyone is talking about it but not in a good way. It's just really quite horrifying for everybody right now.\"\nIn Saturday's harness race video, the announcer can be heard calling for an ambulance shortly after the second race begins. It is not clear from the video exactly what happened.\nIn harness racing, the starting gate is attached to a vehicle that guides the horses to the race start.\nInvestigation underway\nRacing continued for the remainder of the afternoon.\nMitchell Downey, president of Horse Racing New Brunswick, said in an email that his organization is assisting in a joint investigation with police, the Atlantic Provinces Harness Racing Commission and New Brunswick Coroner Services.\n\"The entire racing community is deeply saddened,\" he said. \"On behalf of all our participants we wish to express our deepest sympathies.\"\nEvery year there are more than 20,000 races in North America, he said.\n\"Over the last 30 years — 600,000 plus races — something as tragic as this has only happened three times to my knowledge,\" said Downey.\nThe Town of Woodstock's council and staff are \"all deeply saddened,\" Mayor Trina Jones said in an email.\nShe thanked the bystanders who provided help until the first responders could arrive at the scene.\n\"We understand that the general public has a vested interest in understanding what happened, but for the benefit of all it is important that the information is guided by fact and the conclusion of the police investigation,\" she said.\nThe track will remain closed until the investigation is completed.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nRhythm Rathi\nReporter\nRhythm Rathi is a reporter with CBC New Brunswick in Moncton.

His devotion centres around fond family memories and creating new fun ones with friends.\nOrigins of this quest\nAt the age of 10, when his family decided to stop at an Old Spaghetti Factory during a vacation in southern California, Mancini had his first meal at the restaurant. It was love at first bite.\nA month later, in a separate trip, his parents took him on another vacation to Whistler, B.C., where they also ended up at the local Old Spaghetti Factory. This second time around, Mancini noticed how all the chain's global spots were listed in the menu's border.\n\"So 10-year-old me was able to say, 'Hey, in a one-month time span, I've been to two kind of geographically far apart locations,' and I could physically check off the two I'd been to. I saw that there were maybe 40 or 45 others… 10-year-old me said, 'Hey I'm going to try to visit them all.'\"\nMancini keeps track of his spaghetti-inspired travel bucket list with some of the now-outdated menus that listed all the international locations of the franchise.  (Andrew Mancini)\nMancini, 22, says he recognizes that it seems like an odd ambition, but that his parents encouraged him to pursue his spaghetti-inspired travel bucket list.\n\"They kind of laughed,\" he said. \"Some people make an effort to get every national park or every state in the U.S. or every major league baseball stadium… and they said, 'Hey, if you want to make this your own version, you know, go for it.' And I don't think they ever really thought I'd make it… but here we are.\"\nFast food is local food, says journalist who took pictures of McDonald's all over the world\nCulinary students in B.C. are attempting to build the world's largest Nanaimo bar\nTakeaways from his pasta-driven travels\nThanks to his passion for this restaurant chain's pasta, Mancini has had a blast traveling to places he might never have visited otherwise. The final Canadian location from his Old Spaghetti Factory tour he had to cross off his list brought him to Saskatoon. He says the same meal is \"surprisingly\" consistent from the U.S. to Canada to Japan.\n\"Down to the pasta sauce, the garlic butter that comes with the bread, the spumoni that they give you for dessert — it's crazy, when you think about it, that two continents apart, they're still providing the same dishes. In Canada, I'll give it, that they serve basil leaves on top of the pasta's marinara sauce, which they don't in Japan or the U.S.\"\nRestaurant managers across the United States have also invited him to attend the inauguration of new locations. The latest was to Medford, Ore., in late April, where he even met with the founders' son, Chris Dussin. But Mancini said he'd still be a loyal customer even without the special treatment.\nMancini was invited to attend the grand opening of the Old Spaghetti Factory in Medford, Ore., where he met with many of the company's executives and the founders' son Chris Dussin (standing furthest to the right). (Andrew Mancini)\nEsteban Martinez, the current manager of the Old Spaghetti Factory in Saskatoon, said his team was \"very excited\" to welcome this super fan and \"talk about how much he loves the spaghetti,\" particularly \"his love of the marinara sauce.\"\nMartinez gave Mancini a custom shirt that reads, 'I ate at every Old Spaghetti Factory in Canada and all I got is this shirt.' (Andrew Mancini)\nAndrew Mancini has Italian-American roots, but when his relatives back in Sicily hear about his endeavour, he says they \"roll their eyes and not comment on whether or not this restaurant is truly authentic Italian.\"\nWhen he pitches the restaurant to others, Mancini says he's often met with skepticism. But he always has a comeback ready: \"Hey, remember, I'm a quarter Italian, so I have a little bit more ability to say this is good Italian food.\"\nWith only three locations left to visit (Portland, Ore., Seattle, Wa. and Spokane, Wa.), Mancini says he has reflected on nearly completing his feat.\n\"Everyone's been making a joke, 'What happens after I reach the sixty-second? Is life even worth living?'\"\n\"But certainly it's been fun memories along the way, and they do continue to expand every year, so even if I make it to 62 by [this] year's end, hopefully next year or the year after, they'll be a new Canadian or American city to go explore.\"\nThis man has eaten at nearly 8,000 Chinese restaurants — and he's not done yet\nWinnipeg is famous for its Fat Boy burgers.

(Brian Fluharty/Getty Images)\nSocial Sharing\nThe Boston Red Sox traded Rafael Devers to the San Francisco Giants on Sunday in a deal that could shake up pennant races on both coasts.\nDevers' agent, Nelson Montes de Oca, confirmed the deal to The Associated Press. ESPN reported that the Giants are sending Boston a package of players that includes pitchers Jordan Hicks and Kyle Harrison for the 28-year-old designated hitter, who had bristled at his demotion from third base this year.\nThe Giants were one game behind the first-place Los Angeles Dodgers heading into Sunday night's matchup between the NL West rivals. San Francisco shortstop Willy Adames said on the ESPN broadcast that the team found out about 15-20 minutes before the game.\n\"Everybody's so excited,\" he said in an on-field interview while playing the field in the second inning. \"Me, personally, I'm like thrilled to have him on the team. He's one of the best hitters in the game, and to have him on the team, I think is going to help us do a lot of damage in the division. Obviously we need a bat like him in this lineup.\"\nA three-time All-Star who signed a 10-year, $313.5 million US contract with the Red Sox in 2023, Devers is batting .272 with 15 homers and 58 RBIs in 73 games, including a solo shot in Boston's 2-0 victory over the New York Yankees on Sunday that completed a three-game sweep.\nTension with Boston's front office\nBut his relationship with the team began to deteriorate when the team signed Gold Glove third baseman Alex Bregman during spring training and asked Devers to move to DH; he balked before agreeing to the switch. When first baseman Triston Casas sustained a season-ending knee injury, the Red Sox approached Devers about playing the field and he declined, saying the front office \" should do their jobs \" and look for another player.\nA day after Devers' comments to the media about playing first, Red Sox owner John Henry, team president Sam Kennedy and chief baseball officer Craig Breslow flew to Kansas City to meet with Devers and manager Alex Cora.\nThe situation became more difficult when Bregman sustained what the team called a significant right quadriceps injury on May 23.\n\"Everybody around the league, I think, was paying attention to that. When any team is having some kind of drama like that, with a player like Devers — he basically was the face of the franchise,\" Adames said before he was interrupted by Tommy Edman's home run that gave the Dodgers a 2-0 lead.\n\"We're thrilled to have him. Everybody's excited. So we're going to make him feel at home,\" Adames said. \"I feel like it sends a message that we're going to compete. That we're going to do whatever it takes to come over here and win the division.\"\nCanadian Hall to welcome former Blue Jays slugger Bautista and rest of 2025 class\nThe Red Sox have won five out of six against the rival Yankees over the last two weekends to improve to 37-36, but they are still fourth in the AL East, 6 1/2 games behind division-leading New York.\nDevers was 20 when he made his major league debut with the Red Sox in 2017. He helped the Red Sox win the 2018 World Series and led the team in RBIs for five consecutive seasons from 2020-24. He has finished in the top 20 in voting for AL MVP five times.\nDevers is not the first Red Sox All-Star to be traded away: The team sent Mookie Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers before the 2020 season in a salary dump — just a year after he won the AL MVP award and led Boston to a franchise-record 108 wins and its fourth World Series title since 2004.\nBut the Devers deal is perhaps most reminiscent of the 2004 mid-season shakeup when Boston traded disgruntled shortstop — and fan favourite — Nomar Garciaparra to Minnesota.\nThe Red Sox went on to win the World Series that year, ending their 86-year championship drought.\nThis is the latest big move by Buster Posey, a seven-time All-Star who took over as San Francisco's president of baseball operations in September. He signed Justin Verlander to a $15 million, one-year contract in January and Adames to a $182 million, seven-year deal in December.\n\"It makes them better right now, for sure,\" Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw said in a TV interview from the dugout at Dodger Stadium. \"Buster Posey's really doing it. Good for Buster over there. He's going for it. I'd consider Raffy one of the top 10 hitters in the game, at worst. He's definitely a game-changer. It will be interesting to see what position he plays over there.\"\nCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices·About CBC SportsCorrections and clarifications·Report error\nRelated Stories\nNOTEBOOK Blue Jays' Scherzer could pitch in minor league game this weekend\nWander Franco to stand trial starting Monday in sexual abuse case involving underage girl\nBlue Jays place outfielder Varsho on 10-day IL with hamstring strain, activate reliever Swanson\nvideo Toronto Blue Jays prospect Arjun Nimmala speaks to CBC News\nBlue Jays pitching prospect Jake Bloss to have elbow surgery\nMLB reinstates Pete Rose and Shoeless Joe Jackson, making them eligible for Hall of Fame\nAdd some “good” to your morning and evening.\nGet up to speed on what's happening in sports.

The clinic sees a limited number of walk-in patients each day. (Colleen Ross/CBC)\nSocial Sharing\nOriginally published on Oct. 28, 2023.\nWhite Coat Black Art26:30ENCORE: The early bird gets the dermA crowd lines up every weekday at a unique walk-in dermatology clinic in Toronto. People have conditions ranging from severe rashes to potentially cancerous moles, and can’t wait months for an appointment with a skin doctor. Dr. Davindra Singh, who runs the clinic, calls it a dermatology crisis.\nRoger Lang woke up at 3 a.m. on a September morning to drive 200 kilometres for a dermatology consultation.\nHe didn't have an appointment, but the 80-year-old from Belleville, Ont., was hoping to be one of the 60-some early risers lined up outside the Avantderm rapid-access dermatology clinic in Toronto's Distillery District to see Dr. Davindra Singh.\nLang has been waiting since July to see a dermatologist about a severe, itchy rash across his body. He had a dermatology referral from a family physician, but an appointment was a long way off.\n\"One of the doctors I saw said, 'Oh, I see, you've been referred. Oh, good luck with that,'\" Lang told Dr. Brian Goldman, host of White Coat, Black Art, outside the clinic.\n\"He said it could be up to two years.\"\nThe lineup continues through the morning outside Avantderm in Toronto, with some people bringing lawn chairs. (Colleen Ross/CBC)\nWait times for dermatology referrals — for conditions from hair loss to rashes to potentially cancerous moles — have risen to the point that some patients in Toronto and beyond would sooner stand in line at 5:30 a.m. to be seen that morning than wait months for an appointment.\nWith a doctor's referral, the rapid-access clinic visits are covered by the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP).\nDermatologists say a range of factors, including pressures added by the pandemic, have increased demand for care from a limited number of the skin specialists.\nThat morning, Victoria Jenkinson, from Hamilton, Ont., was making a third attempt to get into the clinic in hopes of getting an answer for her rapid hair loss. Ton and Mia Tran, a couple from north of Toronto, both took the day off work to have their pre-school aged daughter seen for a skin rash.\n\"Everybody that's in that line is there because they feel their problem is important, it's urgent, and there's often a lot of anxiety surrounding it,\" said Singh, who runs the clinic, in an interview with Goldman.\nDr. Davindra Singh is the lead dermatologist of Avantderm, a dermatology clinic in Toronto's Distillery District. The clinic operates a walk-in, rapid-access clinic that can see dozens of patients each day. (Brian Goldman/CBC)\nBut, there's a cap on the number of patients staff at Avantderm can see each day.\n\"We try to see as many as we can, but when we get to our limit, we just have to shut it off,\" he said. That day Singh saw around 130 patients, including patients from the rapid-access clinic, pre-booked appointments and follow-up phone calls.\nThousands of melanomas removed\nAdam Welton, 36, visited Avantderm the same day as Lang to have a suspicious mole checked out.\nIt's not the first time the Toronto father has had a mole removed, and his family doctor recommended visiting the rapid-access clinic instead of waiting an estimated four months for an appointment.\n\"Both my wife and I've had little health things over the years,\" he said outside the clinic. \"So when you're talking about something that can be really life changing, it doesn't really seem to be that difficult to come and stand for a time.\"\nSingh, left, shows patient Adam Welton a pamphlet during a consultation for a suspicious mole. Welton visited the rapid-access clinic after being told it would be months before he received an appointment with a dermatologist. (Brian Goldman/CBC)\nOnce in, Singh asked Welton a series of questions: Do you tan or burn in the sun? Have you spent a lot of time in the sun? Is there a family history of cancer? — and examined the mark.\nUltimately, Singh decided the best course of action for Welton was to remove the mole the same day. Singh estimates in the clinic's 13 years, he's removed \"thousands\" of melanomas.\n\"I don't think it's cancer,\" Singh told Welton. \"But if we take it off, I'll send it to the lab, I'll analyze it, and then I'll call you back and I'll give you the results. It takes about four weeks now.\"\nThe DoseMelanoma can be deadly. But experts say it's easy to protect your skin and catch it early\nSingh says a number of challenges have contributed to the expanding wait times.\nAs of 2021, Ontario has about 250 dermatologists, which is up 5.5 per cent from 2018 figures, according to figures from the provincial ministry of health. Nationally, per the Canadian Medical Association, there were around 630 practicing dermatologists in 2019.\nThat small number of specialists are taking on a greater number of referrals as family doctors see more patients virtually, and diagnose and treat fewer conditions in their own offices, dermatologists say.\nSingh, right, removes a suspicious mole from Welton.  (Brian Goldman/CBC)\nToo many referrals, not enough specialists\nLike many issues in the health-care system, Dr. Sam Hanna points to the pandemic as the starting point for the problems in dermatology.\n\"Up until the pandemic started, my waiting list was a month or, you know, a month and a half,\" said Hanna, medical director of Dermatology on Bloor and a spokesperson for the Canadian Dermatology Association.\nBut now, he says family physicians are sending more patients his way — half or more of whom would have previously been triaged, given a provisional diagnosis and potentially treated at doctor's offices for conditions like benign growths, warts, acne and mild eczema. So, it's taking longer for dermatologists to get to patients with concerns like potentially cancerous moles, Hanna said.\n\"The solution can't be, 'OK, we're going to take what the 15,000 [family] docs were doing and turn the pyramid on to the … dermatologists in Ontario,\" Hanna said.\nWATCH | Concerns that longer training will exacerbate Canada's family doctor shortage:\nWill an extra year of training exacerbate Canada's family doctor shortage?\n2 years ago\nDuration 2:29The first three-year family medicine residency is slated to launch in 2027. Some are already sounding the alarm that an extra year of training could worsen Canada's doctor shortages.\nCompounding the problem is a growing number of dermatologists nearing retirement age, Singh said. Nearly 50 per cent of physicians are over 55, while only seven dermatologists are trained each year in Ontario.\nAnd many incoming dermatologists, he says, are going into more lucrative cosmetic practices and offering treatments for wrinkles and sagging jowls.\n\"The thought of doing medical dermatology is just not attractive to them anymore, at least not as much as it used to be, and I think that's a big problem,\" he said.\n\"So we've got an issue with supply, we've got an issue with demand, and we're getting squeezed in the middle.\"\nEngaging government, family docs necessary\nHanna, whose clinic offers both medical and cosmetic treatments, is skeptical that offering cosmetic dermatology is creating a wait time problem. Most dermatologists, including himself, still see patients with potentially harmful skin conditions, he says.\nHe says the problem lies in limited public funding for dermatology, which doesn't train or fund enough of the specialists, and how referrals are made.\n\"What has evolved is a system where if everything is perfect and we don't have a global pandemic, we can sort of squint our eyes and pretend that everything's OK,\" he said.\n\"As soon as you put a stressor on, you realize that … we were hoping for the best forever, and then we didn't get the best.\"\nLong wait to see dermatologist in Cape Breton frustrates patients, doctors alike\nFree skin care checkups in Windsor put patients' minds at ease, says doctor\nHanna says that options like Avantderm's rapid-access clinic, offering service for patients that don't want to wait for referral appointments, can be a useful \"bonus\" solution to wait times in dermatology.\nWhere it breaks down is when that option becomes the primary path for seeing patients.\n\"As an overflow valve, it's breaking,\" he said. \"When you kind of shift to all overflow, when the relief valve is under that much pressure, it just really speaks to the underlying system.\"\nMia, left, and Ton Tran both took the day off work to have their daughter's rash checked out at the Avantderm clinic. (Colleen Ross/CBC)\nSingh wants to better educate other providers — whether that's family physicians or ER doctors — about best practices for dermatology referrals. Engaging governments is also critical, he said.\n\"I'm certainly willing to talk to anyone because I've got inside knowledge of all of this.\"\n'If you have better ideas, just tell me'\nDespite running his clinic for up to 12 hours a day, burnout is far in the rearview mirror for Singh.\n\"I think I passed that years ago,\" he said. \"I don't know what keeps driving me, but I just keep doing this.\n\"But I don't think I can do it forever.\"\nLang, from Belleville, did manage to see Singh on one of those 12 hour days. He says the experience was efficient — like \"an assembly line.\" Jenkinson was also given a diagnosis and treatment for her unexpected hair loss.\nBut the Trans, despite taking the day off work and travelling two hours into downtown Toronto, arrived after the clinic's cut-off time for walk-in appointments. They say they'll be back.\n\"I have to, there's no [other] way,\" Ton told Goldman. \"If you have any better ideas, just tell me.\"\nProduced by Colleen Ross\nAdd some “good” to your morning and evening.\nA vital dose of the week's news in health and medicine, from CBC Health.

The Associated Press did not immediately find a lawyer listed for Gamboa or contact information for his family in public records.\nRedd said the man believed to be part of the peacekeeping team, dressed in a neon green vest, fired three shots from a handgun at Gamboa, inflicting a relatively minor injury but fatally shooting Ah Loo.

(McClelland & Stewart)\nSocial Sharing\nBookends with Mattea Roach20:46For Indigenous players, ice hockey is a ceremony of its own\nBefore becoming a writer, like many kids in Canada, Kyle Edwards dreamed of playing in the National Hockey League.\nEdwards, who grew up on the Lake Manitoba First Nation and is a member of the Ebb and Flow First Nation, has complex feelings towards the game he loves — and how it doesn't always love Indigenous people back.\nEdwards' debut novel, Small Ceremonies, follows a hockey team of Ojibwe high schoolers from Winnipeg, who are chasing hockey dreams and coming of age in a game — and a place — that can be both beautiful and brutal.\n\"There is just a hierarchy in sport, in the same way there is in the world, and I think a lot of times sports is a reflection, a mirror of the real world,\" he said on Bookends with Mattea Roach.\nEdwards joined Roach to share how sports reflect society and how hockey is its own type of ceremony.\nMattea Roach: What kind of a pull does hockey have on you personally?\nKyle Edwards: I think it was probably like my first dream as a kid, other than being a writer. I wanted to be a hockey player. When I was growing up, I wanted to go to the NHL. That did not happen. But I loved it.\nI loved playing the game growing up and I think I always had this sort of conflicting relationship with it just in terms of the different types of violence that are associated with it — mostly on the ice. I think it was where I experienced violence for the first time, both physically and verbally, but I love the game.\nI think it's very beautiful and poetic and I love how much it means to Canadians and Indigenous people. It's held on such a pedestal that I felt like I really wanted to write about it in this book.\nWhat was it like engaging in hockey as an Indigenous person growing up?\nIt was difficult. I grew up on a rez, so you're constantly playing teams from small towns. There's this sort of racial aspect to it, the team from the rez and the team from this small, probably mostly white town and just the history of violence that is Canada. I think it just sort of creates this arena for different tensions and histories that sort of play out on the ice. That was difficult.\nAs a child, there was a time where I just didn't want to be associated with it. But Native people in Canada, Indigenous people in Canada, we just love this game so much. It's really beautiful to see. It brings us together all over the country. There's Indigenous only tournaments all over Canada. Indigenous people in Canada, we just love this game so much.- Kyle Edwards\nI think we just fight through that. Hockey is known for being such an exclusive sport. It's very exclusive to people who can afford it. People who are of a certain social class. Indigenous people aren't often seen as part of that. But we really don't care in a lot of ways. I haven't been to a rez in Manitoba that doesn't have its own hockey rink and hockey rinks are not cheap.\nWhat is the kind of relationship between passion and violence that you wanted to explore in your novel?\nPassion and violence can be kind of closely related and hard to distinguish in this game.\nSmall Ceremonies follows this team that's sort of being thrown out of the league because they're being perceived as too violent. But one of my biggest concerns while writing the book was that people are going to think this is unrealistic, that this could never happen in Canada.\nIt has happened. This is probably the journalist part of me. It's not directly based on this, but around the time that I was going into university in 2017, there was this really good junior hockey team from this First Nation in Manitoba. They were really good.\nThey went on one of the craziest winning streaks that their league at the time had ever seen. And they ended up going out to win the championship.\nThe very next season, all of the junior teams from small white towns voted to separate from all of the teams that were based on First Nations, including Peguis, who had won the championship, to create their own league because they didn't want to travel to these teams anymore.\nThis was only a few years ago. This all happened before I even started writing the novel. I remember reading that and I was like, \"Wow, that's just so typical.\"\nYou probably wouldn't expect that sort of thing. I wanted to evoke that same sort of shock in this story because I feel like there's going to be a lot of people reading this, a lot of Canadians in particular, who think that this is a type of story that would never happen, but it happens all over the country and it happened not too long ago.\nThe title of the book is Small Ceremonies. What does ceremony mean to you and to the characters in the book?\nCeremonies can be anything, things that get you through the day. Definitely, hockey is one of those ceremonies.\nThere are so many characters in the book that have little things that they cling onto on a daily basis that sort of help them just survive in a way. We think of ceremonies as these huge things, but I think they can be quite small.- Kyle Edwards\nWe think of ceremonies as these huge things, but I think they can be quite small and hockey is a ceremony because it brings us together in the same way that powwows and sundances do and other different ceremonial things within Indigenous cultures.\nThere's this chorus of characters and each of them, I hope, has their time to shine in the book and they also have very distinct things — they do different practices and rituals that are just so unique to them.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Schwartz and his New York City-based company have become the lead plaintiffs in a legal battle against Donald Trump and the tariffs his administration has slapped on imported goods throughout the world. (Courtesy of Victor Schwartz )\nSocial Sharing\nWhen Victor Schwartz began his small, New York City-based wine company nearly 40 years ago, he certainly never expected to be facing off against the most powerful person in the world.\nBut Schwartz and his company VOS Selections are the lead plaintiffs in a legal battle against some of Donald Trump's tariffs, in a case which could  have economic implications across the world.\n\"I didn't start my company with the idea of, like, I'm going to sue the president of the United States some day,\" Schwartz told CBC News. \"That was not my goal in life. I just wanted to bring in really nice wine to sell to people that enjoyed them.\"\nYet Schwartz's company was instrumental in landing a serious legal blow against Trump's tariff policies on Wednesday, when a court ruled the administration had exceeded its right to impose some of those tariffs and had to stop collecting them.\nShort-lived victory\nThe victory, however, was short lived when, a day later, a U.S. federal appeals court granted an emergency motion that would allow the administration to continue the tariffs, at least temporarily.\nSchwartz seemed to take the reversal in stride.\n\"That's just part of the process. It's not like we thought we won the case after that decision [Wednesday] This process, we knew was going to be appealed,\" he said.\nA U.S. federal appeals court granted the administration of President Donald Trump an emergency motion that would allow the government to continue to collect the tariffs, at least temporarily.  (Evan Vucci/The Associated Press)\nIn February, Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs across the U.S. border amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.\nLast month, Trump also cited the IEEPA when he imposed what he referred to as \"reciprocal\" tariffs which, he said, were needed to address the U.S. trade balance with other countries. He later suspended those tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to agree to reduce barriers to U.S. exports.\nIn its ruling Wednesday, a three-judge panel at the New York-based U.S. Court of International Trade, found that the president had exceeded his authority when he invoked that act.\nThe ruling came in a pair of lawsuits. One was filed by the nonpartisan Liberty Justice Center on behalf of five small U.S. businesses, including VOS Selections, which import goods from countries targeted by the tariffs. The other lawsuit was filed by 12 U.S. states.\nIlya Somin, a constitutional law professor at George Mason University and one of the lawyers representing the plaintiffs. (George Mason University)\nSchwartz says when the first decision came down on Wednesday he wasn't exactly sure what it meant until a lawyer friend explained it to him.\n\"Then I was pretty elated, and I knew it was a really good thing for everybody, for us, for small businesses across the country, and for world trade, you know?\" he said.\nThe tariffs are \"really just a terrible, terrible impact on what we're trying to do here.\"\nHe celebrated in his Manhattan apartment with his wife, and of course a special bottle of wine, a vermentino from France.\nHis company, which he runs with his daughter Chloe, imports wines from 16 countries and distributes them to neighbouring states. Schwartz says  he runs a family company that works with family operations and family farms in Europe and the U.S.\nAsked to join the case\nSchwartz says he didn't seek legal redress but found out through a family member that Ilya Somin, a constitutional law professor at George Mason University, was going to be bringing a case against the tariffs. Schwartz says he contacted Somin just to tell him about what was going on in his industry and that Somin was very interested to hear his story.\n\"Long story short, they asked me to join the case and then eventually asked me to be their lead plaintiff,\" he said. \"That's really how it evolved. I'm a very unintentional plaintiff here. I didn't go out looking for this fight.\"\nWATCH | U.S. court decisions on Trump's tariffs shows volatility of situation, Canada's finance minister says:\nU.S. court decisions on Trump's tariffs shows volatility of situation: Champagne | Power & Politics\n18 days ago\nDuration 13:19Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne tells Power & Politics two U.S. court decisions that blocked, then reinstated, President Donald Trump's broadest tariffs show Canadians how 'volatile' the trade situation is.\nHe says the first time he read the legal complaint, with his company's name on it, he laughed \"kind of crazily.\"\n\"'VOS Selections versus Trump.' It was like a kind of dream,\" said Schwartz.\n\"It was 'Wow, this is amazing.'\"\nMeanwhile, Somin, the law professor, said in his blog on Thursday that the appeal court ruling was not an indefinite stay, but a temporary block while a decision is made over whether a more permanent stay, pending appeal, should be implemented.\nIf the case eventually makes its way to the Supreme Court, Somin told CBC News that his team is \"guardedly optimistic\" they will prevail.\nCarney welcomes U.S. court decision striking down parts of Trump's tariffs agenda\nTrump tariffs suffer staggering setback in U.S. court\nHe says he was not surprised by Wednesday's ruling.

Corrections and clarifications are noted directly on all digital posts. Updates that significantly change the audience's understanding of a report on any platform are logged on this page.\nJune 12, 2025\nOn June 10, in this episode of the House Party podcast, there was a reference to Canada spending money on programs such as the Canada Pension Plan and employment insurance. In fact, the CPP is administered by the federal government but not funded by it. The CPP is funded by the employers and employees who pay into it. A correction was added to the episode and a notice posted online.\nMay 29, 2025\nA previous version of this video, originally posted to the CBC News YouTube channel, CBC Edmonton website and CBC Edmonton TikTok account on May 26, stated that the Edmonton Catholic School District supported a public survey underway on school library materials. In fact, the school district said in a statement it will participate in the provincial review. The video has been replaced and a correction is included in the text accompanying the video.\nMay 28, 2025\nA previous version of this video, originally posted to the CBC News YouTube channel on May 23, contained a headline that incorrectly stated CBC News had shut down the Real Talk Politiks YouTube channel. In fact, YouTube shut down the channel for violating its policies, following inquiries from CBC News. The headline was corrected and a correction notice was added to the text accompanying the video.\nMay 26, 2025\nOn May 20, CBC News reported on a statement from the United Nations saying that 14,000 Palestinian children risked death from severe malnutrition over the coming 48 hours. The UN later confirmed that it had erred when referring to a report from a partner organization, which estimated that 14,000 Palestinian children risked death from severe malnutrition over the period of the coming year, not the next 48 hours. As a result, and in the interests of accuracy and the public record, CBC News corrected and clarified that information on all platforms where it appeared the following day, once the error was identified.\nMay 23, 2025\nAn article published on the Newfoundland and Labrador section of the CBC News site on Friday, May 23, initially and erroneously reported that Liberal candidate Anthony Germain had won the seat in the federal riding of Terra Nova-The Peninsulas. In fact, Conservative candidate Jonathan Rowe defeated Germain following a judicial recount. CBC News regrets the error.\nMay 15, 2025\nA previous version of this video, published on the CBC News site, YouTube and TikTok, had a section about alleged gerrymandering that included an incorrect statement that some blame the Liberal government. In fact, there was no reference to the government in the source material. The video has been corrected and replaced.\nMay 15, 2025\nA story that aired on the May 14 edition of Yukon Morning about literacy in Ross River, Yukon, described someone as the foster parent of a child. In fact, that child is not in foster care. A correction aired on May 15.\nMay 14, 2025\nThis story, about shifting political views among some Canadian Jews, has been updated to include the margin of error for the survey referenced and to clarify the political activity of one of the interviewees.\nMay 13, 2025\nA fact check video segment on The National, CBCNews.ca, TikTok and YouTube after the English language federal election leaders' debate on April 17, 2025 referred to a study from the Fraser Institute about taxes and income. We reported the study did not take into account inflation or carbon rebates paid to Canadians in its calculation of household income and costs. In fact, the study did include both of those factors in its conclusions. Video segments have been edited to remove the reference.\nMay 8, 2025\nA report that aired on The National on May 5 incorrectly reported the number of hostages in Gaza. As of that date, 59 hostages remain.\nApril 30, 2025\nOn April 16 during a CBC News special following the federal election French-language debate, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was described as an American citizen. In fact, though he was living in the United States, he is a citizen of El Salvador.\nApril 28, 2025\nA story broadcast on the April 24 edition of The National marking Holocaust Remembrance Day referred to Auschwitz as a former Nazi death camp in Poland. It would have been more precise to describe Auschwitz as a former Nazi death camp in occupied Poland.\nApril 17, 2025\nOn April 16, during a live broadcast following the French-language federal election leaders' debate on CBC News Network, chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton said, \"Yes, there have been remains of Indigenous children found in various places across the country…\" As CBC News has reported on multiple occasions, what several Indigenous communities across Canada have discovered on the sites of some former residential schools are potential burial sites or unmarked graves.\nMarch 18, 2025\nOn March 14, CBC News reported that Prime Minister Mark Carney signed an order-in-council to end the consumer fuel charge, or carbon tax, effective April 1. He actually signed a prime ministerial directive. Orders-in-council would be issued later. A correction note was added to the digital story and corrections were broadcast on air.\nMarch 1, 2025\nOn Feb. 23, a graphic appeared briefly on screen on The National referring to the impending release of 600 hostages from Israel. In fact, the 620 Palestinians expected to be released included people who were either detained by Israeli forces in Gaza or jailed in Israel. The graphic was amended for online versions of the program.\nFeb. 25, 2025\nOn Feb. 24, CBC News reported on some platforms that Nunavut's 2025-26 budget projects $2.2 billion in total spending. In fact, the budget projects about $3.1 billion. Corrections were broadcast on programs where the error occurred.\nFeb. 18, 2025\nOn Feb. 16, CBC News reported that Alberta produced about 37,000 pounds of honey in 2023. In fact, the province produced about 37 million pounds of honey in 2023. Corrections were broadcast on radio and television and a notice was posted to the story online.\nFeb. 14, 2025\nOn Feb. 6, CBC News broadcast a video report about the diversion of safe drug supply that included file images recorded inside a London Drugs outlet. In fact, London Drugs is not connected to this story. The images were removed from the video and a note added to the file.\nFeb. 10, 2025\nOn Feb. 7, CBC News reported that the federal government has invested a total of $60 million to support recovery efforts in Jasper, Alta. In fact, the total invested is $160 million.\nJan. 31, 2025\nOn Jan. 30, CBC News incorrectly reported that the 23-year-old son of figure skaters Yegenia Shiskova and Vadim Namunov was among the victims of a plane crash in Washington, D.C. In fact, he travelled separately from his parents and arrived home safely. A correction was broadcast on programs where the error occurred.\nJan. 28, 2025\nOn Jan. 24, CBC News reported on the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp and incorrectly reported the number of Jews who died at the camp. More than 1.1 million people were murdered at the camp. Most of them were Jews. On-air corrections were broadcast on radio and television on Jan. 27.\nJan. 21, 2025\nOn Jan. 19, during an interview on CBC News Network, a guest used the word genocide to describe the actions of Israel in Gaza. As part of her response, our host stated, \"we cannot use that word to describe what is happening…\" In fact, CBC News does not prohibit specific words in our reporting, but instead requires precise attribution and reporting on the debates that shape public policy, including debates about language. This was not made clear in this instance and the host's comment left an inaccurate representation of CBC standards.\nJan. 17, 2025\nOn Jan. 17, CBC News reported on the sentencing of a man who lives in Dawson City, Yukon who sexually assaulted his former intimate partner. The article originally stated that the man, Leslie Ian Weatherston, was the former deputy chief of the Dawson City Fire Department. The article has been updated with a correction to clarify that he is in fact the former deputy chief of the Klondike Valley Fire Department.\nDec. 31, 2024\nOn Dec. 23, CBC News reported on the concerns of residents in the British Columbia Fraser Valley about  illegal dumping on farmland. The original version of the story contained an image of a company vehicle and a construction site that were not associated with illegal dumping alleged in the story. The image was removed from the story. A correction notice was posted to online versions of the video and also broadcast on CBC Vancouver News.\nDec. 6, 2024\nA Dec. 5 story on The National was updated to more precisely refer to an earlier CBC News story, about alleged pressure by India on MP Michelle Rempel Garner and her decision to leave Patrick Brown's Conservative leadership campaign. Rempel Garner denies being coerced and says she left the campaign \"of her own volition.\"\nDec. 3, 2024\nOn Nov. 8, 2024, CBC News reported on violent altercations in Amsterdam involving local people and Israeli supporters of Maccabi Tel Aviv. Our coverage included a short piece of video credited to X/iAnnet distributed by Reuters, a journalistic partner of CBC News, that showed some of the street clashes after the game. After broadcast, Reuters issued two corrections: first, to say it was unclear who was being attacked in that piece of video, and second to more precisely reflect the videographer's explanation that the video showed Maccabi fans as the aggressors. Reuters could not confirm that. A clarification note has been added to all online versions of this reporting.\nNov. 22, 2024\nOn Nov. 20, 2024, CBC Radio's The World This Hour reported that the United States vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. The report said the resolution did not include a demand for the immediate release of Israeli hostages captured by Hamas. In fact, the U.S. vetoed the resolution that did contain a separate demand for the hostages' release. The U.S. State Department said it can only support a resolution that links a ceasefire with the release of hostages. An on-air correction was broadcast on Nov. 22.\nNov. 15, 2024\nSeveral stories on CBC News platforms reported on the \"first human case\" of avian influenza caught in Canada. In fact, it is the first domestically acquired case of H5N1 avian influenza in the country. Two poultry farm workers in B.C.'s Fraser Valley fell ill with H7N3 avian influenza during an outbreak in 2004.\nOct. 17, 2024\nOn Oct. 15, Your World Tonight aired a story about the organization Samidoun, which was declared a terrorist entity by the Government in Canada. The story described Samidoun as a \"registered charity.\" In fact, the group is a non-profit and does not have charity status in Canada. A clarification was aired on Your World Tonight on Oct. 16.\nOct. 9, 2024\nOn Oct. 9, World Report aired a story that stated the Green Party Leader of British Columbia, Sonia Furstenau, was expected to win in the electoral district she's running in, for the upcoming B.C. provincial election. In fact, polls suggested the B.C. New Democratic Party candidate is favoured to win that race in Victoria-Beacon Hill. A correction was aired on World Report on Oct. 10.\nSept. 6, 2024\nOn Aug. 30, CBC News in Newfoundland and Labrador reported on the parole of former RNC officer and convicted sex offender Doug Snelgrove. We originally reported that his parole date was set for summer of 2025. In fact, he would have been eligible for full parole in January of 2025, and his statutory release date is April of 2026. The story was updated and a new headline added. A correction notice was posted to the story. A correction was also broadcast on Here and Now on Sept. 5.\nJuly 31, 2024\nOn June 27, 2024, CBC Ottawa News at 11 aired a story about a former Ottawa neurology resident who misrepresented himself as a fully licensed doctor and provided medical services to dozens of patients during the 2022 Freedom Convoy protests. CBC referred to ivermectin as a \"drug that is usually meant for livestock and is dangerous to humans.\" In fact, there are two forms of ivermectin: one approved for veterinary use and one approved for use in humans to treat parasitic infections. Neither, however, is approved for the treatment of COVID-19.\nJuly 26, 2024\nOn May 22, 2024, families of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas in the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks released an edited series of video clips that were shot Oct. 7. The video was provided to the Hostages Families Forum by the Israel Defence Forces.  It shows Hamas militants with five Israeli female conscripts.  Translation of the Arabic speech on the video was distributed with the video. Based on that translation, CBC News reported that one militant referred to the soldiers as \"women who can get pregnant.\"  CBC News did not independently translate the audio before broadcast and, in fact, that translation is in dispute.\nA clarification note was added to all online versions of this reporting.\nClarifications were also broadcast on radio and television programs where the original story aired.\nMay 30, 2024\nWorld Report aired a story on May 25, 2024 about low water levels at Great Slave Lake. The story said the Mackenzie River drains into the lake. In fact, the river carries water from Great Slave Lake north to the Beaufort Sea. A correction aired on the program on May 30.\nMay 29, 2024\nYour World Tonight aired a story on May 27, 2024 about the delay of funding for a federal government commitment. The introduction to the reporter's story suggested the commitment was for the renovation of a hospital in the James Bay community of Moose Factory. In fact, it was to fund the construction of a new hospital in neighbouring Moosonee, Ontario. An on-air clarification was made on Your World Tonight on May 28.\nMay 22, 2024\nA previous version of this story called the government assistance for Italpasta a subsidy. In fact, it is a loan. The headline and story have been updated.\nApril 15, 2024\nOn April 11, 2024, CBC News reported that final approval had been given to allow for infilling at Dartmouth Cove on the Halifax waterfront. In fact, infilling cannot begin until one final approval has been granted. The story has been updated. On-air corrections were broadcast in Nova Scotia on April 12, 2024.\nApril 5, 2024\nFront Burner aired a story on  April 3, 2024 which included an anecdote about a boy who took his own life after being bullied. In fact, the boy was killed by other children in an attack which investigators say was  planned on social media. That anecdote was removed from the posted episode. An on-air correction was added to  the April 4 episode of Front Burner.\nApril 4, 2024\nCBC News updated the Mar. 27 story, about the mysterious writer behind ISIS-K propaganda, to clarify that ISIS is designated a terrorist group by Canada and other countries, including the U.S. and the U.K.\nApril 3, 2024\nA headline on the CBC News homepage said \"Canada is finally getting a national food program.\" In fact, the program has been announced by the Liberal government, which says it hopes the program will be in place later in 2024.\nFeb. 15, 2024\nThe National aired a story on Feb. 7, 2024, explaining how the Houthis have become major players capable of disrupting global shipping traffic. In that story, CBC reported that Hamas is considered a terrorist organization by several countries and entities, including the United Nations. In fact, the United Nations does not consider Hamas to be a terrorist organization. An on-air correction was broadcast on The National on Feb. 8.\nJan. 12, 2024\nIn a video presenting housing experts' reactions to a Conservative Party video about housing affordability, CBC News incorrectly referred to average monthly mortgage costs when evaluating the video's claim that it takes \"66 per cent of the average monthly income to make payments on the average single-detached Canadian house.\" In fact, the Conservative video's claim refers to median income and home ownership costs, which includes property taxes, utilities and other costs not mentioned in the Conservative video. CBC's video has been edited to remove the inaccurate mortgage comparison and clarify information about the report.\nDec. 11, 2023\nOn Dec. 6, 2023, Front Burner aired a podcast episode about the U.S. Supreme Court case involving Purdue Pharma and a settlement over its role in the opioid crisis. The program made reference to the Netflix movie Pain Hustlers, saying Purdue was depicted in that film. In fact, Pain Hustlers was inspired by a different company, Insys Therapeutics, that also sold an opioid-based pain medication. The original podcast episode was amended. A correction aired in the Dec. 8 episode of Front Burner.\nNov. 9, 2023\nOn Nov. 7, 2023, CBC Newfoundland and Labrador aired an interview about Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami not recognizing NunatuKavut as an Indigenous group, and said the federal government had agreed to negotiate a land claim with NunatuKavut. In fact, the federal government has signed a memorandum of understanding recognizing NunatuKavut's members as Indigenous but it has not accepted a land claim for negotiation from the group. An on-air correction was broadcast on Here & Now on Nov. 9, 2023.\nOct. 27, 2023\nOn Oct. 26, 2023, CBC Radio's The World This Hour reported on a brief Israeli ground raid into northern Gaza and described the raid as an excursion. In fact, the appropriate word is incursion. An on-air correction was broadcast on Oct. 27.\nSept. 20, 2023\nOn Sept. 17, 2023, CBC Radio reported on a newly unearthed document about Nazi extermination camps and referred to one of them as a Polish camp. In fact, the Nazi regime established the camps inside Poland, which was occupied during the Second World War. An on-air correction as broadcast Sept. 19, 2023.\nAug. 18, 2023\nOn Aug. 16, 2023, CBC Radio's The World At Six reported on a new Canadian study about radiation treatment for breast cancer patients and said the study was published in The Lancet. In fact, the study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. An on-air correction was broadcast Aug. 17, 2023.\nAug. 8, 2023\nOn July 5, 2023, the program Canada Tonight with Dwight Drummond reported on funerals for Palestinian militants who were killed during an Israeli military raid on a refugee camp in Jenin. In fact, the Palestinian Health Ministry said the dead included a 16-year-old boy and two 17-year-olds. A clarification was broadcast on July 7 to add their ages and include attribution for that information.\nAug. 1, 2023\nAn Editor's Note was added to the top of this story, published on Aug. 1, about the number of chargers for electric vehicles in Canada. A previous version of the story miscalculated the number of chargers per vehicle and said Canada's most populous provinces were significantly behind the U.S. in charger availability. In fact, the difference varies depending on the province or territory. The story and graphic have been corrected and updated.\nJuly 27, 2023\nOn a July 25 broadcast of World Report, a story about the unrest in Manipur, India, incorrectly identified the Meitei people as majority Muslim. In fact, most Meiteis are Hindu. An on-air correction was broadcast on the program on July 27.\nJuly 26, 2023\nAn Editor's Note was added to The National on a segment about flying the Pride flag on municipal buildings. The report was edited to remove a scene with a township employee who was unrelated to the story, and clarifies that the mayor of Norwich declined a request for an on-camera interview. The Editor's Note is available on the website and YouTube versions of the segment, which aired on June 21, 2023.\nJuly 20, 2023\nOn July 18, 2023, CBC Toronto News at 6 aired a story about World Animal Protection Canada releasing report cards that grade the country's roadside zoos. Ontario's zoos ranked last, for what the organization calls weak and non-existent regulations. The broadcast included video of the Toronto Zoo, which was not among the zoos that were graded. The Toronto Zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and was part of the announcement advocating for stronger regulations in Ontario to protect animals. A clarification was broadcast on July 19, 2023.\nJuly 7, 2023\nCBC News updated this story, published on June 19, 2023, to correct a series of factual errors around the ownership of a liquified natural gas plant, investment in the plant and the economic impact of the plant to the surrounding area. The update also corrects an error in attribution.\nJuly 5, 2023\nCBC News updated this story, published on Jan. 19, 2023, which originally referred to emails allegedly sent by a staffer in Danielle Smith's office to the Alberta Crown Prosecution Service. Based on testimonies by confidential sources, CBC News at the time described those emails as \"challenging prosecutors' assessment and direction on cases stemming from the Coutts border blockades and protests.\" On May 18, 2023, Alberta's Ethics Commissioner Marguerite Trussler released a report that included an investigation of an \"allegation published by CBC that a member of the premier's staff emailed a Crown prosecutor about a case before the courts.\" Trussler reported that she found \"no evidence of such an email,\" adding she can only come to the conclusion, based on the evidence that she has, that \"no Crown prosecutor was emailed directly about any of the cases.\" At the same time, Trussler found that Danielle Smith had contravened the Conflicts of Interest Act in an interaction with the Minister of Justice and Attorney General in relation to Coutts charges, for which Smith has since apologized.\nAfter the Ethics Commissioner's report was released, CBC News reviewed its journalism and re-interviewed a number of sources and parties to the matter. Confronted with the Commissioner's report, our sources have insisted that Crown prosecutors felt political pressure regarding the Coutts cases, but they are not able to confirm that the emails they originally described were sent directly from the premier's office to the Crown. As such, we have updated the story and related pieces, removing references to direct contact between the premier's office and prosecutors — which the premier has vehemently denied. CBC News regrets reporting direct contact by email.\nApril 25, 2023\nCBC Ottawa corrected this story, published on April 24, 2023, about a criminal charge against an organizer of the truck convoy protest.

In fact, property records show the building is owned by Mount View Apartments, which is a separate company and not related to Mountain View Apartments or Realstar Group.\nApril 7, 2023\nOn April 5, 2023, CBC Radio referred to the Gaza Strip being occupied. While Israel continues to control most of the flow of people and goods into and out of the Gaza strip, which to some analysts constitutes a continued occupation, it ended its permanent military presence there in 2005. An on-air clarification was broadcast April 6, and this clarification note was published to specify that Israel doesn't consider Gaza to be occupied.

An on-air clarification was broadcast March 20 on The National.\nMarch 20, 2023\nOn Feb. 21, 2023, World Report on CBC News featured a story about the podcast series, The Witch Trials of J.K.

After the podcast aired, changes were made to the content.\nThe podcast reported that a penalty levelled at the Canadian co-parent company ATCO was described as the largest of its kind in Canadian enforcement history. In fact, the penalty was among the largest of its kind. The podcast also reported that a company called ASL could have made up to $100 million on a contract. In fact, the $100-million figure represents the capital costs of the project and not the profit.\nAn updated version of the episode was posted on Jan. 20, 2023.  Additional information provided by LUMA Energy after publication was added at this time.\nThe headline was changed in the online and podcast version of this story. When published, the headline was \"How a Canadian company became a public enemy in Puerto Rico.\" The headline is now, \"How a Canadian-led company became a public enemy in Puerto Rico,\" to better reflect the leadership of the company.\nJan. 12, 2023\nOn Jan. 9, 2023, CBC Radio's hourly newscasts reported the federal government initially scrapped plans to purchase F-35 fighter jets because of a trade dispute involving Boeing.

In fact, it does not regulate the system, but promotes aviation safety by helping to define international operating standards.\nDec. 20, 2022\nOn Dec. 10, 2022, CBC Radio's The World This Weekend incorrectly identified Sandra Pierre as the director of the charitable arm of the Toronto District School Board.

After the story was published on Dec. 5, 2022, Health Canada corrected their publicly available data to reflect that 1.7 million prescriptions were filled in that year, representing around 120 million tablets. A correction notice was also added to the segment on the website and YouTube.\nNov. 29, 2022\nCBC News corrected this story, published on Sept. 15, 2022, about an Ottawa contractor accused of taking money and not finishing projects.

The story said the photo was taken in April 2022 and that the men — national team manager Hamid Estili and Mahmoud Khazein — attended the party together. A previous version of the story also said Khazein was wanted by the FBI at the time the photo was taken. In fact, the photo appears to be from 2018 and Khazein was indicted by the FBI in July 2021.

In fact, Woo said Canada should avoid condemning China.\nMarch 24, 2022\nA clarification notice was added to The National on a story about the CRTC's decision to ban the Russian news channel Russia Today (RT) in Canada. The piece quotes Slava Levin, the CEO of Ethnic Channels Group Limited, raising concerns about removing channels based on their political leanings. This was intended solely to convey Levin's concerns about the process followed by the CRTC. The story should have made it clear that Levin, who was born in Ukraine, does not support RT and favours the channel's removal in Canada. The clarification notice is available on the website and on YouTube for the segment, which aired on March 16, 2022.\nMarch 10, 2022\nA correction notice was added to a story on The National about the Chinese government promoting social media influencers with pro-government views in an attempt to improve perceptions on how it handles human rights issues.

The headline was also changed to better reflect the overall information in the story.\nMarch 31, 2021\nCBC News has added a correction notice to an investigative documentary by The Fifth Estate called 13 Deadly Hours: the Nova Scotia Mass Shooting, available on the website and on YouTube. The documentary said officers jumped out of a cruiser outside the Onslow fire hall and began firing.

Since then, Nova Scotia's Serious Incident Response Team has found that it was an unmarked police vehicle.\nMarch 22, 2021\nWe updated this story, first published on May 8, 2020, because the original article did not accurately clarify that the COVID-19 pandemic led to the changed visiting hours, and that the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre was following Ministry of Health guidelines that were updated due to the pandemic. The story has also been updated to add references to restrictions imposed by the Timmins and District Hospital, and to clarify that CBC Thunder Bay's research was based on a small random sampling of hospitals across Ontario and not a formal survey.\nMarch 22, 2021\nCBC News updated this story, originally published on April 23, 2020, which did not accurately reflect how the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre was planning for the pandemic. The story has been updated with exact wording from the 2017 Pandemic Influenza Plan. A previous version of this story also said patients with a poor prognosis being admitted to hospital would be left to die. In fact, that is not stated in the plan nor did CBC Thunder Bay practise due diligence in contacting the hospital for clarification on any aspect of the 92-page document. The story did not comply with CBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices.\nMarch 18, 2021\nWe amended this story, posted on March 16, about the discovery of new Dead Sea scrolls to clarify where the scrolls were found.\nMarch 16, 2021\nOn CBC Radio's The World This Hour, in a March 3 story regarding the International Criminal Court's decision to open up a war crimes investigation on Israel and Palestinians, we incorrectly reported that the court would investigate the Palestinians for the kidnap and murder of three Israeli soldiers in May 2014. In fact, the three Israelis were not soldiers and they were killed on June 12, 2014. That date is outside the scope of the court prosecutor's investigation, which is examining allegations since June 13, 2014.\nMarch 16, 2021\nWe removed the content of this Associated Press story, published on Jan. 9, 2021, after AP said it had reported an erroneous account of a phone conversation between U.S. President Donald Trump and an investigative official from the state of Georgia about the U.S. election results. The corrected story is here.\nMarch 5, 2021\nWe corrected this story, first posted on March 1, that said a police cadet was a witness to \"the Taser death of Matthew Fosseneuve at the hands of police.\" In fact, while Fosseneuve died following an encounter with police during which he was Tasered, the Independent Investigation Unit of Manitoba said his death \"resulted from pre-existing conditions to which no police action unlawfully contributed in any degree.\"\nMarch 5, 2021\nWe removed the content of this story, originally published on April 30, 2020, regarding financial statements from the Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre. It contained misleading information that had not been verified by CBC Thunder Bay prior to publication, as is required by our journalistic standards and practices.\nMarch 1, 2021\nWe updated this story, first published on Feb. 26, to correct a statistic that said two per cent of those who identified themselves as Black or African American received doctorates in health sciences in 2017. In fact, the number is 9.5 per cent.\nFeb. 19, 2021\nAn on-air correction was broadcast on News Network's Canada Tonight after the program incorrectly reported that Jean Augustine, elected in 1993, was the first Black MP in Canada. In fact, Augustine was the first female Black MP. Lincoln Alexander was the first Black MP, elected in 1968.\nFeb. 12, 2021\nWe updated this article, first published on Feb. 11, that reported on plans by the Manitoba government to purchase a Canadian-made COVID-19 vaccine. We removed an epidemiologist's statements, which incorrectly compared two companies' vaccine trial processes.\nFeb. 4, 2021\nA story we first published on Jan. 19 has been updated to clarify that there are questions about Michelle Latimer's Indigenous identity claims, to better reflect Latimer's understanding of her identity, and to clarify some details of the suggested legislation.\nThis story was also updated on Jan. 27 to clarify details about the kinds of awards and opportunities author Joseph Boyden has received.\nFeb. 4, 2021\nOn a number of local radio programs on Jan. 21, in a segment about a call for federal legislation to authenticate Indigenous identity in Canada, we mistakenly referred to filmmaker Michelle Latimer as not Indigenous. We should have said her Indigenous identity claims are being questioned.\nJan. 25, 2021\nAn on-air clarification was broadcast on The National to acknowledge incorrect images of the Roberta Place Retirement Lodge in a story the previous evening regarding a COVID-19 outbreak at Roberta Place Long-Term Care. The retirement lodge is a separate building that did not have an outbreak at that time.\nJan. 17, 2021\nAn on-air clarification was broadcast on The World This Weekend to address some issues of balance regarding the vaccination process in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. You can listen to it here.\nJan. 11, 2021\nWe updated this story, first posted in November 2019, reporting on backlash to a Facebook post from Lethbridge Conservative MP Rachael Harder. Our update was to more accurately reflect her views and to better contextualize some of the reactions to her Facebook post.\nCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices·About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications·Submit a news tip·Report error\nFooter Links\nMy Account\nProfile\nCBC Gem\nNewsletters\nAbout CBC Accounts\nConnect with CBC\nFacebook\nX\nYouTube\nInstagram\nMobile\nRSS\nPodcasts\nContact CBC\nSubmit Feedback\nHelp Centre\nAudience Relations, CBC\nP.O.
