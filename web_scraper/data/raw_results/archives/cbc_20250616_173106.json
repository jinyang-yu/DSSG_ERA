The aftermath of an Iranian airstrike on Israel is seen here. (Rami Shlush/Reuters)\nTrump's departure means he will miss the second day of the G7 program, including the visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Trump was set to meet with Zelenskyy and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum for bilateral meetings on the sidelines of the summit.\nA Prime Minister's Office spokesperson said Canada was made aware of Trump's schedule change \"through official channels\" before it was publicly announced.\nUpdatedCarney and Trump commit to reaching trade deal within 30 days\nEarlier Monday, during his bilateral meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump hinted that he might have to leave early when he was asked about bringing Iran to the table.\n\"I think Iran basically is at the negotiating table. They want to make a deal,\" he said. \"And as soon as I leave here, we're going to be doing something. But I have to leave here. I have … this commitment. I have a lot of commitments.\"\nSmoke rises from the building of Iran's state-run television after an Israeli strike on Monday. (The Associated Press)\nTrump arrived in Calgary Sunday evening and took part in the G7 leaders' discussions Monday on the economy and some security matters.\nHe met with Carney for a bilateral meeting Monday morning and had private pull-asides with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.\nTrump left the last G7 meeting Canada hosted in 2018 early to travel to Singapore for a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nJohn Paul Tasker\nSenior reporter\nJ.P.

(DC Studio/Shutterstock)\nSocial Sharing\nDay 69:14How a new breed of 'news influencer' is monetizing spectacle and changing the media landscape\nAmid viral dance trends and cute animal clips, social media feeds are seeing more and more of a new kind of content: news commentary from influencers.\nContent creators have been seen standing shoulder-to-shoulder with traditional reporters at recent events like Sean (Diddy) Combs' trial, capturing content and sharing updates directly with their online audiences on platforms like Instagram and Tiktok.\nThese \"news influencers\" don't work in newsrooms and may have no formal journalism training. But their content — a mix of commentary, current events and reaction videos — is reaching people around the world. But as trust in traditional news outlets declines, experts caution it's important to not only know what they're talking about, but how they're sharing and framing it.\nToronto-based creator Frank Domenic Cirinna, 31, often takes a screenshot of a news article or report, explains what it says and offers his own take.\n\"If I see an article that I think I want to talk about because I have an opinion, I make a video about it,\" he said.\nThat approach has earned him millions of views and over 100,000 followers since he started posting daily in January 2022, during the convoy protests in Ottawa.\nHe's also clear that he isn't a journalist and his content isn't intended to be unbiased or balanced.\n\"I have a full-time job. When I'm done with my nine-to-five, after I've put my kids to bed and cleaned up the house, that's when I make my videos,\" said Cirinna, a teacher with a degree in business and economics.\nFrank Domenic Cirinna is a Toronto-based news influencer who posts regularly on TikTok. (Submitted by Frank Domenic Cirinna)\nNews by timeline, not byline\nAccording to a 2023 Statistics Canada report, more than one-third of Canadians got their news or information that year from social media accounts unaffiliated with government, scientific or news organizations. The report examined how shifts in information sources may fuel the spread of misinformation.\n\"We know people are getting their news and information about current affairs from a variety of sources, including social media influencers,\" said Elizabeth Dubois, a University of Ottawa professor and Canada Research Chair in politics, communication and technology.\n\"These influencers are often able to filter and frame current affairs in ways that resonate with the audiences they've built.\"\nWATCH | News influencers discuss the federal elections and their role in them:\nSocial media influencers discuss their political views\n3 months ago\nDuration 12:41With a growing number of Canadians getting their news from social media, two influencers discuss what they tell their audiences about the upcoming federal election.\nBut while their content can be accessible, it might not follow the same standards for fairness or accuracy compared to a report from a trained and accredited journalist.\nWithout those standards, she said, it becomes harder for audiences to know what they can trust.\n\"There is a fear that the more we have content that looks like it's news but isn't news, the less anybody is going to feel comfortable trusting any news,\" Dubois said. \"It just further undermines trust in our information environment.\"\nTrading polished news for personal voices\nJaigris Hodson, Canada Research Chair in digital communication, acknowledges that many Canadians are turning to influencers not out of ignorance, but because they're looking for voices that feel authentic and speak to their lived experience.\nThis is especially true if they feel traditional media is disconnected or too polished.\n\"Influencers come across as more authentic, more on-the-ground and more trustworthy, because they're often speaking to you in a conversational way,\" she said.\nCirinna believes that perceived authenticity is a key reason audiences gravitate to creators like him.\n\"You've got to remember that at the end of the day, a news organization is a much larger beast than one individual. I'm just some guy and I have opinions,\" he said.\nTo Cirinna, the feeling that you're hearing from a real person, not an institution, is part of what makes influencers feel more relatable than traditional journalists.\n\"People get to know me as me,\" he said. \"How many news broadcasters or journalists do we really get to know beyond them reading off the news?\"\nSeeing isn't always believing\nBut even when content feels trustworthy, Hodson warns that platforms are designed to surface what's most engaging — not necessarily what's most accurate.\n\"It's not just filtering for what you want to see. It's also filtering for you what they want you to see,\" she said.\nWATCH | How social media influences news content and its dissemination:\nHow social media news ban is keeping voters in the dark\n2 months ago\nDuration 4:06A media monitoring organization says the “news blackout” on Facebook and Instagram is blocking crucial updates for voters. CBC Calgary’s Rob Brown reveals new research into how this shift might affect your feed during the election.\nIn an environment where sensationalism and misinformation can spread as quickly as facts, Dubois and Hodson agree: audiences need to take a more active role in how they consume content.\nThat means thinking critically not only about whether something is true, but also why it's being shown, who benefits from us seeing it and what might be missing from the conversation.\n\"It means we have to do some digging into it and not accept it at face value,\" said Dubois.\nCirinna shares that concern, and says that responsible influencers should be encouraging their audiences to diversify their news intake.\n\"A good influencer will constantly tell you that they are not the only person you should listen to,\" he said. \"If they're not encouraging you to go to mainstream media or to hear out different opinions, then they're probably operating in bad faith.\"\nThe backbone behind the feed\nAs the media landscape shifts and newsroom resources shrink, some influencers and independent journalists are stepping into roles to \"fill that gap\" traditionally filled by the press, Hodson said.\nUnless they're doing their own reporting, however, even the most credible news influencer relies on the work of professional journalists and news organizations.\n\"I can't do what I do without people who work at the CBC and other places doing what they do,\" said Cirinna. \"My job doesn't work without journalists doing the real work, the heavy lifting.\"\nThat relationship is exactly why, he says, influencers shouldn't be seen as a replacement for journalism.\nThat doesn't mean Canadians need to avoid influencers or abandon social media. But Hodson says that in a crowded and chaotic information environment, the responsibility to think critically is more important than ever.\n\"Slow down when you're on social media. Try to find other sources, follow up and see what you can do to verify something—especially if you're getting a strong emotional response to the information.\"\nRelated Stories\nTikTok is becoming a popular source for news.
