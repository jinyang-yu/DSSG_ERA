This decision follows a collaborative investigation with Privacy Commissioner of Canada Philippe Dufresne. Edwards stated that the company failed to implement fundamental security measures necessary to protect personal information worldwide.\nNearly 320,000 Canadians and 150,000 people in the U.K. were impacted by the 2023 breach, the commissioners said.\nEdwards said that the U.K. has slapped the San Francisco-based company with a $4.2-million fine over the data breach, but Dufrense said he doesn't have the power to hit the company with monetary penalties.\n\"[The authority to fine companies] is something that exists broadly around the world in privacy authorities and it is something that is necessary. Unfortunately, Canadian privacy law does not yet provide this to me,\" Dufrense said.\nLegal changes have been proposed in the past that would give the privacy commissioner the authority to levy fines, but have never been enacted.

But after all, this is Formula 1 | CBC News Loaded\nEntertainment·New\nBrad Pitt's F1 movie is formulaic. But after all, this is Formula 1\nWhile a little clunky, there is little to nothing F1 actually does outrageously wrong. And given the heart-pounding race scenes, that's enough to make this dad movie stand out.\nRacing flick hits some clunky story-beats, while nailing its racing scenes\nJackson Weaver  · CBC News  · Posted: Jun 17, 2025 12:00 PM EDT | Last Updated: 29 minutes ago\nDamson Idris, left, appears as Joshua Pearce and Brad Pitt is Sonny Hayes in F1 The Movie. (Apple TV+)\nSocial Sharing\nWatching Brad Pitt's new racing movie, F1 The Movie, I am a bit like a Labrador at the beach.\nBecause as I try to follow the racing rules, overdone plot beats and famous faces, I am generally confused, have no idea what anyone is doing, am more than a little annoyed by the music and will probably squeeze in a few opportune moments to nap. But on the whole, I'm still excited to be here.\nDespite the many, many bumps on the road, F1 still manages to roll us across the finish line — something a bit easier perhaps for a genre whose only demand is showing things go really fast.\nFollowing itinerant, woebegone Formula 1 racing alum Sonny Hayes (Pitt), the film hits all the requirements of the genre. Hayes is a down-on-his-luck, grizzled vet with a chip on his shoulder, and when we meet him, he's skipping around the world's racing circuits as a gun-for-hire. Anyone looking for a devil-may-care driver to push them over the edge is enough to get him. What if they can't pay much? Doesn't matter. Money, Hayes assures us, isn't the point.\nSo what is the point? That's a fuzzy proposition — one that only gets fuzzier as his old racing buddy Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem) tracks him down at one of the rathole dive bars he frequents these days. Cervantes is wearing a Gucci suit, but the flash is for show — despite ruling the roost as the owner of the APX F1 racing team, he's currently $350 million in the hole.\nWATCH | F1 The Movie trailer:\nIt gets worse. Cervantes's lead driver has hit the road, his other driver is the renegade rookie Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), and if his pathetic team doesn't manage to win at least one of the nine races left in the season, the board can force Cervantes to sell.\nThis makes Hayes his best bet; or, his best bet after nine earlier options turned him down. In Hayes's favour is his erstwhile superstar status. That is, before a spectacular crash broke a couple of vertebrae and forced him into the relatively slower lanes of NASCAR and off-road racing.\nAt the same time, Hayes's clinically cavalier attitude at least gives Cervantes a shot. But this entails Hayes and Pearce getting over their egos to help one another, instead of turning their souped-up testosterone-mobiles into 300 km/h metaphors for unmanaged inadequacy complexes and chronic intimacy intolerance.\nSo in essence, Ford v. Ferrari. Or Rush. Or, perhaps most similarly, Talladega Nights.\nSonny Hayes (Pitt) reunites with old pal Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem) in F1. (Apple TV+)\nOr really, any racing movie ever made. The films are never about racing per se, but about the romantic ideals of self-destructive masculine pride and will-they-or-won't-they competitive camaraderie. This time, the through-line is something closer to Call Me By Your Name: a mentorship-slash-rivalry between Hayes and Pearce that — for the most part — gives the otherwise formulaic plot some momentum.\nWhich, to be fair, is the least interesting form of momentum on offer when judging a movie promising so much exhilarating action it advertised through a haptic trailer. This is an Imax feature using characters as an excuse for racing, and it shows — primarily, for how much those racing scenes pop.\nWith cameras mounted on the hoods, dashes, rooftops and bumpers of the most popular motorsport in the world, F1 performs best as all good racing movies do: when all the annoying storylines have been dealt with so we can get back to the track, the whole reason we and our dads bothered heading to the theatre.\nThis is good given the fact that the canned, often clunky non-racing scenes alternately drag or work against the film's theme. For example, Hayes's constant flirting with team technical director Kate McKenna (Kerry Condon) might not flesh out either of the characters, but where would we be without a romantic subplot?\nREVIEWThe Life of Chuck — for better or worse — dances to the end of the world\nREVIEWHow to Train Your Dragon: We can get one good live-action adaptation. As a treat\nThe contrived one-liners don't evoke an Ocean's 11 old-school vibe so much as draw attention to how far from classic this film is. Maybe we can excuse Bardem for unironically uttering the line, \"The board is up my ass.\" Or rejigging Talladega Nights' satirical quip \"If you're not first, you're last\" into the more self-serious \"Sometimes when you lose, you win.\"\nAnd what about when McKenna cuttingly remarks, \"They're saying Sonny Hayes isn't a has-been — he's a never-was\"? Well, that one's a bit harder to forgive.\nFor those without deep knowledge of Formula 1, what may be worse is the logic of the races themselves.\nHayes's whole schtick is fudging the arcane rules of the sport to force an advantage — a sort of Moneyball rehash for Pitt, except with fewer whiteboards. For those of us lacking the experiential understanding of how, for example, damaged wings can lead to red flags, it may be a bit hard to keep track of the how or why of it all.\nIf it weren't for the frequently yelled explanations from racing analysts describing just how Hayes has subverted the rules, it may be impossible to follow why he's so impressive at all.\nThe racing scenes in F1 the Movie are scintillating. (Apple TV+)\nOr whether he's ingeniously winning or blatantly losing when he and his partner crash into a barrier. And another barrier. And lose. And lose again. And, infuriatingly, tease the audience with more failure to the point where you wonder whether these are the same guys tailgating you on duller stretches of Highway 1.\nWhich, again, is less important than how fast the cars go. Complaining about the structure feels like a fool's errand — though it would be even more foolish not to mention how the ending seems to invalidate everything that came before. There's a bait-and-switch that takes Hayes's character arc and completely undoes it. The film uses a thousand symbols pointing out how the allure of racing glory has been destroying him, only to then twist them around to say he was always right to yearn for it.\nReviewGran Turismo doesn't quite crash and burn — but it's still barely a racing movie\nIt is the screenwriting equivalent of Fast & Furious actors' contractual requirement that they don't lose fights, in order to ensure they continue looking heroic. It is the character-growth equivalent of having their cake and eating it, too, and then eating seven more. And then opening a bakery.\nIt's a silly, counterproductive narrative failing. But really, who cares? We're here to see cars go fast. And when Pitt's behind the wheel, do they ever.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nJackson Weaver\nSenior Writer\nJackson Weaver is a reporter and film critic for CBC's entertainment news team in Toronto.

(Chelsea Kemp/CBC)\nSocial Sharing\nChinoso Onuke says he thought he was going to die when a fellow student, dressed all in black with a mask, attacked him with a sword inside Brandon's Neelin High School last week.\nSeven of his fingers were nearly severed as he fought off the attacker during the hallway assault on June 10. The 15-year-old says the teen was wearing a long black trench coat, a hat, and a mask with a long beak.\n\"I thought the fit was a little weird, honestly,\" Chinoso said. \"I was wondering like, why would someone come and dress like a witch doctor?\"\nAt first, he thought it was a costume — until the teen pulled out a jagged sword and lunged at him striking him in his stomach.\nMore victims, bloodshed were intended in sword attack at Brandon high school: police\nFormer student says U of Manitoba failed to protect her from dorm room attack by convicted sex offender\n\"He's trying to kill with the last one, like he's going straight here. I grab [the sword] with both hands …  and he tries to pull it away,\" Chinoso said describing the attack. \"I don't release it … I push it away and I run away.\"\n\"I run straight to the office and I'm like, if I don't get to the office right now, I'm cooked.\"\nChinoso was rushed to Winnipeg for more than 10 hours of emergency surgery. He's now recovering at home after undergoing life-saving care to treat wounds to his abdomen, chest, thigh and hands.\nHis mother, Helen Onuke, says watching her son go into surgery was terrifying. His blood pressure dropped as low as 57/24.\n\"No parents should have to go through that. Nobody should have to go through that,\" Helen said.\nThe family believes the attack was racially motivated and is calling for action from school officials, the city and the province. Police say the motive is still under investigation.\nDuring the attack, the school was placed under lockdown. Police say they used a stun gun to subdue and disarm the suspect. A 16-year-old student has been charged with multiple offences, including attempted murder. He's scheduled to appear in court Tuesday.\n\"We know that certainly, the harms that were intended were beyond the individual victim involved,\" said Chief Tyler Bates at a press conference last Wednesday.\n\"We do believe that those intentions were interrupted — that the response of our officers prevented further bloodshed.\"\nBrandon community cadets are seen outside of Neelin High School in Brandon, Man., after police say an incident on Tuesday, June 10, led to the arrest of one teen and medical treatment for another. (Chelsea Kemp/CBC)\nChinoso returned to Brandon on Thursday and visited Neelin the following day, where he saw messages of support written on the sidewalk.\nThose messages mean a lot, he says, because the incident has left everyone shaken.\n\"One of my friends described a scene where they thought I looked dead when I came out of the stretcher. My eyes were closed, covered in blood,\" he said. \"It's a little shocking, I guess, but like, at the moment I thought I was about to die.\"\nDespite what happened, he says he's not afraid to return to school.\n\"Why would I be terrified of going back to a place I like? There's like a 0.01 per cent chance of this happening again,\" he said.\nAccountability needed\nHelen, however, said her sense of safety has been shattered by the attack. She wants justice for her son and for other students to feel safe in school again.\n\"You don't expect a sword in school, not to talk of this Brandon, Neelin,\" she said. \"So what are you going to do to make it safe?\"\nHailing originally from Nigeria, Helen came to Canada 25 years ago.\nParents of teen burned at Saskatoon school question how police, school officials handled multiple warnings\nHer family moved to Brandon in 2018 for her husband's ministry. Their son volunteers at their downtown soup kitchen, Love in the City.\nShe worries the community hasn't shown enough support following what she believes was a racially-motivated attack. Helen said she hasn't heard from the mayor or premier.\nBrandon's Mayor Jeff Fawcett told CBC while he hasn't had a chance to see the family yet, he does plan on visiting. CBC has reached out to the province for comment.\n\"A child almost got slaughtered. Why is everybody sitting on quiet?\" she said.\nRecovery\nChinoso says he'll be spending the summer resting and recovering from his injuries.\nHis hands are bandaged and in casts so he's using an iPad with voice control to pass the time. For the next six weeks, he'll need help eating, dressing and brushing his teeth.\nThen comes rehab.\nOnuke’s hands will be bandaged and in casts for six weeks as he recovers from the attack. (Chelsea Kemp/CBC)\n\"It's going to be a slow process, but we'll see,\" Helen said.\nChinoso hopes to get back to basketball, football, and volunteering, he said.\nBut, school next year won't feel the same, he says.\n\"I can barely still comprehend that even happened,\" he said. \"I look at my hands and be like, no, this is not a dream.\"\n'I thought I was going to die,' says teen recovering from Brandon high school stabbing\n17 hours ago\nDuration 2:37Chinoso Onuke, 15, is now recovering at home after undergoing a 10-hour surgery in Winnipeg.

(Willy Sanjuan/Invision/The Associated Press)\nSocial Sharing\nA doctor charged with giving Matthew Perry ketamine in the months leading up to the Friends star's overdose death has agreed to plead guilty, a plea agreement filed Monday shows.\nDr. Salvador Plasencia has agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.\nFederal prosecutors said in a statement that the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. They said Plasencia is expected to formally plead guilty in the coming weeks.\nAccording to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \"moron\" who could be exploited for money. The physician had been one of the primary targets of the prosecution, along with Jasveen Sangha, a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer. Three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their co-operation.\nPlasencia and Sangha had been scheduled to face trial in August. An email to his attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.\nDoctor who helped get Matthew Perry ketamine pleads guilty\n5 charged in Matthew Perry's death, including his assistant and 2 doctors, prosecutor says\nPerry was found dead by his assistant on Oct. 28, 2023, at age 54. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine, typically used as a surgical anesthetic, was the primary cause of death.\nOff-label treatment\nThe actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression that has become increasingly common. But prosectors have said Perry soon began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.\nPlasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry's death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine, totalling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.\nQ with Tom PowerKeith Morrison opens up about his stepson Matthew Perry's life, death and legacy\nMatthew Perry died of 'acute effects' of ketamine, according to L.A. county medical examiner\nHe also admitted to enlisting the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.\n\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez's plea agreement. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between where Plasencia practised in L.A., and San Diego, where Chavez practised, and exchanged several vials of ketamine, the filings said.\nAfter selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500 US, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's \"go-to,\" prosecutors said.\nPlasencia admitted to visiting Perry's house twice and injecting him with ketamine. He also left ketamine behind and showed Perry's personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, how to inject it, according to Iwamasa's plea agreement. The doctor later met up with Iwamasa and gave him more ketamine for Perry, according to the document.\nPerry was also getting ketamine from Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major dealer and supplied the dose that killed the actor.\nSangha has pleaded not guilty — making her the only one of the five people charged in Perry's death who has not entered a plea agreement. She remains jailed as she awaits trial. Plasencia was freed on bond after his initial court appearances.\nErik Fleming, a friend of Perry who said he acted as a middleman and drug messenger, has also pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with prosecutors.\nNone of the defendants has yet been sentenced. Plasencia's plea deal makes no specific sentencing guarantees.\nPerry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on the megahit NBC sitcom Friends, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing.

Ali Shadmani, who had just been named as the head of the Khatam al-Anbiya Central Headquarters, part of the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\nIsraeli military officials also said fighter jets had struck 10 command centres in Tehran belonging to Iran's Quds Force, an elite arm of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard that conducts military and intelligence operations outside Iran.\nEarlier, the Israeli military had called for some 330,000 residents of a neighbourhood in the city centre of Tehran to evacuate. Tehran is one of the largest cities in the Middle East, with around 10 million people, roughly equivalent to the entire population of Israel. People have been fleeing since the hostilities began.\nWATCH l Some Iranians flee to Turkey:\nPeople try to flee Tehran as airstrikes continue\n14 hours ago\nDuration 2:26Panicked residents of Tehran tried to flee the city after warnings from Israel of more airstrikes and some Iranian missiles managed to get through Israel’s defence systems.\nIsrael says its sweeping assault on Iran's top military leaders, nuclear scientists, uranium enrichment sites and ballistic missile program is necessary to prevent its longtime adversary from getting any closer to building an atomic weapon.\nThe Israeli strikes have killed at least 224 people and wounded more than 1,200 since Friday, according to Iranian officials, though outside groups believe that may be an undercount.\nIsrael's military killed a handful of senior Iranian military leaders in its attack late last week and on Monday boasted that it has \"achieved full aerial superiority over Tehran's skies.\"\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency said Tuesday it now believes Israeli airstrikes on Iran's Natanz enrichment site had \"direct impacts\" on the facility's underground centrifuge halls. It marks the first time the UN nuclear watchdog has assessed damage from the strikes in the underground parts of Natanz, the main enrichment facility of Iran's nuclear program.\nIran has retaliated by launching more than 370 missiles and hundreds of drones at Israel. So far, 24 people have been killed in Israel and more than 500 wounded. The Israeli military said a new barrage of missiles was launched on Tuesday, and explosions could be heard in northern Israel.\nLISTEN l Gregg Carlstrom, longtime Middle East correspondent with the Economist, on what's next:\nFront Burner33:27Israel-Iran strikes: What comes next?\nU.S. not 'in the mood to negotiate,' Trump says\nThe escalation of hostilities between the two rivals is among the pressing matters for leaders at the G7 summit currently taking place in Kananaskis, Alta. On Monday, the leaders released a statement on the conflict.\n\"We, the leaders of the G7, reiterate our commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East,\" it read. \"In this context, we affirm that Israel has a right to defend itself. We reiterate our support for the security of Israel. We also affirm the importance of the protection of civilians.\"\nWATCH l Trump comments en route to D.C. from Kananaskis:\nTrump says U.S. wants a 'real end' to Israel-Iran conflict — not just a ceasefire\n5 hours ago\nDuration 0:51U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One as he returned ahead of schedule from the G7 summit in Canada, reiterated his position that Iran cannot be allowed to have nuclear weapons and took questions about the conflict.\nU.S. President Donald Trump left the G7 summit earlier than expected, with the White House's press secretary citing \"what's going on in the Middle East\" as the reason.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told reporters that discussions were underway on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, but Trump appeared to shoot that down in an overnight social media post.\nTrump says G7 summit departure not linked to any Israel-Iran ceasefire offer\nG7 leaders call for 'de-escalation' in Middle East as Trump leaves summit early\nTrump said in a subsequent post that his departure \"has nothing to do with a ceasefire.\"\n\"Much bigger than that,\" he wrote without elaborating.\nIsrael, with five days of missile strikes, has done considerable damage to Iran and believes it can now deal a permanent blow to Tehran's nuclear program — particularly if it gets a little more help from the U.S. president, who arrived at the White House early Tuesday.\nBut deepening American involvement — perhaps by providing the Israelis with bunker-busting bombs to penetrate Iranian nuclear sites built deep underground or offering other direct U.S. military support — comes with enormous political risk for Trump.\nWhen Israel began its strikes late last week, the Trump administration took pains to insist it had not participated, though it has admitted it has helped with defending Iran's counterattacks.\nSmoke rises from an oil storage facility after it appeared to have been struck by an Israeli strike on Saturday, in Tehran, on Monday. (Vahid Salemi/The Associated Press)\nThe U.S. was preparing for a sixth round of talks with Iran on a nuclear deal at the time. On his overnight flight back to Washington from Canada, Trump suggested he was now less interested in talking with them.\n\"They should have done the deal. I told them: do the deal,\" Trump said. \"So I don't know. I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.\"\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the Israeli strikes have set Iran's nuclear program back a \"very, very long time,\" and told reporters he is in touch with Trump daily.\nUnderground Iranian site out of reach\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi appeared to make a veiled plea Monday for the U.S. to step in and negotiate an end to hostilities between Israel and Iran.\nIn a post on X, Araghchi wrote that if Trump is \"genuine about diplomacy and interested in stopping this war, next steps are consequential.\"\n\"It takes one phone call from Washington to muzzle someone like Netanyahu,\" Iran's top diplomat wrote. \"That may pave the way for a return to diplomacy.\"\nWATCH l Explaining Israel's Operation Rising Lion:\nInside Israel’s nighttime attack on Iran’s nuclear program | About That\n23 hours ago\nDuration 25:39Israel and Iran have been exchanging attacks after Israel targeted military officials and nuclear facilities. Andrew Chang explains how Israel's operation changed the state of play. Then, inside Ukraine’s secret deep strike against Russian bombers.\nIran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, and the U.S. and others have assessed that Tehran has not had an organized effort to pursue a nuclear weapon since 2003. The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly warned that the country has enough enriched uranium to make several nuclear bombs should it choose to do so.\nSo far, Israel has targeted multiple Iranian nuclear program sites but has not been able to destroy Iran's Fordo uranium enrichment facility. Fordo is smaller than Natanz, and is built into the side of a mountain near the city of Qom, about 95 kilometres southwest of Tehran.\nThe site is buried deep underground, and to eliminate it, Israel may need the 30,000-pound GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a U.S. bunker-busting bomb that uses its weight and sheer kinetic force to reach deeply buried targets. Israel does not have the munition or the bomber needed to deliver it; it is currently delivered by the B-2 stealth bomber.\nShops remained shuttered Tehran's historic Grand Bazaar on Monday. (Vahid Salemi/The Associated Press)\nIt has also been reported that Fordo is protected by Iranian and Russian surface-to-air missile systems, and it's unclear if those air defences have already been struck in the Israeli campaign.\nMeanwhile, downtown Tehran appeared to be starting to empty out early Tuesday, with many shops closed. The city's ancient Grand Bazaar was also closed — something that has only happened in the past during anti-government demonstrations or at the height of the coronavirus pandemic.\nOn the roads out of Tehran to the west, traffic stood bumper to bumper. Many appeared to be heading to the Caspian Sea area, while long lines also could be seen at gas stations in Tehran.\nCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices·About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications·Submit a news tip·Report error\nRelated Stories\nTrump says G7 summit departure not linked to any Israel-Iran ceasefire offer\nFooter Links\nMy Account\nProfile\nCBC Gem\nNewsletters\nAbout CBC Accounts\nConnect with CBC\nFacebook\nX\nYouTube\nInstagram\nMobile\nRSS\nPodcasts\nContact CBC\nSubmit Feedback\nHelp Centre\nAudience Relations, CBC\nP.O.

(Ethan Cairns/The Canadian Press)\nMany Canadians have been opting not to visit the U.S. in recent months for a number of reasons, such as increased scrutiny and risk of detention at the border, or as a way to boycott the U.S. given President Donald Trump's trade war threats and talk of annexing Canada.\nIn March, at least eight provinces and territories shared with CBC News that they've seen increased interest from Canadian tourists in visiting their respective regions.\nGuilbeault said the pass is \"about discovering and reconnecting with nature, history and culture of this remarkable country we all share and are proud to call our own.\"\nWATCH | Canada Strong Pass includes free and discounted entry to some popular tourist sites — but there are concerns about overwhelming locations:\nGovernment launches Canada Strong Pass to promote tourism\n14 hours ago\nDuration 2:01The federal government has announced details of the Canada Strong Pass, aimed at promoting domestic tourism.

Thompson said in a news conference Monday that the man charged with killing state representative Melissa Hortman and her husband and wounding state Senator John A. Hoffman and his wife went to the homes of two other legislators on the night of the attacks.  (George Walker IV/The Associated Press)\nSocial Sharing\nThe man accused of killing a Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another went to the homes of two other legislators on the night of the shootings, intending to inflict more carnage against those on his hit list, a federal prosecutor said Monday.\nBut one of the other lawmakers was on vacation and the accused left the other house after police arrived early Saturday, acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said at a press conference.\nLaw enforcement officers, including local police, sheriffs and the FBI, stage in the Brooklyn Park neighbourhood where Hortman lived on Saturday. (Alex Kormann/Star Tribune/The Associated Press)\nVance Boelter meticulously planned out the attacks, carrying out surveillance missions, taking notes on the homes and people he targeted and disguising himself as a police officer on the night of the attacks, Thompson said.\n\"It is no exaggeration to say that his crimes are the stuff of nightmares,\" he said.\nBoelter surrendered to police Sunday after they found him in the woods near his home following a massive manhunt over nearly two days that began near Minneapolis. He is accused of posing as an officer and fatally shooting former U.S. Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs.\nAuthorities say he also shot Sen. John Hoffman, a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, who lived just a few kilometres away.\nHoffman, left, and Hortman were shot in their homes on Saturday. Vance Boelter was taken into custody on Sunday and later charged with murder and attempted murder in connection with the shootings. (Minnesota Legislature/The Associated Press)\nFederal prosecutors announced Monday that they have charged Boelter, 57, with federal murder, stalking offences. He already faces state charges, including murder and attempted murder.\nBoelter had many notebooks full of plans and made efforts to find the addresses of his victims and their family members, Thompson said. But authorities have not found any writings that would \"clearly identify what motivated him,\" he said. Though the targets were Democrats and elected officials, Thompson said it was too soon to speculate on any sort of political ideology that could explain his motives.\nAuthorities declined to name the two other elected officials whom Boelter allegedly stalked but who escaped harm. But they said it was clear the shootings were politically motivated.\n\"This was a targeted attack against individuals who answered the call to public service,\" said Alvin Winston, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Minneapolis field office. The resulting search, he said, was the largest search for a suspect in the history of the state.\nThis booking photo provided by the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office shows Boelter in Green Isle, Minn., on Sunday. (Hennepin County Sheriff's Office/The Associated Press)\nBoelter's wife consented to a search of her phone by law enforcement, according to an FBI affidavit that cites from a text Boelter sent to a family group chat: \"Dad went to war last night ... I don't wanna say more because I don't wanna implicate anybody.\"\nHis wife got another text that said: \"Words are not gonna explain how sorry I am for this situation ... there's gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy, and I don't want you guys around,\" the affidavit said.\nSuspect caught in Minnesota woods near his home\nAt one point, Boelter bought an electronic bike and a Buick sedan from someone he met at a bus stop in north Minneapolis, the federal affidavit said. Police found the sedan abandoned on a highway Sunday morning.\nIn the car, law enforcement found a cowboy hat Boelter had been seen wearing in surveillance footage as well as a letter written to the FBI, authorities said. The letter said it was written by \"Dr. Vance Luther Boulter\" and said he was \"the shooter at large in Minnesota involved in the two shootings.\"\nThe car was found in rural Sibley County, where Boelter lived, and a police officer reported that he believed he saw Boelter running into the woods. Police called in 20 different tactical teams, divvying up the area to search.\nDuring the search, police said they confirmed someone was in the woods and searched for hours, using a helicopter and officers on foot, until they found Boelter. He gave himself up to police, crawling out to officers before he was handcuffed and taken into custody in a field, authorities said.\nJail records show Boelter was booked into the Hennepin County Jail early Monday.\nCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices·About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications·Submit a news tip·Report error\nRelated Stories\nMan suspected of shooting 2 Minnesota lawmakers is in custody after surrendering to police\nPolice in Minnesota searching for suspect in 'politically motivated assassination'\nPrescott, Ont., man pleads guilty to uttering death threat aimed at Conservative MP\nWoman charged with 1st-degree murder in death of missing Winnipegger\nMurder charge stayed against 1 of 3 men accused in fatal shooting of Winnipeg soccer player\nFooter Links\nMy Account\nProfile\nCBC Gem\nNewsletters\nAbout CBC Accounts\nConnect with CBC\nFacebook\nX\nYouTube\nInstagram\nMobile\nRSS\nPodcasts\nContact CBC\nSubmit Feedback\nHelp Centre\nAudience Relations, CBC\nP.O.
