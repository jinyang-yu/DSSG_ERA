(Submitted)\nSocial Sharing\nWildfires have burned through much of northern Saskatchewan, forcing thousands from their homes and leaving many business owners who rely on local tourism in limbo.\nLow on power or data? Use CBC Lite for the latest on wildfires\nWhile some have been left with nothing, even those whose businesses survived are left with uncertainty about what's next.\n\"We were in our first week of summer operations for this season when the evacuation order came,\" said Cindy Ouellet, who owns the T&D Amisk camp — about 30 kilometres from Denare Beach — alongside her husband Nick.\nShe said they had to evacuate guests out of the camp on May 28, then go through and cancel bookings up to July 5 \"week-by-week.\"\nOuellet said the aftermath of the wildfires has been \"devastating\" for her business.\n\"Our season runs from the last week of May to typically the 1st of October,\" she said. \"We do some small business operations in the winter, but that's very minimal compared to the summer months. And the month of June is our main bread and butter.\"\n'We don't know at this point how long we will continue cancellations and when we will actually be ready to welcome our guests,' said Cindy Ouellet, the owner of T&D Amisk camp. (Submitted by Cindy Ouellet)\nOuellet said she is fortunate her business is covered by a business interruption insurance policy. She had to use it once before during the pandemic, when her business was shut down for a year and a half.\nNot everyone has that option. Ouellet said she made a private Facebook group to help those who have suffered losses — many of them friends and \"fellow business owners.\"\nShe said the group is a place solely for those who need to rebuild. It will provide \"all the resources possible,\" including RTM providers, builders, contractors and insurance information.\n\"Seeing friends absolutely desperate and lost, suffering this devastation and then on top of it having to make really big decisions fairly quickly,\" Ouellet said. \"Nobody should have to do that without some sort of help.\"\nOuellet and her husband have also housed residents as they begin to return to the area and crews coming in to help rebuild.\nEarlier this month, owners of The Ridge on Amisk Resort announced it as a total loss after the Wolf fire engulfed the northern village of Denare Beach.\n\"Our life savings, dreams, our blood, sweat and tears along with our hearts and souls, in one afternoon it was all taken away,\" the post said.\nExperts say Sask. wildfires could remain ablaze until snowfall\nNeil MacAuley, the owner and operator of La Ronge Fishing Adventures, is grappling with what work could look like once the smoke settles.\nHe runs a third-generation charter operation that provides full and half-day guided fishing, and all the gear required.\nMacAuley said that as the wildfire season has gotten worse over the last couple of years, people in the community have become \"a little uneasy.\"\n\"You have your clients and your guests out there, and they're watching giant plumes of smoke billowing up, you know, 10 to 15 miles away,\" he said. \"You're trying to reassure them that you know, we're going to be OK, it's safe.\"\nNeil said many of his friends lost their cabin to the Pisew fire in La Ronge.  (Submitted by Neil MacAuley)\nMacAuley said he hopes it will be a good season for his business, but it heavily relies on the campgrounds in the area, many which have burned down.\n\"We've already had about seven or eight cancellations already. So we're going to try and fill those up, but it's going to be tough for us.\"\nHe said many of those calling to cancel have been people who have lost property in the fire.\nWhat's at the heart of Sask.'s early wildfire season? Humans, in more ways than one\nMacAuley is not the only business owner experiencing a slew of cancellations. Glen Thompson, one of the owners of Osprey Wings, an air charter company in northern Saskatchewan, said between 80 and 100 flights have been cancelled so far.\n\"That's probably in the neighborhood of a couple hundred-thousand worth of lost revenue,\" he said, adding that many businesses are \"suffering.\"\nGlen Thompson, one of the owners of  Osprey wings, said they are waiting for the air space to open up in certain places across the province to service more people.  (Submitted by Glen Thompson)\nOsprey Wings provides flights for tourism, mining, the public service sector and fire suppression. Thompson said it's run by 25 people across 994 planes, and services hundreds of businesses across areas north, east and west of La Ronge and Mississippi.\nOver the last few months, the company has been helping fire chiefs and firefighters travel around to outfitters camps and sites that needed pumps set up, Thompson said.\nAs the fire situation improves, he said the next priority is to get back to business and help the community as much as possible.\n\"Hopefully we can get things some semblance of normalcy back into our northern community,\" Thompson said.\n\"If you've ever been to northern Saskatchewan, it's just probably one of the neatest experiences you'll ever have in your lifetime.\"\nUp-to-date info on active fires, smoke and related topics is available at these sources:\nInteractive Sask. active fire map.\nFire danger map.\nFire bans.\nEnvironment and Climate Change Canada weather alerts.\nSask.

But after all, this is Formula 1 | CBC News Loaded\nEntertainment\nBrad Pitt's F1 movie is formulaic. But after all, this is Formula 1\nWhile a little clunky, there is little to nothing F1 actually does outrageously wrong. And given the heart-pounding race scenes, that's enough to make this dad movie stand out.\nRacing flick hits some clunky story-beats, while nailing its racing scenes\nJackson Weaver  · CBC News  · Posted: Jun 17, 2025 12:00 PM EDT | Last Updated: 38 minutes ago\nDamson Idris, left, appears as Joshua Pearce and Brad Pitt is Sonny Hayes in F1 The Movie. (Apple TV+)\nSocial Sharing\nWatching Brad Pitt's new racing movie, F1 The Movie, I am a bit like a Labrador at the beach.\nBecause as I try to follow the racing rules, overdone plot beats and famous faces, I am generally confused, have no idea what anyone is doing, am more than a little annoyed by the music and will probably squeeze in a few opportune moments to nap. But on the whole, I'm still excited to be here.\nDespite the many, many bumps on the road, F1 still manages to roll us across the finish line — something a bit easier perhaps for a genre whose only demand is showing things go really fast.\nFollowing itinerant, woebegone Formula 1 racing alum Sonny Hayes (Pitt), the film hits all the requirements of the genre. Hayes is a down-on-his-luck, grizzled vet with a chip on his shoulder, and when we meet him, he's skipping around the world's racing circuits as a gun-for-hire. Anyone looking for a devil-may-care driver to push them over the edge is enough to get him. What if they can't pay much? Doesn't matter. Money, Hayes assures us, isn't the point.\nSo what is the point? That's a fuzzy proposition — one that only gets fuzzier as his old racing buddy Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem) tracks him down at one of the rathole dive bars he frequents these days. Cervantes is wearing a Gucci suit, but the flash is for show — despite ruling the roost as the owner of the APX F1 racing team, he's currently $350 million in the hole.\nWATCH | F1 The Movie trailer:\nIt gets worse. Cervantes's lead driver has hit the road, his other driver is the renegade rookie Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), and if his pathetic team doesn't manage to win at least one of the nine races left in the season, the board can force Cervantes to sell.\nThis makes Hayes his best bet; or, his best bet after nine earlier options turned him down. In Hayes's favour is his erstwhile superstar status. That is, before a spectacular crash broke a couple of vertebrae and forced him into the relatively slower lanes of NASCAR and off-road racing.\nAt the same time, Hayes's clinically cavalier attitude at least gives Cervantes a shot. But this entails Hayes and Pearce getting over their egos to help one another, instead of turning their souped-up testosterone-mobiles into 300 km/h metaphors for unmanaged inadequacy complexes and chronic intimacy intolerance.\nSo in essence, Ford v. Ferrari. Or Rush. Or, perhaps most similarly, Talladega Nights.\nSonny Hayes (Pitt) reunites with old pal Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem) in F1. (Apple TV+)\nOr really, any racing movie ever made. The films are never about racing per se, but about the romantic ideals of self-destructive masculine pride and will-they-or-won't-they competitive camaraderie. This time, the through-line is something closer to Call Me By Your Name: a mentorship-slash-rivalry between Hayes and Pearce that — for the most part — gives the otherwise formulaic plot some momentum.\nWhich, to be fair, is the least interesting form of momentum on offer when judging a movie promising so much exhilarating action it advertised through a haptic trailer. This is an Imax feature using characters as an excuse for racing, and it shows — primarily, for how much those racing scenes pop.\nWith cameras mounted on the hoods, dashes, rooftops and bumpers of the most popular motorsport in the world, F1 performs best as all good racing movies do: when all the annoying storylines have been dealt with so we can get back to the track, the whole reason we and our dads bothered heading to the theatre.\nThis is good given the fact that the canned, often clunky non-racing scenes alternately drag or work against the film's theme. For example, Hayes's constant flirting with team technical director Kate McKenna (Kerry Condon) might not flesh out either of the characters, but where would we be without a romantic subplot?\nREVIEWThe Life of Chuck — for better or worse — dances to the end of the world\nREVIEWHow to Train Your Dragon: We can get one good live-action adaptation. As a treat\nThe contrived one-liners don't evoke an Ocean's 11 old-school vibe so much as draw attention to how far from classic this film is. Maybe we can excuse Bardem for unironically uttering the line, \"The board is up my ass.\" Or rejigging Talladega Nights' satirical quip \"If you're not first, you're last\" into the more self-serious \"Sometimes when you lose, you win.\"\nAnd what about when McKenna cuttingly remarks, \"They're saying Sonny Hayes isn't a has-been — he's a never-was\"? Well, that one's a bit harder to forgive.\nFor those without deep knowledge of Formula 1, what may be worse is the logic of the races themselves.\nHayes's whole schtick is fudging the arcane rules of the sport to force an advantage — a sort of Moneyball rehash for Pitt, except with fewer whiteboards. For those of us lacking the experiential understanding of how, for example, damaged wings can lead to red flags, it may be a bit hard to keep track of the how or why of it all.\nIf it weren't for the frequently yelled explanations from racing analysts describing just how Hayes has subverted the rules, it may be impossible to follow why he's so impressive at all.\nThe racing scenes in F1 the Movie are scintillating. (Apple TV+)\nOr whether he's ingeniously winning or blatantly losing when he and his partner crash into a barrier. And another barrier. And lose. And lose again. And, infuriatingly, tease the audience with more failure to the point where you wonder whether these are the same guys tailgating you on duller stretches of Highway 1.\nWhich, again, is less important than how fast the cars go. Complaining about the structure feels like a fool's errand — though it would be even more foolish not to mention how the ending seems to invalidate everything that came before. There's a bait-and-switch that takes Hayes's character arc and completely undoes it. The film uses a thousand symbols pointing out how the allure of racing glory has been destroying him, only to then twist them around to say he was always right to yearn for it.\nReviewGran Turismo doesn't quite crash and burn — but it's still barely a racing movie\nIt is the screenwriting equivalent of Fast & Furious actors' contractual requirement that they don't lose fights, in order to ensure they continue looking heroic. It is the character-growth equivalent of having their cake and eating it, too, and then eating seven more. And then opening a bakery.\nIt's a silly, counterproductive narrative failing. But really, who cares? We're here to see cars go fast. And when Pitt's behind the wheel, do they ever.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nJackson Weaver\nSenior Writer\nJackson Weaver is a reporter and film critic for CBC's entertainment news team in Toronto.

(Willy Sanjuan/Invision/The Associated Press)\nSocial Sharing\nA doctor charged with giving Matthew Perry ketamine in the months leading up to the Friends star's overdose death has agreed to plead guilty, a plea agreement filed Monday shows.\nDr. Salvador Plasencia has agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.\nFederal prosecutors said in a statement that the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. They said Plasencia is expected to formally plead guilty in the coming weeks.\nAccording to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \"moron\" who could be exploited for money. The physician had been one of the primary targets of the prosecution, along with Jasveen Sangha, a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer. Three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their co-operation.\nPlasencia and Sangha had been scheduled to face trial in August. An email to his attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.\nDoctor who helped get Matthew Perry ketamine pleads guilty\n5 charged in Matthew Perry's death, including his assistant and 2 doctors, prosecutor says\nPerry was found dead by his assistant on Oct. 28, 2023, at age 54. The medical examiner ruled that ketamine, typically used as a surgical anesthetic, was the primary cause of death.\nOff-label treatment\nThe actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression that has become increasingly common. But prosectors have said Perry soon began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.\nPlasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry's death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine, totalling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.\nQ with Tom PowerKeith Morrison opens up about his stepson Matthew Perry's life, death and legacy\nMatthew Perry died of 'acute effects' of ketamine, according to L.A. county medical examiner\nHe also admitted to enlisting the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.\n\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez's plea agreement. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between where Plasencia practised in L.A., and San Diego, where Chavez practised, and exchanged several vials of ketamine, the filings said.\nAfter selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500 US, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's \"go-to,\" prosecutors said.\nPlasencia admitted to visiting Perry's house twice and injecting him with ketamine. He also left ketamine behind and showed Perry's personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, how to inject it, according to Iwamasa's plea agreement. The doctor later met up with Iwamasa and gave him more ketamine for Perry, according to the document.\nPerry was also getting ketamine from Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major dealer and supplied the dose that killed the actor.\nSangha has pleaded not guilty — making her the only one of the five people charged in Perry's death who has not entered a plea agreement. She remains jailed as she awaits trial. Plasencia was freed on bond after his initial court appearances.\nErik Fleming, a friend of Perry who said he acted as a middleman and drug messenger, has also pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with prosecutors.\nNone of the defendants has yet been sentenced. Plasencia's plea deal makes no specific sentencing guarantees.\nPerry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on the megahit NBC sitcom Friends, when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004.\nCBC's Journalistic Standards and Practices·About CBC NewsCorrections and clarifications·Submit a news tip·Report error\nRelated Stories\n'It's a little brighter': More veterans turn to ketamine therapy for depression, PTSD\nRussell Brand pleads not guilty, with sexual assault trial scheduled for June 2026\nN.S. man who claimed religious right to the psychedelic ayahuasca pleads guilty\n'I have a life back': How ketamine therapy is helping these Nova Scotians find relief from depression\nFormer volunteer pleads guilty to sexual assault\nFooter Links\nMy Account\nProfile\nCBC Gem\nNewsletters\nAbout CBC Accounts\nConnect with CBC\nFacebook\nX\nYouTube\nInstagram\nMobile\nRSS\nPodcasts\nContact CBC\nSubmit Feedback\nHelp Centre\nAudience Relations, CBC\nP.O.
