Communication. Teamwork. Once deemed or even dismissed as “soft” skills, they’ve been rebranded as “durable” skills. As AI and automation reshape the work force and transform entire industries, employers now value durable skills more than technical skills, according to the Job Outlook 2025 report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers.\nHiring managers are looking for more than what college graduates know. They want to see how graduates think, learn, connect, adapt, and lead. It’s the human capacity for imagination, creativity, and collaboration that technology cannot replace.\nSo how can higher education ensure students develop the skills that truly endure? How can institutions produce career-ready graduates who have the resilience and agility to navigate a future where the only constant is change?\nJoin us on Wednesday, June 25, at 2 p.m. ET for a virtual forum, “Why Employers Value ‘Durable’ Skills.” Experts will discuss how higher education can develop students’ durable skills throughout their college journey — from admission to graduation.\nHost\nIan Wilhelm\nDeputy Managing Editor\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education\nExplore Content\nLatest News\nNewsletters\nLetters\nFree Reports and Guides\nProfessional Development\nVirtual Events\nChronicle Store\nChronicle Intelligence\nJobs in Higher Education\nPost a Job\nKnow The Chronicle\nAbout Us\nVision, Mission, Values\nDEI at The Chronicle\nWrite for Us\nWork at The Chronicle\nOur Reporting Process\nAdvertise With Us\nBrand Studio\nAccessibility Statement\nAccount and Access\nManage Your Account\nManage Newsletters\nIndividual Subscriptions\nGroup and Institutional Access\nSubscription & Account FAQ\nGet Support\nContact Us\nReprints & Permissions\nUser Agreement\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nCalifornia Privacy Policy\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n1255 23rd Street, N.W.

Every one of them serves Hispanic students,” lawyers said. “Every one of them serves low-income students. But not one of them qualifies to receive grants under the HSI program. Why? Because they don’t have the right mix of ethnicities on campus.”\nIn order to qualify for the HSI program, a college must serve a student body made up of at least 25 percent Hispanic students. A majority of its enrollment must also be low-income.\n“Treating people differently because of their skin color and ancestry drags our country backwards,” Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said in a statement. “The HSI program perversely deprives even needy Hispanic students of the benefits of this funding if they attend institutions that don’t meet the government’s arbitrary quota.”\nThe Details\nHSIs, a designation created in 1992, enroll half of all Latino college students, according to the Rutgers Center for Minority Serving Institutions. The number of HSIs has gradually increased as enrollment demographics have shifted. There are currently 615 federally designated HSIs, a 5-percent increase from last year.\nFunds from the federal Developing Hispanic-Serving Institutions Program have helped colleges provide scholarships and fellowships, invest in campus buildings and laboratories, and grow endowments. In 2023, the program awarded more than $28 million to HSIs around the country, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\nStudents for Fair Admissions (SFFA) is the same group of lawyers that in 2023 sued Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill over race-conscious admissions. In the HSI suit, lawyers argued that public tax dollars should not be distributed based on a colleges’ racial makeup and cited the 2023 Supreme Court ruling in their favor.\nThe lawsuit contends that several of Tennessee’s public colleges and universities — including the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, Middle Tennessee State University, East Tennessee State University, and the University of Memphis — have been excluded from the program, despite meeting “neutral eligibility criteria.” More than 60 percent of students at the University of Memphis are minorities, but the institution does not meet the threshold to be considered an HSI.\n“This lawsuit is not about denying opportunity to any racial or ethnic group. It is about ensuring that opportunity is extended to everyone on an equal basis,” Edward Bloom, president of SFFA, said in a statement.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe lawsuit could set a precedent for how federally designated Predominantly Black Institutions (PBIs) and Asian American, Native American and Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs) are funded. (PBIs are different from historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, which receive federal designation based on their founding date and original mission.)\nAcquiring a PBI status requires a student body made up of at least 40 percent Black students. The AANAPISI designation requires that students who identify as Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander make up at least 10 percent of the student body.\nMinority-serving institutions were established in 1965 after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Higher Education Act with the explicit mission to increase the number of minority students enrolled in college.\n“Because MSIs enroll a substantial share of minority students, many of whom might not otherwise attend college, the continuous development and success of these institutions is critical for realizing our nation’s higher-education and work-force goals and for the benefit of American society,” the Rutgers Center for MSIs wrote on its website.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThere are currently more than 700 federally designated MSIs in the United States. In 2023, MSIs accounted for more than a third of all full-time undergraduate students and 52 percent of students of color, according to the Rutgers Center for Minority Serving Institutions.\nThe Details\nConservative think tanks like the Manhattan Institute, the Federalist Society, and the American Civil Rights Project have argued in several white papers that MSI programs with explicit racial criteria violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n“MSI programs intentionally treat colleges and universities differently based on the races of their students (and the imputed race of the institution), which the federal government has lacked the power to do since 1954,” Dan Morenoff, executive director of the American Civil Rights Project and an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute, wrote in draft legislation to eliminate MSI funding.\nADVERTISEMENT\nColleges eager to attain the MSI designation sometimes employ explicit efforts to recruit Latino students. Morenoff said that the millions of dollars in federal funding that the programs provide entice administrators to violate civil-rights laws in recruitment practices.\nMorenoff and other conservative activists have advocated for the federal funds to instead be diverted to the Pell Grant, which is currently at risk of budget cuts, or to states directly through block grants.\n“If your concern is that there are people who do not have access to higher education, you can directly address that and you do not need a racial gloss in order to get from point A to point B,” Morenoff told The Chronicle. “There are better ways to do this that are constitutionally unproblematic.”\nHSI advocates argue that Latino students have historically been discriminated against and continue to enroll into and graduate from college at significantly lower numbers than their white counterparts.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn Tennessee, only 26 percent of Latino adults earn an associate degree or higher, compared to 48 percent of white adults, according to Excelencia in Education, a national organization focused on educational success for Latino students.\nSouthern Adventist University, Tennessee’s only HSI, received its federal designation in 2023.\nThat year, the university was awarded a $3-million grant to establish a STEM Success program for “Hispanic, low-income, and other underserved student populations.” SAU launched a scholarship program that provides Hispanic students with up to $6,000 per year if they have at least a 3.0 GPA.\n“Southern Adventist University’s DHSI grant allows the university to strengthen support services, implement institutional changes, and improve learning opportunities for all students,” a spokesperson for the university wrote in a statement to The Chronicle. “It also allows us to encourage all high-school students, with an emphasis on the underserved, to take appropriate high-school courses and then choose STEM degrees at higher-education institutions of their choice.”\nWhat to Watch For\nIt’s not yet clear how the Trump administration will respond to the lawsuit.\n“The primary goal of such litigation almost has to be to open the doors for all of our institutions to compete on an even basis, regardless of the race of their students,” Morenoff said. “How you get from here to there — whether that’s through some kind of legal change by Congress, whether that’s by court order — remains to be seen.”\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

Harris, president of Grinnell College, which is facing a potential 21-percent tax, she said. “We don’t have a D-I athletic team. We don’t have a medical center. We don’t have billions of dollars of grants.”\nThe proposed endowment tax builds off of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which instituted a 1.4-percent tax on net investment returns on private nonprofit colleges that enrolled over 500 students and had endowments of over $500,000 per student.\nThe new bill would sort colleges into a four-tiered system according to a “student-adjusted endowment” — calculated by dividing endowment assets by the number of domestic students. Those with a student-adjusted endowment above $2 million would pay 21 percent. That rate drops to 14 percent for colleges with a ratio of $1.25 million to $2 million, 7 percent for colleges at $750,000 to $1.25 million, and 1.4 percent for colleges at $500,000 to $750,000.\nThe calculation excludes international students, which would place into these tiers institutions like Columbia University and the University of Pennsylvania, which have been in the Trump administration’s crosshairs. Columbia stands to pay a 1.4-percent tax, while Penn is estimated to pay a 7-percent tax, according to The Chronicle’s projections.\nWhile the proposed policy would affect a very narrow slice of the nation’s very selective institutions, leaders of such colleges argue that the bill may end up working against other stated objectives of Congress, like improving access to and the affordability of their institutions. Of the 31 colleges, excluding medical schools, that would potentially fall into the top three tax tiers, 14 are small liberal-arts colleges, according to The Chronicle’s analysis, which is based on endowment returns for fiscal year 2023. Depending on their endowments’ performance in the next fiscal year, some colleges could be propelled into higher or lower tiers, and more colleges could be added to the list.\nWhat Will Trump’s Presidency Mean For Higher Ed?\nKeep up to date on the latest news and information, and contact our journalists covering this ongoing story.\nLeaders of many of these small colleges say that if they are forced to reallocate millions more dollars in endowment returns to the U.S. Treasury, that would mean less money available for their basic operations, financial aid, need-blind admissions policies, and community-facing programs — areas that they say benefit students, by making college more affordable, and the wider community, by putting money into local programs and institutions.\nEndowment revenues contributed to 49 percent of Pomona College’s annual operating budget. And 60 percent of Grinnell’s operating budget comes from endowment revenues. At Swarthmore College, 57.6 percent of its 2024-25 revenues came from endowment spending.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“So it’s a pretty simple story,” said Rob Goldberg, vice president for finance and administration at Swarthmore. “A tax that gets at the guts of your revenue is going to be pretty impactful.”\nA Blow to Financial Aid\nFor many small colleges, the impact of an increased endowment tax will be felt most heavily in its ability to provide institutional aid.\nThese institutions spend the majority of their endowment returns on their financial-aid programs, putting them above the national average of 48.1 percent, according to a 2024 survey of 645 college respondents by the National Association of College and University Business Officers.\nThe thing that we’re the most worried about is if the Congress wants to limit student debt and reliance on federal loans, this could have the opposite effect of that.\nAt Pomona, 60 percent of the financial-aid budget comes from its endowment, according to Robert Gaines, its acting president. This money helps Pomona maintain its need-blind admissions policy and commitment to meeting admitted students’ full demonstrated need. If the tax were to pass, these policies “would be severely compromised,” he said.\nOver half of Swarthmore’s student body receives financial aid, with an average award of $72,000. The total cost of attendance for the 2024-25 academic year was $88,696, according to federal data.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“If we had to absorb an endowment tax of this magnitude, we have to revisit that program,” Goldberg said. “I just don’t think there’s any other way around it.”\nAt Smith College, about two-thirds of the student body receives financial aid, which is largely financed through endowment interest. David DeSwert, executive vice president for finance and administration, wrote in a statement to The Chronicle that the college is “extremely concerned” about possible effects on accessibility for the low-income students it enrolls. Eighteen percent of its students receive Pell Grants, according to federal data.\nEleven of the 14 small liberal-arts colleges that could find themselves in the top three tax tiers practice need-blind admissions for domestic students, meaning that applicants are admitted without considering their ability to pay tuition. These 11 colleges also seek to meet students’ full demonstrated need. Nine of those colleges also commit to a no-loans aid program.\nBryn Mawr College, which, along with Smith and McPherson Colleges, doesn’t practice need-blind admissions, has worked to flatten or decrease the cost of attendance for low- and middle-income families over the past five years. A potential 7-percent tax on endowment earnings would not only hinder those efforts but have “the potential to impact nearly every aspect of the operations at every college it applies to,” Wendy Cadge, Bryn Mawr’s president, wrote in a statement to The Chronicle.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLarge research universities are also steeling themselves against negative impacts to their financial-aid programs. For example, Princeton University, which would be among those taxed at the 21-percent level, relies heavily on endowment returns, which make up 55 percent of its nearly $3-billion annual operating budget. Over half of its annual endowment spending goes toward financial aid.\nFor Washington and Lee University, in Virginia, which currently pays the 1.4-percent tax rate and would face an increase to 7 percent, a tax hike would be equivalent to 200 scholarships, according to Will Dudley, the institution’s president.\nThe increased tax would affect Wellesley College on several fronts, according to Stacey Schmeidel, the college’s spokesperson. Endowment returns make up the largest portion of its operating budget, at 43 percent. That money helps support its financial-aid program, which supports 55 percent of the student body. If the college were to pay a 14-percent tax, or an approximately $30-million tax liability each year, that would be equal to fully funding 325 students. About one in five students at Wellesley receive Pell Grants.\n“Essentially, it is a tax on the students who most need aid,” Schmeidel wrote in a statement. She also warned that increasing the endowment tax could hurt Wellesley’s ability to “hire and retain faculty.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nOther endowment-reliant small colleges are bracing for potential impacts to their basic operations. For Swarthmore, endowment funds drive the “day-to-day upkeep of our facilities,” Goldberg said. Amherst, Pomona, and Wellesley Colleges have all warned in public statements that their campuses’ operations would be hurt by an increased endowment tax.\n‘Economic Engine’\nEndowment returns can also finance projects that benefit the communities in which small colleges are located, say several of their leaders. That includes grants to local hospitals, college-subsidized public-transportation passes, and dining-plan programs that substitute meal swipes with money that can be spent at local restaurants.\nThese colleges, which tend to be in rural areas, are also often critical contributors to their local and state economies. Williams College is one of the largest employers in its town, Willamstown, Mass., with 1,322 permanent employees, whose wages “outpace the median for our area,” according to Maud S. Mandel, the college’s president.\nGoldberg described Swarthmore as “an economic engine for our local region and for the state.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor example, Swarthmore’s “dining dollar” program, which pays for student meal plans that can be used at local restaurants and stores, adds “about a million dollars a year into the village economy,” according to Goldberg. Swarthmore also gives students free public-transportation passes that subsidize and encourage students to get off campus into the Philadelphia area.\nThe tax, said Goldberg, “has second- and third-order effects that I don’t know if people really understand.”\nGrinnell taps its endowment returns to pay for efforts that benefit the wider community. It awards grants that go toward supporting the town’s priorities, including the maternity ward at the local hospital, building an accessible playground, and supporting the Grinnell Historical Museum.\nThese benefits are among the examples Grinnell is highlighting as it appeals to lawmakers to stop the legislation from continuing in its current form. Harris said that she has been in contact with Sen. Charles Grassley, a Republican of Iowa, and spoken with his tax expert.\nADVERTISEMENT\nIn her conversations with them, Harris said, she emphasized the potential impacts of an endowment tax and how they would be felt by “our incredibly diverse ecosystem in higher education.”\n“We are not all the same, right? There are research institutions, there are regional publics, there are these small liberal-arts colleges,” Harris said. “As high as the stakes are, these have been really wonderful conversations as people realize, ‘Oh OK, this is what’s going on. Like, this is your financial model.’”\nBanding Together\nThese are the types of arguments small colleges are making as they engage in a joint lobbying effort against the proposed tax.\nGoldberg, of Swarthmore, said that the more than 20 institutions in the “Small Colleges Coalition” are united by their “similar financial structures,” meaning that they share a “much higher reliance on endowments than bigger schools, and we have far less reliance on federal funding than bigger schools.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nSome of the ideas being floated include having a different tax rate for colleges that enroll fewer than 5,000 students, or giving tax breaks to colleges that report high graduation rates and low student indebtedness, according to Politico.\nThe budget bill’s endowment-tax provisions appear to be generating some skepticism in the Senate. Sen. James Lankford, a Republican of Oklahoma who serves on the Senate Committee on Finance, told Politico that he wants to dial back the endowment-tax hike, though he did not discuss specifics.\nCollege leaders are also warning that increasing the endowment tax would run headlong into a stated aim of the Republican lawmakers spearheading this legislation: making college less expensive.\nAt Swarthmore, Goldberg cautioned that “the thing that we’re the most worried about is if the Congress wants to limit student debt and reliance on federal loans, this could have the opposite effect of that.” In addition to hiking endowment taxes, the budget bill proposes limiting Pell Grant eligibility, capping some student loans, and mandating that colleges pay back portions of debt accrued by students who default on their loans.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSenate Republicans on Tuesday released their own version of a reconciliation bill that does not include the same credit-hour restrictions that are proposed in the version passed in the House.\n“It could force schools like us that are no-loan into a situation where we would have to provide less aid, and then students would have to take out loans to make up the difference and then thus graduate with higher debt,” Goldberg said. “I don’t think that’s what the Congress intends.”\nRep. Jason Smith, a Republican of Missouri and chair of the Ways and Means Committee, said in a statement that the legislation is meant to tax colleges like corporations. He alleged that wealthy colleges are “often failing to use their endowments to enhance student services, experiences, and quality of education on campus.”\nBut that’s what the leaders of this group of small colleges say they’re already doing. “We are doing what we are hearing the American public say they want small liberal-arts colleges to do: provide college access, have reliable and effective outcomes for our students, and be a public good,” said Harris, of Grinnell. “We want to be a good neighbor, and I’m trying to make the case that we are.”\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

However, the story has been updated to reflect that 60 percent of the college's operating budget comes from endowment revenues.\nTags\nFinance & Operations\nLaw & Policy\nAccess & Affordability\nShare\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nFacebook\nEmail\nAbout the Author\nSarah Huddleston\nSarah Huddleston is a reporter at The Chronicle of Higher Education.

Arnold Wells for The Chronicle\nFour years ago, Pano Kanelos left his post as president of St. John’s College, in Maryland. He wanted to start a college that stood in stark contrast to the rest of higher education, which Kanelos and the project’s wealthy backers felt was veering dangerously toward illiberalism. That bold experiment, the University of Austin, is finishing up its first academic year this week.\nTo continue reading for FREE, please sign in.\nSign In\nOr subscribe now to read with unlimited access for as low as $10/month.\nDon’t have an account?

He wanted to start a college that stood in stark contrast to the rest of higher education, which Kanelos and the project’s wealthy backers felt was veering dangerously toward illiberalism. That bold experiment, the University of Austin, is finishing up its first academic year this week.\nThe private, start-up college currently has 92 students, 30 faculty members, and 41 staff members. It does not receive federal funding and says it uses a “merit-first” approach to admissions. It’s trying to earn accreditation, a process the university expects to complete between 2028 and 2031. Kanelos will step down Wednesday as president to become chancellor. Carlos Carvalho, a professor of statistics in the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin, will take over the presidency.\nThe college has styled itself as opposed to ideological orthodoxy, a mission that has drawn praise in some circles. But it has also drawn criticism, with some observers arguing the institution is not as tolerant as it claims to be.\nIn an interview with The Chronicle, Kanelos shared his vision for the years to come and responded to a former staff member who recently argued that the institution had betrayed its founding principles. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nThe University of Austin captured considerable media attention during its first academic year. 60 Minutes produced a feature and students have sat for interviews with The Wall Street Journal and Fox News. But is there a moment from this past academic year that wasn’t captured by national media that made you proud of the university you helped build?\nIn February, I think, I got an invitation from some of the students to a winter ball that they were organizing. It said black tie. They were having it at this historic hotel nearby called The Driskill. I thought I should go, but I had very low expectations. I thought there’d be a bowl of punch and some cookies, and we’d hang out. I walk into this event and the young women are wearing ball gowns and the men all have tuxedos on. They brought all these guests from other places in. There’s a four-piece string quartet playing, and there’s an ice sculpture. They have this fabulous dinner, and then we all proceed into this room and there’s ballroom dancing. It was the most elegant and fun event I had been to in years. It said something about the spirit of this particular group of young people. It speaks to a larger culture that the students have created here — the taking into their own hands the formation of university culture.\nOne reason why UATX was founded was because of your dissatisfaction with the culture of other universities. When you announced the university back in 2021, you wrote in The Free Press that higher education might be “the most fractured institution of all.” Universities are cultures largely shaped by their people, who can bring in their vices and flaws. One reason why UATX is fascinating to me as a reporter is that it’s a university built from scratch, and that makes me wonder — how do you protect a clean slate from the ills that you think have plagued other institutions?\nWhat we’re all bringing is our incompleteness, our brokenness — the things that we don’t do as well as we’d like to, alongside the things that we do really well. One of the things that’s really helped us cultivate a real culture of openness, open inquiry, and truth-seeking is the fact that we incentivize making mistakes. In the classroom, we try to push one another to say: What’s the wildest thing that you can think of? What do you think might be right or wrong? We’re drawing out of each other not our own closely guarded, deep-seated opinions, but the things that we’re processing as we’re thinking about difficult issues. When you start to do that, it becomes about the ideas. It creates a more objective way to think about dealing with the complexities of human questions and life. You laud people who are boundary breakers. You reward students and faculty for going outside their own comfort zone as opposed to penalizing them.\nOur natural state of being at universities has historically been to be a place where people can have strong opinions lightly held. The closing of the aperture for the expression of ideas is a relatively recent phenomenon. That’s why I think it’s fixable. In the past three weeks, I’ve had one Ivy League president, one Ivy League dean, and one top-20-school president reach out to me to come talk about how we foster civil discourse at University of Austin. They look at us as a grand experiment. Of course, we make mistakes too, but we course correct. Everybody’s assenting right now to the need to get back to intellectual pluralism and civil discourse. The challenge is that it’s really hard to unravel at existing institutions the pathologies of how they got there in the first place. It’s much easier to do that at a start-up institution.\nA few weeks ago, a UATX staff member named Ellie Avishai published an essay in Quillette with the headline “Is the University of Austin betraying its founding principles?” She alleges that the university cut ties with the center she directed, the Mill Institute, because of a LinkedIn post she made sharing an article about diversity, equity, and inclusion. She wrote in her post: “We can have criticisms of DEI without wanting to tear down the whole concept of diversity and inclusion.” UATX does not endorse diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and practices. Is Avishai’s post the reason the university ended its partnership with the Mill Institute?\nADVERTISEMENT\nNo. The decision to [cut ties with] the Mill Institute was made well in advance of that, and we shared that with Quillette. We showed them our board had made a decision. It was in our strategic plan that we were going to discontinue the Mill Institute primarily because every one of our institutes has to be self funding. If they’re not raising enough money to perpetuate what they’re doing, then our constitution says that we shut them down. The funding trend wasn’t working for the Mill Institute. The decision was made well in advance.\n[After this interview, the university sent The Chronicle its strategic plan, which does not mention the Mill Institute. “The Mill Institute is not included in the plan because it was decided that we would not continue to support it — it wouldn’t make much sense to include the things that you are not going to pursue in a strategic plan,” Kanelos wrote to The Chronicle in a follow-up email.]\nEllie Avishai is a remote employee who’s rarely been on our campus and doesn’t really understand the culture. Her impression of what’s going on, if you match that up against Boris Fishman’s article [in The Free Press], you’ll see that it’s inaccurate. I don’t mean to say she was malicious or anything like that, but I’m just saying it’s not really accurate.\n[The Chronicle reached out to Avishai for a response to Kanelos’s remarks. She wrote in an email: “As one of the early hires at UATX, I’ve been privy to dozens of conversations with UATX leadership both in person and remotely for almost three years and have observed (and spoken with many others) about the way the culture has changed. I also participated in weekly leadership meetings with Pano and his top team for more than a year. Moreover, since the Mill Institute had not yet come close to spending down the generous gifts already donated to support it, the notion that this was largely a financial concern is questionable at best. I stand by everything I wrote in my article and sincerely wish the university well in pursuing its founding mission.”]\nADVERTISEMENT\nAvishai writes in the essay that an unnamed colleague shared with her that a major funder was upset over her post. Did a donor threaten to pull money because of the opinion Avishai expressed online?\nThat is categorically untrue. We would never allow a donor to influence anything that we’re doing at the university, academic or otherwise.\nOne of the core tenets of institutional neutrality, which UATX endorses, is that a university should host critics but not be the critic itself. A few of UATX’s leaders are openly critical of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and practices. Two of the university’s founders, Joe Lonsdale and Niall Ferguson, are featured in a video posted on the university’s X account with the caption “DEI, ESG, and BS are out.” Do these remarks from university leaders betray institutional neutrality?\nWhere universities have a responsibility to speak on potential contemporary issues is where they intersect with the operations of the university. We believe very strongly that the tenets of DEI actually interfere with the core function of a liberal, open university community. We want to be very clear that we think that applying DEI to a university community is a category error and that it will disrupt the functioning. As an institution, we don’t speak out on political issues unless they directly impact a university. What other people who are affiliated with the university say or don’t say — that’s a part of the chorus of voices that are out there in the public. I can’t control someone and tell them not to say something or do something. If it’s not coming from the university itself, I think we’re still abiding by institutional neutrality.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhen high-profile people affiliated with the university take a public stance on an issue, is that toeing the line?\nThe university is clear when we’re speaking in the university’s voice, and the university doesn’t speak for other members of the community. They speak for themselves. The one person whose voice is unequivocally coterminous with the university is the president. The president has to be even more disciplined about what is said in public because that’s really where confusion comes from. If you go to any university, the boards of trustees at Harvard or Hopkins, they’re all saying different things online and making public statements. That’s their prerogative. They’re speaking for themselves.\nThe University of Austin’s social media accounts have a spunk to it that’s not seen at other colleges. For example, this post on X roasts the University of Austin’s neighbor, the University of Texas at Austin:\nHigh school seniors,\nIf these college courses sound interesting to you...\n• “Latinx Sexualities”\n• “Queer Television”\n• “Chicana Feminisms”\n• “Black Queer Art Worlds”\n• “Queering Black Religions”\n...there’s a really good option for you across town.\nWhen the university’s account pokes fun at these topics, do you think that has the potential to stifle speech about those issues?\nADVERTISEMENT\nSometimes we want to be maybe clearer than most universities are about how those sorts of things might have a negative impact on the intellectual enterprise. Maybe we’re a little bolder to make the point. We really do believe that DEI initiatives stifle speech, compromise intellectual pluralism, and really undercut the core mission of the university. We feel that we should say that, but I’m not going to make a comment about what’s happening in Ukraine, right? Or about legislation out of D.C. that has nothing to do with universities — that’s not our business.\nI’m also interested in how UATX maintains staying power. When you look to the future, what’s your fund-raising strategy? Are you confident that you’ll be able to maintain financial support through donors, without a large endowment or federal funding?\nBecause there’s been so much enthusiasm around this project and so much support, we have a really robust runway to move forward. We have substantially more funds than we need to operate the university year over year. That gives us time to go from being a small, compact institution to grow and double and double and double. And as you do that, you’re multiplying your revenue streams, and you’re creating a stable financial model. Having a stable financial model is essential to building an institution that’s independent. One of the reasons so many schools feel at times that their independence is impeded is because they’re not financially independent. When you’re an institution that is needy, when you can’t turn away funds, whether it’s from a donor or the government, if you can’t turn those things away, you’re not independent intellectually. We’re building a model that will be stable over time. We have great momentum.\nHarvard University is one example of an institution that’s feeling the pressure of having a close financial relationship with the government. A few weeks ago, Ferguson, one of UATX’s founders, gave a talk titled “Why UATX is the Anti-Harvard.” Do you agree with that statement? If so, how is UATX the anti-Harvard?\nADVERTISEMENT\nWe’re the opposite of what Harvard is now. Harvard — a stand-in for a broader swath of elite higher education — is a bastion of entrenched elite interests. Harvard is a place that is primarily concerned with the distribution of power and influence, and that’s the promise they make to students. We’re an institution that is looking for talent and merit. Where Harvard is about networks and connections, for UATX, our goal is the transformation of young people. If you think about a place like Harvard, they built an institution to kind of perpetuate generational privilege. Maybe they’re opening the doors a little wider, but that’s really what it’s about. Our students are like the mavericks, the first-generation students, the ones who think outside the box, the ones whose goal isn’t the entry-level job at Goldman Sachs, but who want to build a hydrogen engine for Formula One cars before they leave here. We think of ourselves as having built an institution to prepare the next generation of builders, creators, and innovators. (A Harvard spokesperson did not answer a message seeking a response to Kanelos’s characterization.)\nNetworking and connections is also a core part of UATX. The university’s Talent Network boasts big names in technology and entrepreneurship like Peter Thiel and Chase Koch.\nThis is a different kind of networking. The synapses that connect here are synapses of talent. The companies that are hungry to bring our students on, it’s not because the student came from somewhere or has a certain name or certain backgrounds, but it’s because this kid’s actually really super interesting and super bright. One of the challenges I’m having right now is keeping them from hiring our students away before they finish their freshman year. The demand for our students is really intense.\nYou’ve spoken about your disapproval for sprawling administrative bureaucracies at universities. The UATX careers page lists two new positions for hire: a student-success coordinator and senior vice president for advancement. Where do you draw the line on new administrative hires? How big is too big?\nADVERTISEMENT\nOne of the places you draw the line is that there’s some positions you just have to hire, according to the accreditors. You have to have somebody who assesses student success in one capacity. For us, it’s basically, Is somebody serving the core purpose? Are they in the classroom teaching a student? Are they student-facing? Are they essential? Yes, we’re hiring a VP for advancement. You can’t raise over $200 million unless somebody is leading the charge. To put that in perspective, most schools that have raised $200 million would have an advancement team of several dozen people. We have, like, three. We stay very lean. We’re running an entire university with just a few dozen people. Next year, we’re doubling our student body, but we’re not doubling the administration. Administration is basically staying the same. We might have to have one or two people. The faculty are increasing appropriately because we have more classes.\nWhen you look ahead, what’s keeping you up at night?\nThis first year has been a dream for us. It’s gone so much better than we even hoped. The students are just amazing, and the atmosphere is electric. Over the course of a couple weeks, Alex Karp from Palantir, Peter Thiel, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and Jordan Peterson showed up to hang out with the students. People are just popping in because of the interest that they have here. We’re at a very special moment in time, the first year of the new institution. So the question I have myself is: How do we continue to cultivate that maverick-pioneer culture as we go forward? How do you keep your edge? That’s something we think a lot about.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

What Now?\nTrump has turned financial support into an existential risk.\nThe Review | Opinion\nBy Brian Rosenberg June 9, 2025\nThe longest-lasting effect of the second Trump administration might be the breaking of bonds long thought to be unbreakable.\nCertainly this is true in the realm of geopolitics.

The United States will never again, or at least will not for the foreseeable future, be seen as a reliable and trustworthy partner by its purported allies. Agreements might be resigned and commitments reasserted, but a country that elected President Trump not once but twice, knowing precisely who he is, cannot be trusted not to do something similar again. Canada and Mexico, France and Germany, know now that economic and military overreliance on the United States creates an unacceptable level of risk.\nThe same realization is — or should be — beginning to dawn on the world of higher education.\nThe relationship between the federal government and colleges and universities has never been without its challenges. Most institutions would agree that increasing and shifting governmental regulation has made operations more complex and expensive. Even before the notorious “Dear Colleague” letter sent in February by the Department of Education, such letters were often less than collegial. Oversight of bad actors has been inconsistent, and funding for Pell Grants and other forms of financial aid has not come close to keeping up with inflation.\nBut at its heart, the relationship between the federal government and higher education has been beneficial to both parties and relatively stable since the middle of the 20th century. The government has been the major source of funding for research in the sciences and a lesser source in the humanities and the arts. While not every investment has borne fruit — such is the nature of research and creativity — we are healthier, safer, more globally competitive, and culturally richer as a result.\nThe scorched-earth assault on Harvard University is generating all the headlines, but it might in fact be drawing attention away from an even larger story.\nThe government has also made it relatively easy for students from around the world to study in the United States. Again, the system has not been entirely efficient or entirely fair, but for the most part it has worked well and improved the quality of higher education while enhancing the global influence and reputation of the country.\nSupport from the federal government has been so consistent and made such good sense that colleges and universities have built their budgets, infrastructure, and programming around the assumption of its permanence. Trump 2.0 has shown what happens when the government does not behave sensibly and has turned an essential lifeline into an existential risk.\nThe scorched-earth assault on Harvard University is generating all the headlines, but it might in fact be drawing attention away from an even larger story: the tectonic shift in the future activities and financial underpinnings of American higher education and the even greater risk to institutions that have neither Harvard’s resources nor Harvard’s reputation.\nResearch universities have built enormous and expensive schools, institutes, and medical centers based upon the assumption of ongoing federal funding. Eleven percent of Harvard’s revenue in fiscal 2023 came from federally sponsored research, almost the same amount as came from the tuition paid by all degree-seeking students combined. This percentage is actually small compared to that at many other R1 institutions. At MIT, the total in the same year was 48 percent, and at Duke University it was 30 percent. The reliance on federal grants is not limited to private universities — these grants make up 27 percent of revenue at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and 23 percent at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill — or even to the wealthy and highly selective. The figure was 35 percent at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and 24 percent at Montana State University. All these amounts are exclusive of federally funded financial aid.\nMost businesses would identify such a heavy reliance on a single source of funding as a major risk. That is now proving to be the case as the government cancels contracts, withdraws grants, and proposes breathtaking cuts to granting agencies. Even if universities manage to muddle through Trump’s vindictive irrationality, can they return to building budget models that assume consistently high levels of federal support? JD Vance is waiting in the wings, and who knows what new Trumps and Vances the future might bring?\nResearch universities will have limited options moving forward: scale back the amount of research conducted; diversify the sources of funding, with some drawbacks, by looking to the private sector; or make major cuts to programs in other areas. Most will employ some combination of these strategies. We are also likely to see changes to the relationship between universities and major medical centers, whose financial outlook was less than robust even before the proposed cuts to research funding and Medicaid and which might become an unsustainable drain on university financial models. Even before Trump, Harvard Medical School had operated in the red for 12 of the last 17 years.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor some institutions, the threat to restrict or cut off entirely the flow of international students poses an even graver risk. Graduate programs in the STEM disciplines rely heavily on students from outside the United States: More than 5,000 graduate students at Carnegie Mellon are international, as are more than 4,000 at Georgia Tech and more than 3,000 at Washington University in St. Louis. Given the state of science education in the United States, these students are not replaceable by American students with similar levels of preparation and interest. Put simply, without international students, both graduate education and research in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering will shrink.\nThe more immediate threat is to the bottom line of many American colleges and universities. About 1.1 million international students currently study in the United States, roughly 350,000 as undergraduates. India and China are by far the source of the largest number of students.\nWhat matters most to colleges, however, is that a large number of international undergraduates pay full tuition at a time when a growing majority of domestic students, at both public and private institutions, do not. According to a 2020 article in the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy, at public universities, “increases in the enrollment of foreign students generate substantial gains in tuition revenues … which partially offset the loss in appropriations and mitigate the need to raise in-state tuition rates or cut expenditures.” A small handful of very wealthy institutions, including Harvard, are need-blind for international applicants, but most are very much need-aware and rely on full-paying international students, mostly from China, to meet tuition-revenue goals. The reality is messy but unmistakable: International students who are willing and able to pay the full cost of attendance make it easier for colleges to enroll domestic students who are not.\nNew York University enrolled more than 14,000 students from China alone in 2023-24. How many of these were full-fee-paying undergraduates and master’s-degree students is impossible to determine, but “more than a few” seems a reasonable guess. Other universities that enroll very large numbers of international students include Northeastern University, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne, and the University of Southern California. The pattern holds even at many small liberal-arts colleges — about 20 percent of the students at Mount Holyoke College are international.\nSubtract the full-paying international students from the applicant pool and an already fragile financial structure would begin very quickly to collapse.\nThe educational benefits of enrolling international students are real. The financial benefits are also real and, for many institutions, essential. Even if the attempts by the federal government to limit the entry of international students are found to be illegal, the message will have been sent: Enter the United States at your own risk.\nA small group of the most prestigious and selective universities might be able to substitute affluent domestic students for affluent international students at the undergraduate level, though even those institutions would likely have trouble doing so for master’s-degree programs, where costs are high and return on investment can be questionable. For most colleges, such a substitution would be impossible and tuition revenue would necessarily decline. Subtract the full-paying international students from the applicant pool and an already fragile financial structure would begin very quickly to collapse.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor the ideologues driving the administration’s policies on education and immigration — Linda McMahon and Kristi Noem are not the brains behind this operation — the destructive effects of these various policies are very much the point. None of the consequences we are seeing are unintended.\nThe bottom line: If you were running a college or university, would you feel comfortable building even a five-year budget model that assumed a traditional level of federal grant support and a steady number of full-paying students from abroad? Given the “One Big Beautiful Bill” passed by the House of Representatives — it is still hard to believe that these things are being done by adults — and the proposed Trump budget, would you even feel confident in assuming current levels of support for Pell Grants and work-study?\nDevastating scientific research and systematically undermining the preeminence of American universities — like so many of the actions of the Trump administration — represents a triumph of vindictiveness and nihilism over sound public policy. But here we are, about to see how quickly and adroitly the embattled and change-resistant world of higher education can adapt to a future in which the government cannot be trusted.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

Racism.\nThe Trump administration’s assault on diversity reflects its vision of a racially tiered society.\nThe Review | Essay\nBy Richard Amesbury  June 5, 2025\nI am told on good authority that now is the time to look for common ground with critics of diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Concede overreach and avoid conflict, goes the guidance. Compromise and compliance are not complicity: Those who defend DEI and those who attack it differ over which policies best honor the idea that all are created equal, but they agree on that idea.\nHere’s the thing: I don’t buy it. The logic of the multi-pronged assault on DEI in higher education — which includes, among other elements, a Supreme Court case, a Dear Colleague letter, and purges at service-academy libraries — sees racial inequality not as something to be overcome but as the natural order of things. With such a view, there can be no compromise.\nIn 2023, the U.S. Supreme Court effectively ended the use of affirmative action in college admissions. The 6-3 majority opinion in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard held that, by considering applicants’ race, Harvard and the University of North Carolina had violated the 14th Amendment’s equal-protection clause, which bars government from discriminating on the basis of race. In the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that an applicant “must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual — not on the basis of race,” and that race-conscious admissions programs have “concluded, wrongly, that the touchstone of an individual’s identity is not challenges bested, skills built, or lessons learned but the color of their skin.” Admissions policies at Harvard and UNC did not, the majority held, comply with the equal-protection clause’s purpose of “doing away with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race.”\nMore recently, the Trump administration has sought to extend the Court’s ruling to cover an increasingly wide range of educational policies and practices. In his February 14 Dear Colleague letter, the Department of Education’s acting assistant secretary for civil rights stated: “Although SFFA addressed admissions decisions, the Supreme Court’s holding applies more broadly. At its core, the test is simple: If an educational institution treats a person of one race differently than it treats another person because of that person’s race, the educational institution violates the law.” This interpretation far outruns the majority opinion in SFFA. Nevertheless, it partakes in its spirit: Students are to be treated as “individuals” and not on the basis of race.\nThe Dear Colleague letter goes further still, warning colleges that even programs that “appear neutral on their face” are impermissible if they are “motivated by racial considerations”: “It would, for instance, be unlawful for an educational institution to eliminate standardized testing to achieve a desired racial balance or to increase racial diversity.”\nHere the target of criticism shifts from efforts to tackle racial imbalance by means of race-conscious decision-making to race-neutral efforts to achieve the same goal. It isn’t immediately clear how eliminating standardized testing might involve what the letter calls a “proxy for race,” but apparently the principle is that removing an impediment to achieving a more racially diverse student body would be impermissible if achieving a more racially diverse student body were the rationale for removing it. What the letter suggests is that efforts to achieve racial balance or to increase racial diversity are impermissible, regardless of the means employed.\nThis latter claim — that even apparently neutral means are unlawful — represents a significant departure from both the letter and the spirit of SFFA. By conflating so-called race-based decision-making (i.e., race-conscious programs) and decision-making that is “motivated by racial considerations” (i.e., aimed at correcting racial imbalances), the Dear Colleague letter rejects not simply some means of achieving the goal of racial proportionality but the goal itself.\nThe Dear Colleague letter’s repudiation of the goal of achieving “racial balance” is consistent with other moves by the Trump administration to roll back so-called DEI programs. Indeed, by making explicit the administration’s position, the letter sheds light on what otherwise might seem a bewildering cascade of abrupt changes to federal policy and practices. What unites these changes is not merely a formal conception of equality but a normative conception of racial inequality.\nIf you’re searching for the secret heart of the war on diversity, look no further than the controversial University of Pennsylvania law professor Amy Wax. The core of Wax’s view is that racial disparities within, say, the medical profession are the result not of structural impediments or systemic racism but of real differences of ability among racial groups. Here is Wax writing in the William & Mary Law Review:\nThe best explanation for current workforce imbalances is the existence of real average group differences in knowledge, skills, and abilities. These human capital disparities, and not the use of non-merit-related selection or the erection of arbitrary barriers, best explain observed employment patterns. ... The gaps by race in developed abilities, not race-based exclusion or arbitrary barriers to employment, are the principal factors behind racial imbalances on the job.\nThe idea here is that the workplace is a meritocracy. Those with the ability to succeed will thrive; those without it will be winnowed out. What explains the underrepresentation of “blacks, and to a lesser extent Hispanics” in certain skilled professions, Wax claims, is a lack of aptitude on their part. Wax calls her position “disparate impact realism”: “The harsh reality is that more capable people tend to perform better at work, and that minorities — most notably blacks and to a lesser degree Hispanics — know less and possess fewer skills, on average, than whites and Asians across a number of domains that reflect modern workplace demands.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nWax likes to represent herself as asking taboo questions. Her views on race have never been difficult to discern, but in recent years, she has made them more explicit. In an interview with Glenn Loury, Wax declares, “I am a race realist.” Race realism is generally understood as the view that race is an explanatory factor: Differences of racial character are said to explain differences of outcome across populations. For race realists, race is not a social construct with a cultural history but an objective fact about humanity. Writing in The American Conservative last year, Wax urges “serious engagement” with the claims of “hard realism,” such as “evidence from genomics and other sources that some racial differences, including in cognitive ability, are at least partly innate” and that “acknowledging innate differences is the only effective way to defeat unceasing demands to close racial gaps.”\nIf this sounds like racial pseudoscience of the sort peddled by Charles Murray, that is because it is. While plenty of sociologists would point to differences of “social capital” to explain differences in average professional attainment across groups, few would agree that these disparities are a result of an independent variable called “race.” Most geneticists similarly recognize that race is socially constructed and forcefully reject the attempt to use genetics to rank populations.\nWax’s conclusions are straightforward: Because employers should be free to hire the best qualified workers, they should not be faulted for maintaining a disproportionately white work force. Whereas federal law provides that discrimination can exist where a facially neutral policy results in unequal outcomes among different groups, a doctrine known as “disparate-impact liability,” articulated by the Supreme Court in Griggs v. Duke Power Company in 1971, Wax claims that divergent outcomes are to be expected as a result of real differences of ability among racial groups and ought not to be taken as evidence of a flawed policy.\nSomething like this conclusion — that racial disparities should be understood not as injustices to be rectified but as reflective of differences of average ability among people of different racial groups — is, I believe, the key to understanding much of today’s opposition to the values of diversity, equity, and inclusion. This opposition is not a good-faith contribution to the debate over how most effectively to bring about an equitable society. It is not the claim of the Roberts Court that a “color-blind society” — one in which racial differences do not correlate with differences of education, wealth, or health — can best be achieved by means of “color blind” methods. Rather, it is a repudiation of that very goal.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWax is not alone in seeking to end disparate-impact liability. Kimberly West-Faulcon likens the campaign to overturn Griggs to the decades-long effort to overturn Bakke, the landmark 1978 Supreme Court decision that upheld affirmative action in college admissions. For these critics, diversity within a student body at an elite university, among the professoriate, and in other skilled professions can be achieved only through heavy-handed social engineering. It represents external interference in systems properly based on merit. For a skill-based organization to attempt to mirror the distribution of groups in the society as a whole is unjust, no matter its methods, because it assumes, incorrectly, that people of all groups are equally capable. In fact — or so the thinking of race-realists goes — white and Asian people are, on average, better qualified and so should comprise a larger percentage of most selective organizations.\nThe notion that white people are being held back, and less competent people of color promoted, goes a long way to explaining not only the seething resentment that has erupted over everything now being branded as “DEI” but also the shift in focus from methods to goals. It isn’t simply that Black applicants, say, are imagined to be receiving special treatment not afforded to white applicants; it is that anything less than a racially tiered society is understood as a miscarriage of justice, an inversion of the natural order of things. If racial taxa correspond to differences of average intelligence and ability, then a diverse workplace or law-school class is ipso facto undesirable, irrespective of how the diversity was arrived at. Roberts’s view is that equal opportunity will result in an equitable society. Wax’s argument is that it will result in a racially stratified one. Roberts’s view is ahistorical and naïve. Wax’s is repellent.\nIt is not difficult to see how it is possible to slide from a purely formal view of equality like Roberts’s to a substantive conception of inequality like Wax’s. Once structural and historical explanations for inequality are discounted, or declared irrelevant, what is left? The natural response is to “blame the victim.” This is precisely what Wax, who claims that “the taboo against blaming the victim has profoundly distorted thinking about race,” advocates. Rejecting historical and structural explanations pushes one toward race realism as an account of disparities.\nThis would appear to be the path taken by the current administration. A March 27 executive order titled “Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History” asserts that “Once widely respected as a symbol of American excellence and a global icon of cultural achievement, the Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology.” As evidence, it cites an exhibit called “The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture” which, the executive order complains, “promotes the view that race is not a biological reality but a social construct, stating ‘Race is a human invention.’”\nADVERTISEMENT\nMeanwhile, acting on orders from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, military academies have removed library books by Black authors and books critical of racism. The New York Times reports that “civilian Navy officials, following orders originating from Mr. Hegseth, pulled from shelves books including one that critiqued The Bell Curve, a 1994 text that argues that Black men and women are genetically less intelligent than white people. But the academy kept The Bell Curve itself on its shelves.” Maya Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings has been removed, but “two copies of Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler are still on the shelves.”\nRacism is acceptable; “critical race theory” is not. Removing exhibits and books about racial injustice deprives students and the public of an understanding of the real reasons for racial inequities. Keeping books that promote racism and race realism provides them with a pseudo-explanation. Once historic injustices have been erased, efforts to correct them will inevitably seem unfair. Indeed, they will be called “racism.”\nWhat is replacing DEI is not a system of individual merit but a reified understanding of racial difference. A refusal to admit and tackle racial injustices has given rise to explanations of racial gaps rooted in race realism. According to this view, efforts to deal with structural racism are to be rejected not because “race blind” means will yield equitable and diverse results, but because they will naturally give rise to the appropriate racial hierarchy. When they do not, or if employed in the pursuit of equity, they are suspect. DEI is now the catch-all term of abuse for anything that might upset this supposed natural order.\nSeen in this light, the Dear Colleague letter’s example of standardized testing takes on new significance. The thought appears to be the following: If standardized tests are an impediment to diversity, it is not because they are biased, say, but — on the contrary — because they successfully sift the intellectual wheat from the chaff, resulting in a student body that is whiter and more Asian than the background population. Eliminating testing might achieve racial diversity but at the expense of quality control. If white students on average score better, eliminating testing to achieve racial balance would apparently, from the standpoint of the Department of Education, be illicitly treating scores as a proxy for race. What the letter ignores is that tests may have the effect of racial sorting due to bias or language, or because of inequities, and thus might not be a strong predictor of student success. (All of these are, of course, empirical questions.) To forbid their elimination because of its anticipated result of greater diversity, while ignoring structural explanations for why this might be the case, as the letter does, is, ironically, to treat higher scores as a proxy for whiteness, albeit with the end not of addressing an injustice but of maintaining it.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHigher education is the laboratory in which an alternative approach to racial disparities is being prepared for wider rollout. Indeed, in “Restoring Equality of Opportunity and Meritocracy,” an executive order issued on April 23, President Trump avers that “[i]t is the policy of the United States to eliminate the use of disparate-impact liability in all contexts.” Echoing Wax, the order claims that “disparate-impact liability has hindered businesses from making hiring and other employment decisions based on merit and skill, their needs, or the needs of their customers because of the specter that such a process might lead to disparate outcomes, and thus disparate-impact lawsuits.”\nAccording to a White House spokesman, disparate-impact liability “wrongly equates unequal outcomes with discrimination and actually requires discrimination to rebalance outcomes.” Invoking the prospect of so-called reverse discrimination, Trump appeals to Roberts’s dictum: “As the Supreme Court put it, ‘[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.’” The executive order directs the attorney general to “initiate appropriate action to repeal or amend the implementing regulations for Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for all agencies to the extent they contemplate disparate-impact liability.”\nAll of this is consistent with Wax’s view. “Indeed, as Charles Murray has shown in Facing Reality,” she wrote in 2023, “reverting to the original meaning of the civil rights laws, which means returning to a colorblind meritocracy, will drastically reduce and in some cases virtually eliminate the presence of some minorities, and especially blacks, in many of society’s most demanding, rewarding, and influential positions.” Is this the aim of the Trump administration? That the administration is of one mind is unlikely. What is clear is that something like race realism explains a lot that would otherwise not make much sense.\nRead other items in What Will Trump's Presidency Mean for Higher Ed? .\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

It was “like a bomb went off,” Garrett Shanley, a young reporter at the Miami Herald (and former Chronicle intern), who has followed the saga closely, told me. My son, a UM alumnus, had a more brutal reaction: “Tough break for a swell guy,” he deadpanned over text.\nOno, who could have learned from Steven Salaita that you do not give notice before the ink is dry on your contract, has contributed another scalp to Christopher F. Rufo’s growing collection. Rufo had gone on a no-holds-barred crusade against Ono’s candidacy the moment it was announced. His campaign was effective because it consisted almost exclusively of video clips and screenshots featuring — Ono. Ono reciting a land acknowledgment. Ono intoning that “systemic racism is embedded in every corner of any institution.” Ono telling us that we “must work together to dismantle the tools of oppression and white supremacy that remain prevalent and entrenched in our everyday systems.” And so on. Others on the right jumped in, including congressmen like Byron Donalds and Greg Steube, Sen. Rick Scott, and a guy who goes by “CommiesOnCampus.” It got ugly — one of them dug up Ono’s acknowledgment of his struggle with bipolar disorder and two suicide attempts as a reason to reject him.\nIn voting no, the Board of Governors achieved the rare feat of giving delight to both the right and the left. At least I imagine CommiesOnCampus hollered just as loudly as I did when the “no” votes rolled in. Though at least in my case, schadenfreude quickly gave way to that other German emotion, fremdscham, the shame you feel on behalf of another.\nIn a grueling struggle session before the Board of Governors, Ono repudiated every dearly held belief he had confessed to in the past. He no longer believed climate change was an existential threat (because apparently the science had changed over the last two years). He asserted with robotic conviction that there are two sexes and also two genders. He bragged about closing the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at Michigan (but neglected to mention that most of our DEI programs themselves survived the alleged purge). He simply did not know whether our university hospital “had ever cut off the penis of a boy or the breasts of a girl” (and yes, this was an actual question asked in precisely those terms). “Systemic racism”? Too divisive a concept, we shall not talk of it. He proudly related that he had declined to sign an op-ed vowing to fight Trump’s vandalization of higher education. Perhaps the funniest moment arrived when one of the governors pressed him on his mandate that students living in our dorms be vaccinated against Covid. Had that been the wrong decision? He could not tell; he was merely following the advice of experts. “But you are an immunologist!” responded his questioner, with incredulity. “I am just a mouse doctor,” Ono replied, “a test-tube guy.”\nHow did Ono — the sole finalist for the job, enthusiastically backed by Morteza (Mori) Hosseini, a DeSantis megadonor and Florida trustee — manage to lose a one-man race? Perhaps it’s simple: The board wanted a committed conservative and did not believe Ono when he tried to impersonate one. Perhaps they did not want to find themselves targeted by Rufo’s crowd. Perhaps it was the instinctive bipartisan contempt most of us feel for blatant pandering: Ono’s frequent assurances that he would follow orders had an abject air to them, an eagerness to humiliate himself that does not, let’s say, signal leadership. The contract he was willing to sign is itself a document of submission: It stipulates that “Dr. Ono will commit to working with Florida and Federal DOGE to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse,” that “Dr. Ono will make it a priority to fill the interim dean positions with individuals who are firmly aligned with and support the principles guiding Florida’s approach to higher education,” that “Dr. Ono will prohibit the use of any public or private funds from being spent on DEI or political or social activism.” A knife twist on paper.\nIn the end, there was something deeply sad about the spectacle of a gifted and accomplished man trying so hard to meet the litmus tests of the crowd who claims to disdain litmus tests, a man scurrying to hold all the correct views to please the people who endlessly crow about “viewpoint diversity,” a man who praises the “alignment” of Florida politics and Florida higher education, as if political alignment, known as gleichschaltung in German, were not the antithesis of academic and intellectual freedom. But the ruination of Santa Ono also teaches us that culture warriors wield more power than billionaires now, that higher education is quickly becoming as brutal a political battlefield as any congressional race, and that the borders between red-state and blue-state colleges are not as permeable as they once were. The university is no longer universal.\nUniversities are under unprecedented assault by the very people Ono was so eager to persuade of his Pauline conversion, even though he could not quite get himself to disavow the benefits of vaccination or pretend that racism is merely a thing of an unfortunate past. Wartime, however, is not the time to hedge your bets. Nobody actually wants “institutional neutrality,” least of all the far right, which demands full allegiance to its ideological goals and will spit you out if they catch even a whiff of the woke on you — and Ono came cloaked in a cloud of near-jubilant past endorsements of everything the right disdains.\nOno’s personal tragedy may well be that the right suspects he never stopped believing, and that the left suspects that he never believed in the first place. Listening to his performance before the board, it was difficult not to conclude that the man believes nothing at all, will say anything, holds no convictions. My own most conservative belief is that we need to revive the concept of honor if we want to survive the present moment. If so, the mouse doctor deserves to spend more time with his family.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

Panicked physicians are sounding the alarm over the prospect of 7.6 million Medicaid recipients losing health-care coverage.\nSuch physician advocacy, aimed at protecting patients, is not especially controversial. But other forms of advocacy are more troubling.\nOver the past decade, we’ve grown ever more concerned about dubious strains of social-justice advocacy infiltrating medicine. Following the murder of George Floyd in 2020, doctors’ pursuit of social reform coalesced, almost overnight, into a mission.\nWithin a week of Floyd’s death, for example, the Association of American Medical Colleges, which is a co-sponsor of a major accrediting body, announced that the nation’s 155 medical schools “must employ antiracist and unconscious bias training and engage in interracial dialogues.” A year later (and again in 2024), the American Medical Association released a Strategic Plan to Embed Racial Justice and Advance Health Equity that encouraged physicians to dismantle “white patriarchy and other systems of oppression.” Over two dozen medical schools issued their own similar plans.\nMedical students are now immersed in the notion that undertaking political advocacy is as important as learning gross anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology.\nAccording to Columbia University’s department of medical humanities and ethics, advocacy is “the bridge that links patient care with efforts to address social determinants of health, institutionalized prejudices, and structural dislocations faced by patients and communities.” The department sought to develop a “cadre of advocates with expertise in achieving policy change at the local, state, and national level.”\nMedical students are now immersed in the notion that undertaking political advocacy is as important as learning gross anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology. This is the wrong lesson. Their professors should lead them, instead, to ponder important questions about the impact of advocacy on patients and the profession.\nToday, doctors perform political advocacy in myriad ways. State medical boards have added a requirement for training in “antiracism” in order to be eligible for a medical license, according to the Federation of State Medical Boards. The University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) created a document titled “Anti-Racism and Race Literacy: A Primer and Toolkit for Medical Educators.”\nCertain debates have become off-limits. Consider, for instance, a 2020 incident involving Norman C. Wang, a cardiologist with the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. After publishing a peer-reviewed critique of affirmative action in a respected medical journal, Wang’s colleagues denounced him on social media for his “racist thinking” and condemned his paper as scientifically invalid and “racist.” The journal retracted his article and the school removed him as director of the electrophysiology program. (Wang sued for retaliation and discrimination, but was unsuccessful.)\nResearchers are promoting unscientific modes of thinking about group-based disparities in health access and status. The University of Minnesota’s Center for Antiracism Research for Health Equity decrees “structural racism as a fundamental cause of health inequities,” despite the fact that this is at best an arguable thesis, not a fact. (The center was shut down last month.) The Kaiser Family Foundation states that health differentials “stem from broader social and economic inequities.”\nIn what borders on compelled speech, the State University of New York’s Upstate Medical University issued a 164-page report from a diversity task force insisting that “Health care professionals must explicitly acknowledge that race and racism are at the root of [Black-white] health disparities.” Other variables influencing the course of chronic disease, prominently the patient’s health literacy and self-care, receive scant attention.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSome medical professionals have even endorsed racial reparations in health care decision-making. At one point, the CDC vaccine advisory committee proposed prioritizing the anticipated Covid vaccine by race rather than age, solely because older cohorts disproportionately comprised whites. This plan would have delayed vaccination of the elderly — the highest risk group — and, according to the CDC’s own projections, resulted in more overall deaths. Other sponsors of health equity lobbied for a rationing scheme that prioritized the assignment of ventilators to Black patients, negating customary triage procedures.\nPerhaps the most dramatic recent display of ideological intrusion into the medical sphere took place last June at the UCSF Medical Center, where keffiyeh-draped doctors gathered on the grounds to demand that their institution call for a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Hamas. Their chants of “intifada, intifada, long live intifada!” echoed into patients’ rooms.\nThese doctors were not putting patients first — if anything, they were offending and intimidating patients. They were putting their notion of social justice first.\nAs doctors, we believe that it is enough for us to demand of ourselves that we be good at taking care of patients. But for individual doctors who wish to responsibly leverage their professional standing to effect political change, we propose three guidelines. They should advocate for policies that 1) directly help patients and 2) are rooted in professional expertise, while 3) ensuring that their advocacy does not interfere with their relationships with their colleagues, students, and patients.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFirst, the reform they promote must have a high likelihood of directly improving patient health. “Dismantling white patriarchy and other systems of oppression” is not an actionable goal. Our primary job is to diagnose and treat, and to do no harm in the process. We have no expertise in redistributing power and wealth. Even seasoned policy analysts cannot readily tease out strong causal links between health and economic and social factors that lie upstream.\nIndeed, with so many variables at play, manipulating policy in the service of health may not have the intended effect — and can easily create unwanted repercussions elsewhere in the system. The costs and benefits would be almost impossible to assess ahead of time. Moreover, patients suffering today have no time to wait for fundamental societal reorganization.\nDoctors must not lose sight of the impact of advocacy on patients and students.\nWe do not deny that much of the health disadvantage suffered by minority groups is the cumulative product of legal, political, and social institutions that historically discriminated against them. But past discrimination is not necessarily a factor sustaining those problems now. We must address the discrete causes that operate today.\nSecond, physicians’ actions or their advice to policymakers should be rooted in expertise that is unique to their profession. Opining and advocating on behalf of general social issues exploits their moral authority, turns medicine into a vehicle for politics, and risks the trust of the public. Medical professionals will, of course, have their own views of the public good. They are free to take to the barricades as citizens — but not while wearing their white coats.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThird, doctors must not lose sight of the impact of advocacy on patients and students. While advocating for one’s own patients is a basic obligation of being a doctor, advocating on behalf of societal change can work against those patients, drawing time and attention away from their care.\nThe faculty must also protect medical students’ education, an imperative complicated by advocacy, which seeks change rather than knowledge. Taking strong political stands at work also risks alienating trainees and colleagues with whom faculty members must collaborate in caring for patients. Trainees who hold different political views may withhold their opinions out of concern for their career prospects.\nOur health-care system has many problems, including high costs, limited access, and plummeting trust following the Covid-19 pandemic. As America’s poor and marginalized bear these and other burdens most acutely, it is natural that some physicians will want to go beyond the day-to-day care of individual patients.\nOne meaningful action that young doctors — who are among the most left-leaning, politically active in medicine, and most apt to assume leadership roles — could take is to work in underserved areas. According to a 2020 analysis led by Adam Bonica of Stanford University, young physicians in the prior decade had been moving so “sharply to the left” and flocking so densely to urban areas — “ideological sorting,” the authors called it — that rural areas were suffering from shortages of physicians.\nADVERTISEMENT\nA new report in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that newly licensed clinicians from top-ranked medical institutions were half as likely to initially practice in socioeconomically deprived areas as graduates from other medical institutions. Specialists were also less likely to practice in deprived areas compared with primary-care clinicians.\nOur profession appears to confront a growing paradox. Young physicians trained at elite schools are least likely to care for patients in the places they are most needed and could do the most good. At the same time, they are the most apt to promote vague goals of social justice as a professional duty. In so doing, they are helping neither patients nor the profession.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

Taylor May 30, 2025\nIn April, President Trump issued an executive order directed at the higher-education accreditation process. Trump began the order by declaring: “Accreditors have not only failed in [their] responsibility to students, families, and American taxpayers, but they have also abused their enormous authority.” To support this assertion, the president invoked the existence of “low quality” institutions and the “negative return on investment” for some degrees. These problems, supported by much data and lived experience, are real. But the president quickly exposed the pretext of his concern for these issues when he declared: “Accreditors have remained improperly focused on compelling adoption of discriminatory ideology, rather than on student outcomes.” (In response, a major accreditor\nTo continue reading for FREE, please sign in.\nSign In\nOr subscribe now to read with unlimited access for as low as $10/month.\nDon’t have an account?

Trump began the order by declaring: “Accreditors have not only failed in [their] responsibility to students, families, and American taxpayers, but they have also abused their enormous authority.” To support this assertion, the president invoked the existence of “low quality” institutions and the “negative return on investment” for some degrees. These problems, supported by much data and lived experience, are real. But the president quickly exposed the pretext of his concern for these issues when he declared: “Accreditors have remained improperly focused on compelling adoption of discriminatory ideology, rather than on student outcomes.” (In response, a major accreditor announced a temporary “stay” on requirements that reference diversity efforts.)\nThe order was the latest gambit in Trump’s aggressive attacks on racial-justice initiatives throughout society. Notably, this was not the first time he trained attention on accreditation. In a 2023 campaign video, then-candidate Trump harangued: “The time has come to reclaim our once great educational institutions from the radical left.” He characterized accreditation as “our secret weapon.” The executive order is part of that promised weaponization — the politicizing of a system that is designed to be buffered from politics.\nTo illustrate the claimed abuse, Trump calls out the American Bar Association’s Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar, the primary accreditor of law schools. Trump also castigates the Liaison Committee on Medical Education, the primary accreditor of doctor of medicine programs, and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, the sole accreditor for allopathic and osteopathic medical residency and fellowship programs.\nThe president’s ire has risen from accreditation standards issued by each body directing schools to make attempts at fostering diverse learning environments. While the Liaison Committee’s medical-school standards define diversity vaguely as the inclusion of “persons from different backgrounds and with differing life experiences,” the Council’s law-school standards are more usefully explicit. They embed diversity in the context of “gender, race, and ethnicity” and place emphasis on “racial and ethnic minorities.” The graduate medical-education standards plow a mushy middle ground, referencing “individuals underrepresented in medicine and medical leadership.”\nWhile Trump drapes the executive order in legitimate concerns about the costs and value of higher education, he picks the wrong exemplars.\nThe order’s lumping of these accreditors together in what has become a trademark shaming and intimidation ritual is telling. For starters, the standards in question are not synonymous. As explained above, each set is substantively different from the others. The law-school standards are the only ones that even invoke notions of racial justice. And while Trump drapes the executive order in legitimate concerns about the costs and value of higher education, he picks the wrong exemplars.\nOne would be hard pressed to make a reasonable argument that a medical degree is a bad or exploitative investment. Legal education is a more common target of this charge, but barring roughly five years following the Great Recession, the law degree has been a reliable path to stable employment and decent pay. Data for the graduating class of 2023 showed record highs in employment rate (93 percent), median salary ($90,000), and the percentage of new graduates securing employment prior to graduation (74 percent). Both degrees are expensive, with graduates typically leaving school with debt well over $100,000. These debt levels impose hardships on some; but the order fails to make any coherent connection between diversity-focused accreditation standards and excessive debt — or any other ills facing higher education.\nPresidential scrutiny of accreditors is not a new phenomenon. The Council’s federal recognition as a law-school accreditor seemed in peril at a June 2016 meeting of the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI). NACIQI is charged with advising the secretary of education regarding whether specific accrediting agencies should be recognized by the federal government. A five-year renewal of the Council’s recognition was on the docket.\nThe meeting opened with Ted Mitchell, then-under secretary of education, discussing the need for some accrediting agencies to “up their game.” Mitchell asserted that the “only way to ensure that the system works” is to focus on institutional outcomes. Mitchell was parroting a central Obama administration policy priority. Outcomes were a predominant focus of the administration across the education ecosystem, from early childhood through higher education. A few years earlier, the Department of Education released its College Scorecard, which was championed as “part of President Obama’s continued efforts to hold colleges accountable for cost, value, and quality.”\nAt the NACIQI meeting, Council leadership was questioned regarding its seeming reluctance to tie law-school accreditation to outcomes. Legal education was working its way through an intense period of difficulty. Employment rates and salaries for new graduates had fallen to levels unseen in more than a decade. There were simply too many graduates for the post-recession job market to absorb. The Council was broadly blamed for encouraging the glut through purportedly lax oversight. In the end, the Council’s accrediting authority was renewed, but the pressure brought by federal officials and others led the Council to adopt new standards aimed at shoring up lapses. One of the new standards added nuance and transparency to the graduate-employment data reported and published by schools; another set a more tangible institutional bar-passage requirement. Accreditor oversight was not weaponized against law schools; it was used to better protect students.\nWhen thinking about the accrediting system, one should not overstate the power of the federal government to impose its will. The influence of accreditors is enhanced by federal recognition, but it does not flow from that recognition. The process of institutional self-study and external peer review that we now call accreditation existed long before the federal government began deputizing accreditors. Law and medicine are both self-regulating guilds. Accreditation in those contexts is premised on members of the profession dictating the form, function, and substance of requisite training.\nADVERTISEMENT\nMuch is made of the existential role accreditors play in influencing which institutions are eligible to collect federal financial aid from students. The executive order calls accreditors “gatekeepers” of the nation’s financial-aid system. But this characterization has only tangential application to the agencies the order cites. As programmatic accreditors, the Council and the Liaison Committee do not typically determine a school’s financial-aid eligibility. Law and medical schools must generally secure regional or national accreditation, typically as part of their universities, to gain access to financial-aid funds.\nWhen thinking about the accrediting system, one should not overstate the power of the federal government to impose its will.\nThe influence of law- and medical-school accreditors stems from their broad acceptance as the organizational embodiments of their guilds. This acceptance has been hardened over more than a century of cultivating interest alignment between schools, consumers (potential and actual students), and state-level regulators. The founding of the American Medical Association in 1847 was motivated by concern among elites about the explosion of people practicing medicine and the proliferation of low-resource medical schools. AMA leadership pushed for stricter requirements of medical-school admission, a longer period of prescribed study, and a licensing exam. These reforms eventually became the model for medical education and licensing in the United States through an intensifying feedback loop of schools adopting the stricter admission and curricular model, consumers seeking out such schools, and regulators aligning licensing requirements to the new model.\nBy the early 20th century, the AMA, with no formal authority, came to possess the type of existential power that is often associated with accreditors today. In 1905, the AMA developed a school rating system, the distribution of which was said to cause “a great wave of improvement in medical education.” Between 1905 and 1927, the number of medical schools declined by half, with the number of schools receiving the AMA’s least favorable ratings falling by almost 90 percent. Some of them improved to higher ratings, but many shut down.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe AMA had accumulated power over institutional life and death. Its methods became the basis of the contemporary system of professional-school accreditation, with the Liaison Committee being a direct outgrowth. The Council’s law-school oversight followed a similar evolution. Federal recognition decades later was not a cause of their prominence — it was an effect. And therefore the threat of rescinding the federal recognition of these professional school accreditors is more menacing than the likely impacts of such action.\nLurking in two prominent states, however, is a real threat. The supreme courts of Florida and Texas are reconsidering their rules limiting bar admission only to graduates of law schools approved by the ABA Council. The Florida court cited “reasonable questions” about the Council’s diversity-accreditation standard as well as the larger ABA’s “active political engagement.” The Texas court was demure regarding its motivations, but the general sense is that it shares common mind with Florida.\nThe Council’s conception of a sound legal education is by no means sacrosanct — its wisdom is regularly and rightly questioned. Moreover, periodic review of bar-admission requirements should be standard practice everywhere. But when such reviews are weaponized for political aims, as these appear to be, the primary losers are law students and graduates. Currently, all jurisdictions recognize Council accreditation for purposes of bar admission; 46 limit admission only to graduates of Council-approved schools. A decision by a jurisdiction to rescind Council recognition would do immense disservice to students and graduates. No longer would their law degree be recognized nationwide, limiting its mobility and negatively impacting its value and return on investment.

But this truism applies in a special sense to the Renaissance, an era whose intellectuals developed a new orientation to history, before becoming the whetstone on which one generation of historians after another honed their ideas. It is this double story that Ada Palmer tells in Inventing the Renaissance: The Myth of a Golden Age, a quirky, meandering, and cumulatively brilliant popular history of the Florentine Renaissance and its many interpreters.\nPalmer, an associate professor of history at the University of Chicago, is well-suited to the task. Her first book, Reading Lucretius in the Renaissance (2014), was a study of the Renaissance reception of the Epicurean philosopher and poet. Ambitious in its questions and meticulous in its answers, Palmer’s research stretched back to antiquity and, implicitly, forward to the secularized, disenchanted world of the Enlightenment. But Palmer is not just a scholar. She is also a science-fiction novelist — her Terra Ignota novels have a devoted following — and a popular blogger. That is to say, she is a writer who ranges easily across millennia and media, at home in scholarly, imaginative, and breezily conversational modes. Inventing the Renaissance is a book that loops backward and forward in time and flits between an astonishing variety of topics, interspersing jokes, personal anecdotes, and silly catchphrases. Palmer aspires to depict a “weirder and more plural Renaissance” than the one most readers will have encountered; she has certainly written a weirder and more plural book than most. Yet for all its playfulness, it is ultimately a serious inquiry into the nature of historical agency — that of the Renaissance, but also our own.\nThe story begins with Petrarch. Born in exile in 14th-century Florence, watching his friends die from plague and one regime topple after another, the great poet was convinced that dark ages had succeeded the fall of Rome. There was the classical world, shining like a beacon from the distance of a millennium, and there was everything in between, up to and including the dismal present. But Petrarch was sure that a better world, more virtuous in its morals and more elegant in its grammar, was possible. “Raise the next generations on studia humanitatis,” as Palmer puts it, “and we can rear a crop of Ciceros.” The philologists and philosophers, artists and politicians, who followed him agreed. By the time the architect and art historian Giorgio Vasari wrote The Lives of the Artists two centuries later, Florence’s culture industry was riding a wave of self-confidence. Vasari declared that the painter Giotto, a generation younger than Petrarch, had touched off a rebirth, or rinascita, of the skill and vitality of antiquity. Over the course of the next century, a handful of European intellectuals, including Jean Bodin, Francis Bacon, and René Descartes, began to make an even bolder claim. The moderns had not only matched the ancients but surpassed them. Gradually, history began to have a turning point.\nPalmer is a writer who ranges easily across millennia and media, at home in scholarly, imaginative, and breezily conversational modes.\nIt was not until the 19th century, however, that the Renaissance became the name of an historical era, rather than a claim about artistic revival. In the wake of two great revolutions — French and Industrial — vast chasms seemed to open between the past and present. The origins of modernity became a puzzle; the “Renaissance” was a potential solution. The first to use the term as a period designation was the French historian Jules Michelet, but it was through the writing of the Berlin-trained Swiss scholar Jacob Burckhardt that it really caught on. In The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy (1860) Burckhardt depicted a traditional world splintering into its constituent atoms. In the Middle Ages, he claimed, people slept under a “veil of faith, illusion, and childish prepossession,” but in Renaissance Italy, the veil “melted into air.” Shaking off their credulity, the men of the Renaissance began to see the world objectively, becoming free, self-fashioning individuals. For better or worse — ultimately, in the conservative Burckhardt’s view, for worse — it was a fatal step on the path to the present.\nBurckhardt’s search for the origins of modernity transformed the study of history. Generations of German historians followed in his footsteps, seeking the key to their own society in the streets of 15th-century Florence. Then, with the rise of the Nazis, this individualistic and thoroughly cosmopolitan field was swept away. In an academic translatio imperii, the spirit of Renaissance scholarship fled to the New World. Two of the great German scholars of the Italian Renaissance, Hans Baron and Paul Oskar Kristeller, both Jewish, landed respectively at the Newberry Library, in Chicago, and at Columbia University. They would cast long shadows on American, and global, Renaissance scholarship. Among other things, they shaped Palmer’s career. Kristeller was the academic adviser of James Hankins, Palmer’s own academic adviser, making him her “academic grandfather,” as she observes; her research has carried on her mentors’ tradition of innovative intellectual history.\nIn the century that followed, new groups of scholars began to study the Renaissance, approaching it from many different angles. The history of women, history from below, and anticolonial and global history, among others, gave rise to new understandings of the era. It emerged as a period that was darker and more fraught, but also richer and more complex, than the 19th century had imagined. Yet even as interpretations and evaluations of the Renaissance changed, it remained a testing ground for theories of modernity. To explain the cultural movement that touched off in 14th-century Italy was still to explain the present, if only as the opening phase of an extended nightmare. Did the secret of historical change lie in culture, politics, economics, intellectual history, or demography? What, in Palmer’s phrase, was the “X-factor” that triggered the Renaissance, and with it, the modern world?\nIt was not until the 19th century that the Renaissance became the name of an historical era. The origins of modernity became a puzzle; the “Renaissance” was a potential solution.\nIt should be no surprise that Palmer does not give a straightforward answer. For her, as for virtually all historians today, historical interpretation is endless and plural. “Like sculpture,” she writes, “history does not have one right view.” The Renaissance she describes has many sources, converging slowly over the course of centuries. Such ecumenicalism is thoroughly conventional and, as far as it goes, convincing. But Inventing the Renaissance would be a less interesting book if Palmer did not, ultimately, have a view of historical change. She finds its essential impetus in human beings. There are “Great Forces,” which “make some historical moments ripe for change.” But there are also people, and “individuals have real agency.” The thoughts, desires, and plans of men and women give shape to history.\nThe middle section of the book, at 287 pages by far its longest, gives us 15 capsule biographies of Renaissance men and women. Some of her subjects are famous, such as Savonarola and Michelangelo, while others will be known only to specialists, such as the Florentine woodworker Manetto Amantini. As Palmer narrates these complicated, tragicomic lives, her skill as a novelist is on full display. Readers are shown the same events from different perspectives, with each repetition adding a new dimension. Pope Sixtus IV’s botched plan to have Lorenzo and Giuliano de Medici assassinated during mass, for instance, is told first in relation to the reluctant hit man Montesecco, and again in the life of the humanist Angelo Poliziano, “a physically tiny man but not too tiny to help,” who “jumped between Lorenzo and the assassins’ blades.” A compelling revisionist account of the life of Lucrezia Borgia, caricatured after her death as the ultimate femme fatale, is written in the second person. “You were hiding in a country villa when your brother-in-law Cardinal Ippolito broke the news,” Palmer writes; “your father was dead.” It is a gimmick, but it works: Placed in Lucrezia’s position, the reader becomes her proxy, navigating her choices. Biography is transformed into a role-playing game (Palmer is an avid gamer). Taken separately, each life allows the reader to see how an idiosyncratic human being acted in a difficult, dangerous environment. Read together, they reveal something more. They show how the consequences of actions extend outward, ricocheting against those of others, until the whole set of starting conditions has changed.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAmidst this crowd of Florentines, one figure receives special attention: Niccolò Machiavelli. Inventing the Renaissance begins with him and returns to him repeatedly; in total, nearly 100 pages discuss his life and thought. Unlike the book’s other men and women, Machiavelli was not merely an actor in this milieu but its greatest theorist. Up to a point, to understand him is to understand the Renaissance. But understanding Machiavelli has never been easy. Philosophers as different as Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Carl Schmitt, and Antonio Gramsci all claimed him as a predecessor, but each seemed to embrace a different Machiavelli. To Rousseau, he was a republican; to Schmitt, a realist; to Gramsci, a guide for revolutionaries. All agreed, however, that his searching investigations of human agency had launched a new epoch in political thought.\nPalmer’s Machiavelli is an equally decisive, if somewhat tamer, thinker. He is a utilitarian avant la lettre, the first to express, with crystal clarity, the idea “that ethics should consider consequences, and that studying history can help us understand the causes of past tragedies and triumphs.” In evaluating actions in terms of their human consequences, he helped to formulate a new attitude toward social life, later taken up by figures such as Francis Bacon, Denis Diderot, and many others. By slow, imperfect steps, it would make our own world, and our own ideals, possible.\nThis is what the Renaissance is for Palmer: an aspiration. Amidst constant danger and intrigue, the unremitting suffering of disease and premature death, and profound political instability, men and women dreamed of improving their lot on earth. “But if the Renaissance was so desperate and so terrible,” Palmer writes, “why did it get etched into our history as a golden age? Answer: Because they tried to make it one.” The methods they took were often strange, and their success was, to put it mildly, uneven. But the very attempt pointed to the emergence of the idea that conscious, human agency might come to shape history. Past, present, and future became newly defined as phases in an evolving history that humankind could create. Renaissance writers reassessed their history, inventing terms like the Dark Ages — to the eternal chagrin of medievalists — because they were beginning to think about their future differently.\nPalmer’s Renaissance is not the mythical Golden Age of Uffizi tour guides or high-school textbooks, nor is it the sharp and total break with a slumbering Middle Ages described by Burckhardt. Yet her Renaissance is ultimately entirely continuous with its historiographic origins. In contrast to the more neutral quattrocento or cinquecento, the Renaissance has always been a turning point defined by its artists, intellectuals, and inventors, and by analogy, by the human attempt to fashion ourselves and our world.\nThis is what the Renaissance is for Palmer: an aspiration.\nToday scholars in my own field, English literature of the 16th and 17th centuries, still meet each year under the auspices of the Renaissance Society of America, a scholarly body founded by Palmer’s academic grandfather, Paul Oskar Kristeller. But a glance at Google Ngram shows that we no longer use the word “Renaissance” to refer to the age of Shakespeare; around the turn of the millennium, we decisively switched to “early modernity.” The France and Spain of Rabelais and Cervantes are also, increasingly, “early modern,” rather than “Renaissance” or “Golden Age.” In “early modern,” the idea of a break with the Middle Ages remains, alongside the notion of historical directionality. We still turn to this particular period to explain how we arrived at the present. But where “Renaissance” evokes the human event of a birth, “early modernity” implies only the irresistible movement of time.\nDoes the turn away from the Renaissance as a historiographic concept, outside Italy, reflect the end of our belief in our own, collective ability to shape history? And if so, are we justified in our pessimism? Palmer does not think so. Despite her clear-eyed recognition of the horrors of the last half a millennium, and her acknowledgment of the crises we face in a tempestuous present, she is confident that progress is not only possible, but probable. Slowly and unevenly, with many setbacks and disasters along the way, we will consciously create a better world. I hope she is right, but I am not so sure. Our current condition more often seems to evoke that other German myth of modernity, the shadow image of Burckhardt’s Renaissance: the tale of Faust, unable to control the demons he has summoned. One thing, however, is certain. Any step forward will require a renewed sense of the collective agency first dreamed of in the Renaissance. Our history, in every sense of the word, depends on it.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

As colleges make changes in response to anti-DEI legislation and mounting political pressure, an inconsistent and confusing landscape has emerged. The pace of change ramped up in 2025, as the Trump administration signaled a desire to eliminate DEI efforts across the government and private sectors, including in colleges.\nThis resource aims to document the changes and help readers better understand how the campaign against DEI has actually reshaped campuses.\nThis tracker collects changes that public colleges have made to offices, jobs, training, diversity statements, and other DEI-related activities since January 2023, when The Chronicle began reporting on anti-DEI legislation. Most changes come as the result of bills, executive orders, system mandates, and other state-level actions, but more public colleges have started acting independently as anti-DEI pressure mounts. Some private colleges have also made changes and are included in our rundown. The information comes from a Chronicle survey, media reports, and tips from readers.\nThe Chronicle has tracked changes at 338 college campuses in 42 states and the District of Columbia.\nView more details by state and individual institution below.\nHelp The Chronicle track how colleges are changing their DEI efforts\nDo you know about a change that’s not listed here?

Rachel Rodriguez-Williams, a Republican, introduced a bill that would prohibit state-government entities, including the University of Wyoming and community colleges, from engaging in any diversity, equity, or inclusion program, activity, or policy. The legislation defines “diversity, equity, and inclusion” as “any program, activity, or policy that promotes differential or preferential treatment of individuals or classifies individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, ethnicity, or national origin.” In March 2025, Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, signed the bill into law.\nUniversity of Wyoming\nSummary of changes: Diversity statements; jobs; offices; other DEI-related activities\nDetails: The University of Wyoming eliminated its Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; eliminated its Black 14 Social Justice Summer Institute; reassigned employees in the office; eliminated diversity statements in hiring; developed a new definition of DEI, which the university outlined as any program that promotes the “position that the action of a group or an individual is inherently, unconsciously, or implicitly biased, privileged or inherently superior or inferior on the basis of color, sex, national origin, gender identity, or sexual orientation\"; replaced its Office of Multicultural Affairs with the Pokes Center for Community Resources; and cut ties with the PhD Project, a network and mentorship program for minority students seeking doctoral degrees in business.\nSource: University of Wyoming; WyoFile; Wyoming Tribune Eagle\nMethodology\nThis tracker collects changes that public colleges and some private colleges have made since January 2023 as a result of legislation, orders, or other state-level and institutional-level actions restricting diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts.\nThe tracker reflects The Chronicle’s survey findings of public colleges in Texas and Florida that have enacted legislation banning DEI offices and activities, as well as changes compiled by The Chronicle newsroom and responses submitted through an informal survey that anyone could fill out. (In a handful of states, even though politicians have not passed laws, their criticism of DEI has driven colleges to act.)\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe tracker is not meant to tally the total number of changes nationwide or at individual institutions. Rather, the aim is to help the public better understand how attacks on diversity efforts have reshaped college campuses. In cases where changes affected institutional systems, The Chronicle counted each individual campus as one college. The Chronicle counted community colleges with multiple campuses as singular entities based on their designations in the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System.\nFor public-survey responses to qualify for the tracker, respondents must list the impacted institution and provide concrete documentation of changes. The Chronicle accepts the following forms of evidence: media reports, university statements, screenshots of emails, and other official college communications and documents. The Chronicle independently vets submissions and publishes those that meet these criteria.\nThe Chronicle is using the following categories to classify changes: offices, jobs, training, diversity statements, and other DEI-related activities (including but not limited to funding, hiring practices, and admissions practices). The written text under each entry specifies the changes. When possible, The Chronicle will provide the names of programs or exact numbers, but this tracker errs on the side of caution with tallies as not to over represent the number of changes at an institution.\nRead other items in The Dismantling of DEI.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

Bucknell has been removed from the database.\nCorrection (Feb. 19, 2025, 6:30 p.m.): The item on Bates College stated that the institution had made diversity statements optional in faculty hiring, citing the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.

We searched for bills that would affect diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts identified in the model state legislation proposed in 2023 by the Goldwater Institute and the Manhattan Institute. In 2025, we also started tracking bills, based on Goldwater Institute’s model legislation, that would prohibit colleges from requiring classes to graduate that promote concepts such as systemic racism, reparations, and racial or gender diversity, or from offering student-orientation programs with such content. We supplemented those efforts by looking for articles about relevant legislation in local media outlets.\nIn some states, changes in diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts at public colleges have come from outside the legislature. For example, in a measure that appears to target diversity statements, the University of North Carolina system’s Board of Governors voted in February 2023 to prohibit colleges from asking applicants or employees to state or agree with certain viewpoints in hiring or admissions, while the governor of Oklahoma issued an executive order banning DEI practices. We did not include measures like those; instead, we focused on state legislation.\nEnrollment data represents only full-time students in the fall of 2023, and it comes from the U.S. Department of Education’s Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, known as Ipeds. Employee numbers also come from Ipeds and include only full-time workers. Percentages of nonwhite students and faculty members are calculated by taking the total population minus the white population.

Brock Read wrote today’s Briefing. Julia Piper compiled Transitions. Get in touch: dailybriefing@chronicle.com.\nSenate’s spin on ‘Big Beautiful Bill’\nLate Tuesday, Senate Republicans took their first stab at reinterpreting the overhaul of federal financial aid laid out in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed last month by the House amid a wave of opprobrium from higher ed. The draft plan, released by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, largely follows through on the House’s objectives.\nColleges with plenty of part-time students are breathing a deep sigh of relief. Community colleges were particularly panicked about a provision in the House bill that would require students to take 30 credit hours per academic year to receive the maximum Pell Grant award, and 15 credit hours to be eligible for Pell Grants at all.\nThe impact of the Pell shifts would be seismic. More than half of students in the country would fall short of the 30-credit standard, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. About 400,000 community-college students stood to lose their Pell Grants altogether, according to a letter sent by the Association of Community College Trustees to the Senate committee after the House bill passed.\nMessage received, apparently: Those thresholds are gone in the Senate plan. Students would remain Pell-eligible no matter how many credit hours they take, and the standard for full-time eligibility would stay at 24 credit hours per year. Language from both chambers would render borrowers with “a high student-aid index” ineligible.\nIf that holds, Pell could emerge as a bit of a winner overall. Like the House, the Senate would pump $10.5 billion into the grant program over three years and create a Workforce Pell program that makes the grant available for short-term work-force training.\nThe Senate may also nix a controversial plan to put colleges’ skin in the student-debt game. The House legislation would force colleges to foot some of the bill when their students default on federal loans. That risk-sharing model is gone in the Senate plan, though colleges could lose federal aid if their students fail to meet standards on median earnings and debt.\nIt’s worth remembering: The two chambers agree more than they differ here. Other key tenets of the House’s aid overhaul are largely untouched in the Senate plan:\nFewer lending options: Grad PLUS loans, which allow graduate and professional students to borrow unlimited amounts, would be eliminated. And Parent PLUS loans, which do the same for parents of undergraduates, would be restricted.\nStricter income-based repayment: Deferment options for borrowers claiming economic hardship would be kiboshed as well.\nWhat comes next: Reconciliation. President Trump is pushing to sign a bill by July 4. It seems glancingly unlikely that lawmakers from both chambers of Congress get the details squared away by then. But how hard will they push?\n📱 Read The Chronicle‘s breakdown of the bill that passed the House: Republicans’ Plans to Tax Higher Ed and Slash Funding Advances in Congress\nFederal news\nRubio seeks yet another Harvard investigation: Marco Rubio, secretary of state, urged the Treasury Department last month to investigate whether the university violated federal sanctions by participating for several years in a health-insurance conference in China. The conference included members of a state-run group that has been cited by the U.S. government as a perpetrator of systemic human-rights abuses. It’s unclear whether the Treasury chose to open an investigation. (The New York Times)\nJudge rejects pro-Palestinian student’s detainment: U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz yesterday barred the Trump administration from using a rarely invoked passage of federal law to continue to detain Mahmoud Khalil, a legal resident who is a pro-Palestinian activist at Columbia University. In citing the law, Secretary Rubio had argued that Khalil’s presence in the United States compromised its foreign-policy interests. While the judge rejected the argument, he paused his order until Friday to allow the Trump administration to appeal. (The New York Times)\nIs Social Security safe for student-loan defaulters? Linda McMahon, secretary of education, will not renew efforts to seize Social Security benefits from borrowers who defaulted on student loans, said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, after the two spoke earlier this week. The Education Department announced in April that it would garnish those benefits but soon put the plan on hold. (Politico)\nTrump touts trade truce: The president said yesterday on his Truth Social platform that he’d struck a deal with China to keep tariffs at the levels agreed to by the two countries last month. One stipulation: The U.S. will back off on its plan to revoke the visas of Chinese students studying at American colleges. (The Wall Street Journal)\nFulbright board members quit in protest: Members of the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board have resigned en masse to protest the Trump administration’s vetting of scholarship recipients on ideological grounds. In a statement published yesterday, the board members said the administration’s eleventh-hour denial of Fulbright awards to both American and foreign applicants were “impermissible by law” and “compromise U.S. national interests and integrity.” (Substack, The Chronicle)\nJoin us today\n📺 We’re going live this summer to talk Trump, Congress, and all the other federal shakeups hitting higher ed.

(Associated Press)\nAnti-DEI bill dies in Louisiana: The State Senate declined to advance legislation that would have prohibited state colleges from requiring any curriculum “that promotes the differential treatment of any individual or group of individuals based on race or ethnicity, imputed bias, or other ideology related to diversity, equity, or inclusion.” (Louisiana Illuminator)\n“Diversity Way” goes away: Florida Atlantic University has rechristened a campus walkway, named 15 years ago, as “Opportunity Way.” A professor criticized the move as “an empty symbolic act.” (University Press)\nDEI drama at WCU: An activist conservative group is touting a newly released video, in which an administrator describes a goal to “embed” diversity and inclusion campuswide, as evidence that Western Carolina University is failing to comply with federal and state laws mandating that it shutter DEI programs. A Western Carolina spokesperson said the university adheres to all relevant laws, and that the administrator, who retired in April, “was not authorized to speak on behalf of the university.” An earlier video, in which a student confronted a transgender woman in a women’s bathroom, prompted the Education Department to open a civil-rights investigation of the university.

(Higher Ed Dive)\nQuote of the day\n“It was kind of a hard hammer at first.”\n—Linda McMahon, secretary of education, said in an interview with Bloomberg that the Trump administration’s aggressive moves to yank funding from elite institutions have prompted other colleges to review their policies. When asked whether institutions like Harvard, Columbia, and Princeton might see federal money return, she cited “progress” in negotiations: “It would be my goal that if colleges and universities are abiding by the laws of the United States, and doing what we’re expecting of them, that they could expect to have taxpayer-funded programs.”\nTransitions\nDon Oberhelman, director of athletics at California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, will retire.\nCam Patterson, chancellor of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, plans to step down.\nKimberly L.

Gordon Gee, the man who has seemed destined to be at the reins of some university, somewhere, until the end of time.\nYou probably know the biographical basics: Forty-four years as a college president, seven stints at five different institutions, virtually no time off between any of those gigs. What, if anything, could make Gee call it quits?\nThe Chronicle reporters who have profiled Gee have struggled to come up with answers that don’t seem, well, a bit morbid. As our Jack Stripling memorably put it in 2012:\nIt has been said that the only survivors of a nuclear holocaust will be cockroaches and Cher. At this point, it might seem reasonable to add E. Gordon Gee to that list.\nOr as Gee himself told Emma Pettit last year, recalling faculty critics who had said back in 1981 that he didn’t seem up to the top job:\nDespite his poor start, Gee, now 80, is still a university president. As for the professors who insisted he change?\n“Those guys are dead.”\nThe headline of Emma’s piece, which took stock of Gee’s controversial second stint at the helm of West Virginia University, seemed both inarguably true and somehow a little gutsy: Gordon Gee’s Last Stand. (It had to be, right? And yet ...) Emma did, of course, get it right: Gee announced last September that he’d retire this June. Michael T. Benson, president of Coastal Carolina University, was tapped as his successor. Finally, Gee would get his turn as éminence grise, and it wouldn’t take a nuclear holocaust to make it happen.\nStill, we at the Daily Briefing got a little jolt this week when WV News reported that West Virginia’s Board of Governors would vote this week to extend Gee’s contract. Did we dream the whole retirement thing? Will Gee’s presidencies outlive us after all? No, and no. This is a mere procedural matter — a two-week extension to make sure the university isn’t leaderless between the end of June and Benson’s start date of July 15. On that day, Gee will make good on his plans to “disappear for a year” and spend more time with his grandchildren.\nWe think.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nMore News\nSeeking precedent\nFunding for Hispanic-Serving Institutions Is Discriminatory and Unconstitutional, Lawsuit Argues\nFinance\nSmall Colleges Are Banding Together Against a Higher Endowment Tax.

Get in touch: dailybriefing@chronicle.com.\nGrant whiplash\nKeep an eye on a delicate dance unfolding around new conditions the Trump administration is trying to attach to federal grants.\nThe National Institutes of Health yanked, then reinstated, new ideological grant requirements on Monday, STAT reported. The rules, which date back to April, require colleges to certify that they don’t run illegal diversity, equity, and inclusion programs or boycott Israel to tap federal research funding.\nWilliams College has paused accepting new grants because of such terms. The Massachusetts liberal-arts college became the first-known institution to take such a stance when it told faculty members at the end of May that it was holding off on accepting new grants from the NIH and the National Science Foundation, Science reported.\n“This new condition goes well beyond a standard certification that the college comply with all applicable nondiscrimination laws,” Eiko Siniawer, the provost, and Lara Shore-Sheppard, dean of faculty, wrote in an email to faculty members, according to Science.\nFourteen NSF grants are under review at Williams. The college isn’t evaluating any NIH grants.\nThe NSF has maintained its own anti-DEI and anti-BDS grant requirements. A spokesperson confirmed to the Daily Briefing that the conditions, put in place in May, are still in effect.\nDid Williams take a principled stand … for clarification? “The college decided on May 30 to temporarily pause acceptance of funds from new NSF or NIH grants to allow for a thorough review amid the rapidly evolving federal enforcement environment,” a spokesperson said in an email to the Daily Briefing.\n“We have already made significant progress toward the clarity we need to resume certification,” the spokesperson added.\nThe Williams pause left faculty members divided, according to Science. Some saw it as the college upholding its values. Others think it harms research. The college’s website says DEI is “inextricably linked to educational excellence,” The Boston Globe noted.\nThe bigger picture: Whether or not they’re willing to comply with new strings on federal funding, colleges are walking a fine line. On one side, the Trump administration is very willing to make life miserable for college leaders. On the other, activists are itching for someone to tell the government to pound sand. Watch small wealthy colleges that draw relatively few federal research dollars, because they may be best positioned to tell the government “no” if they think it goes a bridge too far.\nFederal news\nFormer college presidents lobby against Big, Beautiful Bill: More than 100 former college leaders signed on to a letter to Senate leaders that calls House Republicans’ omnibus legislation “an unprecedented retreat from the federal effort to equalize access to postsecondary education.” The letter, which was shared with the Daily Briefing, specifically criticizes proposed cuts to Pell Grants, student lending, and Medicaid, as well as plans to increase the endowment tax and create a risk-sharing mechanism to penalize colleges for unpaid student loans.\nStates land on consumer-protection front lines: As Republicans work to loosen federal oversight, advocates for regulating online-program managers and short-term certificate programs are pushing blueprints for states to take action. State offices have also been flooded with questions from student-loan borrowers as a vastly slimmed-down U.S. Department of Education pushes a return to repayment. (New America, The Institute for College Access & Success, Stateline)\nBig bill for Education Department employees who aren’t allowed to work: The agency has paid $21 million to employees who it moved to fire three months ago, according to the union that represents them. They were originally to have been placed on leave through June 9, then terminated. But they remain on administrative leave, paid but unable to work, amid court challenges. (CNN)\nHouse jumps on Harvard hiring probe: Republicans on the Committee on Education and Workforce asked the university to share information on how it considers race, color, religion, sex, and national origin when recruiting and hiring. The inquiry comes after the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission moved toward starting its own investigation, suggesting Harvard’s practices may violate antidiscrimination laws. The university maintains that it hires based on merit. (Committee on Education and Workforce, The Chronicle)\nQuick hits\nGoverning-board appointees rejected in Virginia: Senate Democrats said they were protecting their values on Monday when they voted down several appointments from Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican. Among those rejected was Kenneth Cuccinelli, former Virginia attorney general and official in the first Trump administration, whom Youngkin had selected for a closely watched seat on the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors. Senate Democrats vowed not to approve board members they view as unable to understand fiduciary duties, commit to independent governance, or avoid excessive partisanship. (Virginia Mercury, The Chronicle)\nUniversity of Florida board chair survives failed presidential pick: Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, reappointed Fred Ridley and Morteza (Mori) Hosseini to the flagship’s Board of Trustees. Hosseini, the board’s chair, has publicly defended the decision to try to hire Santa Ono as the university’s president even after the pick, which drew criticism from conservatives, was rejected by the university system’s governing board. (WCJB, University of Florida, The Chronicle)\nSurvivors of Michigan State shooting settle: The university agreed to pay a total of $30 million to three people who were injured in the deadly 2023 campus shooting. One will also receive free tuition, room, board, and health insurance as he completes undergraduate and graduate degrees. (WJBK, The Chronicle)\nSports report\nPrivate equity primed for college athletics: A $500-million effort backed by Texas’s sovereign wealth fund and the private-equity firm Velocity Capital Management wants to help finance capital projects for college athletic programs. It could fill in when financing options like bonds don’t suffice, receiving in exchange a cut of future revenue. It comes as major athletic departments are widely expected to undertake capital projects in search of new revenue streams to help pay for a $2.8-billion antitrust settlement. (Sports Business Journal, The Chronicle)\nU. of Michigan plans cuts: The flagship’s athletic department wants to use attrition to reduce staff by 10 percent in the face of the college sports antitrust settlement that will have institutions directly paying athletes. The university has committed to paying players the full amount allowed under the settlement, expected to be $20.5 million in the upcoming year.

Suggs allegedly used her employer’s card for more than $24,000 in personal purchases and listed unauthorized spending as meals on expense reports. The university said it’s monitoring the situation.

Now comes the hard part: enforcing the deal’s terms in a way that keeps campuses happy, gets athletes on board, and convinces fans that the rocky road ahead looks something like an even playing field.\nMeet Bryan Seeley, the 46-year-old chief executive of the new College Sports Commission. He takes the job after serving as head of investigations for Major League Baseball, whose teams don’t have a hard salary cap but are restricted when spending to sign international amateur talent.\n“I think I’m one of the few people in the country who’s probably led investigations into salary-cap circumvention,” Seeley told The Athletic.\nCap talk comes first because the College Sports Commission will enforce key rules under the landmark antitrust settlement. The commission oversees the “revenue-sharing” payments colleges can now send directly to players, as well as name, image, and likeness payments between third parties and athletes.\nHere’s a refresher on the settlement basics:\nColleges can directly pay athletes up to 22 percent of the average revenue that power-conference colleges draw from media rights, ticket sales, and sponsorship. That’s estimated to be up to $20.5 million per institution for the upcoming year, and more going forward.\nAthletes can still strike NIL deals with third parties as long as they’re made “for a valid business purpose and do not exceed a reasonable range of compensation.” The consultancy Deloitte built a new clearinghouse to ensure that deals valued at $600 or more comply.\nRoster limits are here, replacing restrictions on how many scholarships athletic departments can give out.\nPast players get back pay. About $2.8 billion has been earmarked for athletes who competed between 2016 and 2024. The NCAA and conferences are footing that bill, effectively by reducing the payouts they send colleges from money makers like March Madness basketball, the Associated Press noted.\nConferences need the commission to keep their members in line. Power-conference commissioners make up the College Sports Commission’s board. Their college members are expected to sign agreements dictating that they will follow rulings issued by Seeley and arbitrators.\nYet no one’s ready to say exactly what happens when a college breaks the rules. Violators will face “punitive” measures, Brett Yormark, commissioner of the Big 12, said on Monday, according to ESPN. “We’re in the process of developing some of those rules and structure,” Jim Phillips, commissioner of the ACC, said on Monday.\nCan the College Sports Commission succeed where the NCAA couldn’t? “For several years, Division I members crafted well-intentioned rules and systems to govern financial benefits from schools and name, image, and likeness opportunities, but the NCAA could not easily enforce these for several reasons,” NCAA President Charlie Baker wrote. “The result was a sense of chaos: instability for schools, confusion for student-athletes, and too often litigation.”\nNow the NCAA doesn’t have to worry about athlete pay. It will still be in charge of academic and eligibility rules, “minimal” recruiting rules, and regulations covering playing seasons and sports betting.\nBut make no mistake, this isn’t the end of the fight over college athletics. Looming issues include:\nAre athletes employees? The NCAA staunchly opposes such a change, which could open the door to a players’ union.\nState legislation: States helped bring about the current free-for-all by passing laws preempting NCAA rules. There’s nothing to stop them from doing the same thing here so their home teams have a leg up in recruiting.\nTitle IX and equity: Though they have flexibility, institutions are generally expected to send 75 percent of revenue-sharing payments to football, 15 percent to men’s basketball, 5 percent to women’s basketball, and 5 percent to other sports.\nAntitrust: Last week’s settlement could leave institutions exposed to future lawsuits alleging illegal collusion in college athletics.\n“We’re not going to have Final Fours and College Football Playoffs and College World Series with 50 different standards,” said Greg Sankey, commissioner of the SEC, according to ESPN. Writing the settlement into law would be “enormously healthy,” he added.\nAt least some congressional Republicans seem ready to give athletic power brokers what they want. Draft legislation from two House committees would block state laws that conflict with rules set by the NCAA and its conferences, bar college athletes from being classified as employees, and carve out an antitrust exemption for college sports, The Washington Post reported on Monday.\nWhat’s next: The NIL clearinghouse is set to go live on Wednesday. Colleges that weren’t named in the lawsuits have until June 15 to opt in to the revenue-sharing terms. Revenue sharing starts July 1.\nThe bigger question: If the settlement creates a level playing field across college athletics, institutions in the power conferences still get to start on the opposing team’s 20-yard line. How long will it take for future players, colleges in smaller conferences, and state lawmakers to stop buying into the latest set of rules they’ve had precious little say in shaping?\n📱 For more from The Chronicle: Judge Approves Landmark Settlement Changing the Way College Sports Are Run\nFederal news\nHarvard turns over program in the pressure cooker: None of the original leaders of Harvard University’s Religion and Public Life program will remain after June 30, and five remaining staff members were told last week that their contracts won’t be renewed. The program was singled out by the Trump administration as needing more oversight, and it was identified by a university report on antisemitism as having problems. The program has a new permanent director. (The Chronicle)\nUniversities back Harvard in court: Two dozen institutions, including Princeton and the Johns Hopkins Universities, have asked for permission to file “friend of the court” briefs in support of Harvard University’s legal battle against the Trump administration. Their arguments include that the government’s attempts to cut federal funding for Harvard threaten more broadly to harm research, hurt scientists’ careers, and undercut investment in higher ed. (Court Listener, Bloomberg Law)\nNIH employees decry research changes: More than 60 National Institutes of Health employees on Monday signed a letter accusing the Trump administration of censoring research, illegally withholding funding, and endangering study participants. Signatories said they fear being fired but cannot follow directions they see as unethical or illegal. Jay Bhattacharya, the NIH director, replied that “respectful dissent in science is productive,” even as he described the letter as containing “fundamental misconceptions” about the agency’s policies. (The New York Times)\nSmall colleges hope to be spared from endowment-tax hike: Two dozen liberal-arts colleges are lobbying to pay lower rates than large research universities if Congress forges ahead with plans to raise the excise tax on investment income. Their ideas include adopting a different tax rate for institutions with fewer than 5,000 students, creating a carveout for religiously affiliated institutions, and sparing colleges from the highest tax brackets if they meet thresholds for high financial-aid spending or enrollment of low-income students. The lobbying comes as wealthy institutions have sought to stave off a higher tax by suggesting they’d agree to 5-percent annual endowment-spending rates. (Politico)\nWho here knows how to use IPEDS? The Trump administration is not renewing a contract with an association that trains college officials to submit key statistics to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. The U.S. Department of Education said it’s evaluating how to deliver the training more efficiently, but observers are concerned reporting accuracy could slip. The contractor, the Association of Institutional Research, says it’s looking for ways to keep offering training under its own brand, though institutions won’t be able to tap it for free, as they could previously.

High-income students were more likely than others to nix colleges they saw as too liberal or too conservative. Six in 10 students said a safe campus includes the freedom to express thoughts without harassment, up from 55 percent last year. (EAB)\nU. of Michigan dumps security contractors amid surveillance scandal: The flagship is cutting ties with plainclothes security contractors after one company’s employees were accused of following pro-Palestinian activists on and off campus. Officials said one contractor’s behavior was “disturbing, unacceptable, and unethical” without offering further details. The university said it hired contractors to report on suspicious activity in heavily trafficked areas, not to do surveillance. (Associated Press, The Guardian)\nPresident on leave after cover-up allegations: Truett McConnell University, a Christian institution in Georgia, placed its president, Emir Caner, on administrative leave and hired an independent investigator. A lawyer alleged that the president failed to act on allegations from a former student, who said she was groomed and raped by a former administrator. Caner, who has led the institution since 2008, has denied that a cover-up took place. (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution)\nProfessor on leave over video clip: Portland State University placed a faculty member on administrative leave after she was shown in a 7-second video clip answering an interviewer’s questions by saying “I am Hamas” and “We are all Hamas.” The video appeared to have been recorded at a rally to support a local school board member who’s being investigated for posting online that Israel should “stop the genocide” in Gaza. President Ann Cudd condemned the comments as “absolutely unacceptable.” (Willamette Week)\nTransitions\nAntoinette M.

Then find hope, for at least a moment, in the young people who reject parts of the last digital revolution that went wrong.\nSeán Killingsworth, 22, started hosting gatherings with friends after he enrolled in college. Those grew into the Reconnect Movement, which now counts chapters at several institutions.\n“It’s a way to see and be able to experience what is possible with just connecting with a group of people for no reason and just hanging out purely to hang out,” Killingsworth told USA Today. “That doesn’t really happen anymore, because everything’s so facilitated and planned out by technology.”\nThe smartphone, with its dopamine-driving doomscrolling and distractions, tends to be out with such students. The flip phone, with its bare-bones calling and texting capabilities, is much more likely to be in.\nYes, the difficulties of navigating young adulthood without ride-hailing services and dating apps have reportedly caused some young Luddites to fall off the wagon. But even those who’d never swear off a smartphone would do well to think critically about building a world that’s a little more concrete and a little less digital hallucination.\nCollege students have turned to the likes of vinyl, print books, and even typewriters. “It’s a craving for connection, both social and tactile — to feel and experience things, to be present in a given moment,” as The Chronicle’s Maddie Khaw put it in April.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nMore News\nSeeking precedent\nFunding for Hispanic-Serving Institutions Is Discriminatory and Unconstitutional, Lawsuit Argues\nFinance\nSmall Colleges Are Banding Together Against a Higher Endowment Tax.

Kelly Field visited a program in Alabama for The Chronicle to find out how it works and why there aren’t more like it.\nThe “earn while you learn” apprenticeship model is popular among business leaders and lawmakers from both parties — including President Trump. Advocates were encouraged when Trump issued an executive order in April that promised to support more than one million apprenticeships per year.\nThe idea comes from the United Kingdom, where last year nearly 90 universities offered “degree apprenticeships.” In England and Wales, students can earn them in a range of fields, including business, engineering, health care, and law.\nIn the United States, four-year institutions are only beginning to offer apprentice degrees. Most are in education, followed by nursing. But the National Center for the Apprenticeship Degree, at Reach University in Oakland, Calif., is working nationwide to expand the model to many more fields, calling three million enrollments in the next 10 years an achievable goal.\nHere’s how it can work on the ground: Albertville, Ala., has experienced a huge influx of immigrants and needs more bilingual teachers to work with English-language learners. School-district employees combining evening classes with credit for their time on the job can earn a four-year degree for less than $4,000. Nearly three-quarters of the students, most of whom are low-income, graduate on time. Compare that to 64 percent — the national six-year graduation rate.\nBut several barriers stand in the way to expanding such programs.\nState and federal funding are unreliable. Compared with European countries, the United States spends a pittance on apprenticeships. Within weeks of his executive order promising money, Trump released a budget seeking a $1.64-billion cut to work-force programs and scotching a $13-million contract to support the development of educator apprenticeships.\nEven when the funding is there, getting it is tough. Programs that want work-force-development money have to become “registered apprenticeships,” an expensive and time-consuming process.\nNot all faculty members are keen on the idea. The curriculum must be designed in collaboration with employers — not an easy task — and some professors worry that it waters down a college degree.\nStill, advocates are optimistic. “Once this administration is finished tearing things down, it’s going to start building things up,” Ryan Craig, the author of Apprentice Nation, told Kelly. “And I think apprenticeship is one of the things they’re going to get behind.”\nHelp is on the way: A coalition of state and industry leaders just announced the Education and Apprenticeship Accelerator to advance policies that support college-and-career training.\nThe bigger question: Can degree apprenticeships be scaled up soon enough to stave off plummeting enrollments? In today’s tough market, colleges face stiff competition from nondegree pathways.\nFor more from The Chronicle:\n📱 Read the full story here: The Slow Rise of the Apprentice Degree\n🔨 Learn more about reskilling workers: The Different Voices of Student Success\nQuick hits\nPay-for-play is officially here: An antitrust settlement approved Friday puts to rest three cases by setting up a new revenue-sharing structure that will allow Division I institutions to directly send $20.5 million to their athletes each year starting in July. Athletes who competed in the last decade are also set to receive $2.8 billion over 10 years. Players will still be able to sign name, image, and likeness deals with outside organizations, but those agreements are set to be overseen by a new clearinghouse. Approval of the terms have long been expected, but it’s not clear that the arrangement will stave off additional antitrust cases, Title IX challenges, and conflicts with state laws. (The Chronicle)\nU. of Michigan tails activists: The flagship allegedly hired private security contractors to trail and record students who are members of pro-Palestinian groups, on and off campus. Evidence the contractors gathered has been used in university disciplinary proceedings and criminal proceedings. The university said in a statement that it hasn’t received any complaints, is focused on maintaining safety, and hasn’t singled anyone out based on their beliefs or affiliations. (The Guardian)\nFaculty balk at West Bank partnership: A group of professors, alumni, and students petitioned for University of Utah President Taylor Randall to back out of a partnership with Ariel University, which is in the West Bank, an area that’s internationally recognized as Palestinian territory. They argue that by signing a memorandum that refers to Ariel as being in Israel, the university is taking a position on the Israel-Palestine conflict and violating state institutional-neutrality rules. The university’s provost maintained that the memorandum is focused on academic and research exchange. (The Salt Lake Tribune)\nMaryland blocks new program: The state’s Higher Education Commission ruled that a proposed interior-design program at the Maryland Institute College of Art would be too similar to an offering from the nearby Morgan State University. MICA leaders had argued the new program was key to a turnaround plan. But the state has increasingly protected its historically Black institutions after a 2021 settlement that put to rest long-running claims the state had hurt HBCUs by not providing them with adequate funding and by allowing other institutions to copy their programs. (The Baltimore Banner)\nPurdue drops student newspaper: The university ended a longstanding agreement under which its employees would distribute newspapers that were dropped off at campus loading docks, The Purdue Exponent reported. It also asked the newspaper not to use the word “Purdue” commercially, although the publication holds a trademark on its name until 2029. University lawyers cited an expired 2014 contract and institutional-neutrality policy that was updated last year. (The Purdue Exponent)\nFederal news\nNew live FAFSA verification requirements: The U.S. Department of Education on Friday announced a crackdown on financial-aid fraud that will require all students who are selected to verify their identity to show photo identification in person or on a live video conference. The extra verification, expected to apply to 125,000 students this summer, will be in place until the department issues new guidance. That guidance is expected in time for the fall term, according to officials. The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators backed efforts to reduce fraud but worried that, without a clear schedule for implementing new rules, the temporary verification processes could become “another burden put on institutions for an indeterminate amount of time.” (U.S. Department of Education, The Chronicle, NASFAA)\nJudge puts Trump’s latest Harvard punishment on hold: U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs issued a temporary restraining order last week blocking the Trump administration’s second attempt to cut off international enrollment at Harvard University. President Trump cited national security in an executive order that sought to bar international students from entering the country to go to Harvard, while the university argued the administration is turning some 7,000 visa holders into “pawns in the government’s escalating campaign of retaliation.” The judge also extended an order blocking an earlier government attempt to kick Harvard out of the student-visa system. (NPR, The New York Times)\nCalifornia funding in jeopardy? The Trump administration is reportedly considering terminating all federal grant funding for the University of California and California State University systems as it escalates conflicts over state policies including on energy and immigration. The government has weighed citing alleged antisemitism on campus. (CNN)\nCan spending promises ward off endowment-tax increase? Several wealthy universities have been lobbying against Republican plans to raise the endowment tax to as much as 21 percent by saying they’d agree to spend 5 percent of their endowments’ value each year. A 5-percent spending rate is considered standard for endowments, but many of the richest universities regularly fall short of that mark. Estimates from the institutions pitching the plan suggest it would have them spending more on priorities like financial aid and teaching by at least $30 billion over a decade. (The Wall Street Journal)\nICE stopped from arresting Columbia student: Immigration officials have been seeking to detain Yunseo Chung since March because she took part in a pro-Palestinian protest. They want to send the 21-year-old U.S. permanent resident to South Korea, where she hasn’t lived since she was 7. U.S. District Judge Naomi Reice Buchwald issued a preliminary injunction last week preventing Chung from being taken into custody after her lawyers argued she’s being punished for protected speech. (The Washington Post)\nCuts, cuts, cuts\nDuke plans faculty buyouts: President Vincent Price said the university “will, for the foreseeable future, have to be smaller — and do our work with fewer people” in the face of federal funding cuts. Eligible faculty members will receive voluntary retirement offers within several weeks, with staff layoffs likely to follow. It’s the second round of buyouts offered after a voluntary staff-separation program announced in April. (The News & Observer)\nIndiana State axes positions: The university eliminated 32 jobs, 20 of which were vacant, as it restructures amid declining enrollment and a 5-percent state funding cut. (Indiana Public Media)\nCOLAs dry up for California Community Colleges: Dozens of institutions in the state’s sprawling system face increased budgetary pressure under a performance-based funding model adopted in 2018 because “cost of living” adjustments are set to expire at the end of the month. The state has been making extra payments meant to cover rising expenses like building maintenance, education materials, and employee benefits. Some institutions have cut jobs and classes. (CalMatters)\nGolden Gate U. primed for campus sale: The nonprofit institution entered into an agreement that could lead to the sale and redevelopment of its campus in downtown San Francisco. Leaders said the deal will bolster Golden Gate’s deficit-plagued finances and that it will be able to stay in its current campus for at least the upcoming year. Records show Texas-based Lincoln Property Co. provided a $22-million loan to pay the university’s debt on the site. (San Francisco Chronicle)\nWashington State U. pares back budget: The university’s board of regents adopted a budget with a 4.1-percent, $17.1-million spending reduction for the upcoming year that will likely lead to personnel cuts. The College of Arts and Sciences, College of Medicine, libraries, external affairs, research, and law enforcement units will be spared from cuts, leaving the university’s 35 other units needing to slash spending by as much as 10 percent. That state has cut higher-ed funding, and the university’s enrollment has been declining.

That work went into a paper they published last week detailing homicide patterns in the 14th-century English cities of London, York, and Oxford.\nOxford’s homicide rate was shockingly high in part because so many students lived there. They were the majority of both the victims and the suspects, Eisner told The Washington Post. Young men living away from home often fought — with each other, with townspeople, and in gangs.\nFortunately past events are not necessarily predictive of future behavior. Some other trends looked very different in the past, too: Most killers escaped conviction, and killings frequently took place in high-trafficked and affluent areas.\nThanks to Andrew Mytelka, a retired Chronicle editor, for sharing this story. He also offered an observation that suggests scholars may not have lost all of their proclivity for ganging up on each other.\n“I think it’s notable that the Cambridge scholars chose to highlight the murderous tendencies of their rivals at Oxford,” Mytelka said in an email.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nMore News\nSeeking precedent\nFunding for Hispanic-Serving Institutions Is Discriminatory and Unconstitutional, Lawsuit Argues\nFinance\nSmall Colleges Are Banding Together Against a Higher Endowment Tax.

But I compartmentalize this to think, ah, what’s the big deal? It’s one kid, he gets his chance to go to a school that he’s qualified to go academically, but the test is going to stop him from getting into any good school that he wants to go to.\nJack Stripling In an expansive college admissions scheme that led to the convictions of more than 50 parents, coaches, and others, one man stood out as uniquely culpable. Over a decade, according to prosecutors, William (Rick) Singer, a college consultant, orchestrated an elaborate system of bribery and fraud with one goal in mind: Helping wealthy families to secure admission for their children / into highly-selective universities, including Yale, Stanford, and Georgetown. Details of the scheme, which first came to public light in 2019, were discovered by investigators in what became known as Operation Varsity Blues. Singer’s clients, who included wealthy financiers and Hollywood celebrities, went to often absurd lengths to get their children into prestigious colleges — agreeing to pay off coaches, and fraudulently passing off their children as college-level athletes. After pleading guilty to four felonies, Singer spent 16 months at a federal prison work camp in Pensacola, Florida. He’s done his time. And he’s now living in Newport Beach, Calif., where he’s already back to work as a college consultant. In a recent interview, I asked him to reflect on how he lost his way. What followed was an at-times contentious conversation with Singer, a pugnacious former college basketball coach, who still seems to want to win at everything — including the interview.\nJack Stripling Well, Rick Singer, welcome to College Matters from the Chronicle.\nRick Singer I appreciate it. Thank you for having me.\nJack Stripling So you’re talking to us after having served 16 months in a federal prison camp for your role in the admissions bribery scandal that became known as Varsity Blues. You’ve had a lot of time to think about what happened. When you look back on this, is there something in particular that still haunts you about it?\nRick Singer What haunts me is I have not had an opportunity, because the DOJ would not allow me to, is actually contact all those that were involved and say I’m sorry that I put them through what they went through. And also speak to those that weren’t involved in this and just say I am sorry if I tarnished anything that’s happened in your life and your reputations because you had nothing to do with this, but my name was involved in it.\nJack Stripling You had run for many years a legitimate college consulting business, but at some point in time you started crossing ethical and legal lines. And I’m curious, I don’t know if you can remember, Rick, but I have been thinking about this. What’s your first specific memory of crossing one of those lines?\nRick Singer To be frank with you, I don’t believe that I crossed that line — the ethical and legal line — for a long time. But I will tell you the first time I felt a little different because I was asked to help a family that was based in Vancouver, and a gentleman by the name of David Sidoo came down from Vancouver to LA. And he had a problem that he wanted to know if I could fix for him. That problem was that his eldest, was known as the best student at his school, and I believe that school was St. George’s, which is I think perceived as the best school in Vancouver. And this was a young man that was very well liked, had great grades, performing arts kid, wanted to be in the film world. And his biggest issue was, for his eldest, was that he was not a good test taker. And no matter how much tutoring the family paid for that the son did he still could not perform very well. And he wanted to go to one of the best film schools — USC being one of them; Chapman being the other, because Chapman was perceived as the second best film school in the country at that time; NYU third. But he would need, despite his talent and what he could produce, he would need a decent test score to go along with his grades. And he asked me, could I do something to enhance his scores? And I used my creative abilities. And at that time, the test was given as a hard copy. It was given as …\nJack Stripling This is an SAT test, correct?\nRick Singer An SAT test, right. And when you came to take the test, all you had to do — cause you went to a national test center — all you had to do was show your ID. That was your high school ID. So he had some learning differences already and he was already being given 50 percent extended time. So I asked the family if getting the extended time would make it so that his test scores would go up with additional tutoring. They had tested him with additional time and his scores went up slightly but not significantly. So, my idea was, if we could get him 100 percent extended time, then we could take the test — not at a national test center, but at his school or at another school that would be, is willing to give the test to kids that need 100 percent time. So we tried to get him tested for a 100 percent more time, and unfortunately he did not qualify. So now what do we do? So I thought that the person that I could find that could take the test for him was a brilliant young man and still looked young. His name was Mark Riddell. Mark worked for us at IMG…\nJack Stripling Rick, I’m sorry to interrupt you, but I feel like we skipped right into where you felt like you’d crossed the line. You at some point, when these other methods weren’t working out, decided, I am going to pay somebody else to take this test for my client’s kid.\nRick Singer That’s correct.\nJack Stripling Was that a big decision for you?\nRick Singer Frankly, I think I compartmentalized it and said, hey this is one kid. I don’t think I thought about that it was such a bad thing. I knew it was cheating — 100 percent knew it was cheating. However, I looked at is though you know what people cheat all the time; they cheat on tests. I have people calling me every time the SAT and ACT is taken across the world and being told that kids are in the bathroom sharing the answers to the tests. Kids from China, kids from overseas are sending pictures of the tests to kids into the bathroom and then they’re using those answers. So am I right? Absolutely, I’m 100 percent wrong. But I compartmentalize this to think, ah, what’s the big deal? It’s one kid. He gets his chance to go to a school that he’s qualified to go academically, but the test is going to stop him from getting into any good school that he wants to go to.\nJack Stripling And you had more or less convinced yourself that so many people were dishonest in this arena that what’s one more person?\nRick Singer That’s correct. I rationalized the situation and I was 100 percent wrong. But at the time I rationalized it, and I did the same thing multiple times again — not the same kind of situation, but I helped families and kids cheat on the test more than once. So this was the, you asked, when was the first time? This is the first time. And I had Mark Riddell, who lived in Florida, and worked at IMG Academies as a tutor and a tennis instructor, take the test for the young man. So what we had was the young man sent me his ID, and we repurposed the ID and put Mark’s picture on his ID. At that time then, we didn’t take the tests at his school or at a national test center near the school in Vancouver. We took it somewhere else where Mark could walk in and be that student and nobody would know any different.\nJack Stripling Riddell pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud, and one count conspiracy to commit money laundering. And Mr. Sidoo, who you mentioned earlier, has also pleaded to crimes associated with the Varsity Blues scandal.\nRick Singer That is correct. And then Mark took the test for the young man, scored a score that I asked him to score, and that helped him get himself into all the schools that he wanted to go to.\nJack Stripling I’m curious, Rick, as you look back on this, you’re giving me kind of a, almost a blasé rendition of this, that you knew it was wrong, but you kind of didn’t see it was a big deal. The prosecutors say that you paid off the test proctors, which we’ve talked about, and administrators to cheat on college entrance exams, that you facilitated the bribing of athletics coaches to pass off your clients’ children as athletes for admission. You took enormous professional and personal risk to do this. And, as I hear you talk, I’m not sure whether you were fully conscious of how big the risks were. Were you?\nRick Singer Absolutely not. Like in this test taking, to me, I mean, I knew it was a risk, but you know, it’s one kid. It’s one kid here, it’s one kid there. And again, if you know what goes on every Saturday that the SAT or ACT is being given, and how much cheating is going on, and then how much cheating is going on at every high school in America on every AP exam, exams given at schools. I thought, no big deal.\nJack Stripling I’m curious how you evaluate yourself as a college counselor, though. Did you really figure out something people didn’t understand about college admissions? Or is it just that you were willing to do things that were wrong?\nRick Singer Well, I think what you forget about is that I had thousands of kids that went through our for-profit company and did everything legitimately. And I spent more time than, I would say most of these other people who say they’re college counselors, getting to know every university and getting to know all the people on these university staffs. I spent every summer visiting 50 to 60 schools across the country at all sizes, at all levels of schools, and getting to know everybody on that campus I could. So I got to know the admissions people, I got to know the international admissions people. I got to know the president’s staff. I got to know all the dorm people. I got everybody, and students on that campus, so that when I referred a student to a particular school, I could tell you what they’re serving in the dining commons. I could tell you exactly what the dorms look like and the multiple dorms. I could tell you what the fitness facilities were like. I could tell you the philosophy of the university executive council. I could tell you the philosophy of the admissions people, because I actually know them personally, can pick up the phone and call them. So, to give you an example. Let’s say you had a child and your child was applying to x-college and we wanted a status of where you fall within that admissions person’s group that they were reading for that geographic area. If I didn’t know you, I could call somebody on that staff and that staff member would find out for me personally where you fall in the eyes of that admissions person reading your application and or the committee.\nJack Stripling Can you make that call anymore, Rick? You’ve expressed interest in getting back into college counseling. I’m curious whether anybody at a university is picking up the phone for Rick Singer now.\nRick Singer Oh, they’re already calling me. You got people calling me, asking me, especially now that you have in athletics, you have an NIL and collective issue going on all over the country where athletes are transferring from schools, to schools, to schools. And the boosters, which are the collectives, are now funding the payment to athletes to come to schools. They’re getting money from their alumnus. But they also need money from the outside. Within three days of me being released from Pensacola, I’ve received no less than 20 phone calls from 20 different collectives asking me if I’d be interested in partnering with them and raising money for them. Now, with President Trump making a decision on taking monies away from universities that do not want to follow his legislation that he’s trying to put forward with DEI, I have universities now calling me asking me, if we lose our funding, is there a way to help our funding, and do you know families and others that would be willing to donate to our school?\nJack Stripling I have to say, Rick, I’m really surprised to hear this. I would think that you would be, respectfully, considered a toxic person in higher education now.\nRick Singer And you’re probably right. But that is probably those people that don’t understand that higher education is a business. And you got to figure out from a business perspective, how are you going to fund the programs that you have? How are you gonna continue to grow your university’s reputation? So, if you think about it, there’s 20 to 40 schools every year that are going to close because they don’t have enrollment numbers and they don’t have money. How are you funding all these programs? How are you funding these departments?\nJack Stripling Well, let’s talk specifically about NIL — name, image, and likeness. So you mentioned that athletics departments are contacting you to see if you can help raise money? I just want to make sure I understand.\nRick Singer I’m telling you, the collectives, which are outside of the university’s purview. They work with the university. They work the coaches, but they are an outside group in most cases. Many universities have brought their collectives in-house. But many have not. And their job is to provide sponsorships and opportunities for kids that they are trying to recruit who are high level kids and provide them monies. Now …\nJack Stripling Has anyone from a collective or a university said, Rick Singer, if you can get us money, we will help you get a student admitted to our highly selective institution?\nRick Singer Yes.\nJack Stripling What do you think about that?\nRick Singer What’s funny over the several years that I was involved in my case and then went to camp, the rules of the world have changed. What they’re doing is legal. I think it’s crazy that it’s legal because I got in trouble for what they’re doing.\nJack Stripling You’re saying that you think that a collective outside of the university, saying that we will offer admission to an otherwise unqualified student that Rick Singer represents in exchange for money …\nRick Singer No, the student’s qualified.\nJack Stripling Is legal?\nRick Singer The student is qualified. Why do you keep saying that the student’s not qualified to get in?\nJack Stripling Well, because I’m talking to Rick Singer. At the heart…\nRick Singer But my students. No, no, no. You keep throwing on that my kids weren’t qualified. They are qualified to get into these schools. They’re all qualified because here’s the bottom line. They all graduate. How about the kids who get in and got in for years over affirmative action who weren’t qualified, but they got in because there’s a reason why they got in. How about the kids…\nJack Stripling Understood. But you were representing students, Rick, who would not have been admitted under the traditional course had it not been for acts of bribery\nRick Singer No\nJack Stripling or paying off people at test centers. This is the heart of the case, no?\nRick Singer No, no. First of all, the bribery...\nJack Stripling Why did you have to go through all these hoops if these students would have gotten in otherwise?\nRick Singer Jack, let me ask you a question: Did any university give me my money back? No. Did anybody block me making donations? No. Did universities send me letters, saying, thank you so much for your donation of 500,000. So let me ask you, if I’m getting letters from the university saying, thank you much for your donation, I’m getting kids into school and they’re graduating. The university knows what I’m doing. The university also knows that they’re getting money from other families, that there are thousands of emails running across from admissions, to the president’s offices, to departments, to athletics, stating: This is a VIP family. They are willing to give us money to the university. Let’s make sure that we take care of them. This has been going on forever.\nJack Stripling Rick, I absolutely want to talk to you about what is considered acceptable in college admissions, because I think it’s dizzying and I think you’re making a very good point there. But just as a matter of record, it sounds like you’re saying you never bribed anyone. You pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy. Conspiracy to defraud the United States and obstruction of justice. The conspiracy charges that are associated with these guilty pleas are very much under the umbrella of bribery. I mean I’m looking now …\nRick Singer Hundred percent. But you’re talking about, none of us fought it …\nJack Stripling Well, you’re describing these as donations. That’s not how the government views this.\nRick Singer Well, that’s fine. The government. We spent day after day after day fighting that “donation or bribe,” okay? Their whole point was it was quid pro quo. So I will tell you this. I accepted the fact that I pled guilty and it was called a bribe. They spent, and we all the way to the end, if you notice, I never testified. Why didn’t I testify? Because they were afraid that I was going to call this a donation. When we…\nJack Stripling If you use purported charitable donations from parents, at least in part to bribe two SAT and ACT test administrators, do you not consider that bribery?\nRick Singer That was a payment. That’s not bribery. I’m not bribing somebody to do it. We are doing business with each other. I’m not bribing them. How about all the coaches that are calling me? Am I bribing them when they call me to say, “Can you help me find a donation?” The administrator from X school is calling me saying, “Hey, we need to raise a certain amount of money for our school.” Am I the one bribing them or are they calling me with a business opportunity? You can call it whatever you want at the end of the day. Am I saying what I did on the testing stuff was right? It’s a 100 percent wrong. 100 percent wrong.\nJack Stripling Do you think any of this would have happened absent your presence?\nRick Singer Oh, it’s going on all the time. I’m not, like everybody…\nJack Stirpling No, but this particular conspiracy that we’re talking about, again, quoting the government, “No other defendant’s involvement was as extensive, nor was any co-conspirators conduct more deceptive, corruption more deep-rooted, or lies more pervasive than Singer’s.” Do you agree with that?\nRick Singer Oh, I think there’s lots of people out there that are doing worse than I am.\nJack Stripling Sure.\nRick Singer They made me the poster boy, right, of this whole scenario.\nJack Stripling Stick around, we’ll be back in a minute.\nBREAK\nJack Stripling Rick Singer, as long as I have you here, do you mind if I ask you a little bit about your work with the FBI?\nRick Singer Be my guest.\nJack Stripling You were approached by law enforcement agents in September of 2018, and you agreed to cooperate with the government’s investigation of your co-conspirators. Talk to me about when you were first approached. What happened?\nRick Singer Well, a ruse was committed on my behalf by the coach at Yale, Rudy Meredith, who had called me and who was a co-conspirator, a person who I worked with for years and years, one of many, many coaches who had called me and said, hey, listen, can you come to Boston? And I have some athletic directors and some presidents that want to meet you. And I said, well, who are they? And he told me who they were. And I said well I already have relationships with most of those people. Why do I need to come to Boston? And he said, well, they want to do some other stuff with you. So out of respect, I came to Boston and took the overnight flight, met at a hotel with Rudy. Rudy then took me upstairs into a hotel conference room, a room, and I was supposed to be there with all these people. When I got there, obviously, there were no people in that room. We sat down and I asked him, kind of, where are we with this? And there was a knock on the door, and he had committed a great ruse against me. More power to him and the government. And they knocked on the door, the FBI, the treasury agents came running in with their guns. I sat in the corner with my legs crossed. They grabbed Rudy, they threw him against the wall, which was all pre-planned, handcuffed him and took him outside. And then Charlie’s Angels — the three FBI agents I worked with — and some of the treasury people all came rushing in and said hey you just committed all these crimes. And one of the things they stated was that I bribed all these officials, and I stated for the next three days I didn’t bribe anybody, we collected donations. Immediately upon them coming in the door, they sat down and asked me if I would cooperate. I said well I don’t even know what you have on me. I don’t even know what’s going on. I don’t understand what…\nJack Stripling Were you terrified in this situation, Rick?\nRick Singer No, because I didn’t think I did anything wrong. So…\nJack Stripling Being in a hotel room that’s raided by FBI agents, seeing a guy thrown against a wall in handcuffs that didn’t …\nRick Singer It didn’t it didn’t bother me because I felt, you can ask me whatever you want to ask me, I’m fine. What I didn’t know at the time, until they came in, that they had been wiring my phone for six to eight months before. They had all my emails. They had all my texts for months and months and months and months. And when they sat down and started to ask me questions, they could read back to me exactly transcripts of what I said on all these calls that happened six months before.\nJack Stripling So you’re thinking my goose is cooked at that point?\nRick Singer No. No, I’m not. I’m just…\nJack Stripling OK. You’re still not thinking a crime has been committed?\nRick Singer I’m trying to figure out, what are you trying to get from me? I asked to speak to an attorney. They, of course, tell me we’ll give you an attorney to call. Okay, we’re gonna give you somebody to call. Okay, so give me the number and I’ll call them. Well, what I didn’t know is also that the U.S. Attorney, all bunch of them, were in the room next door to me. And they gave me a phone number to call and I called that federal employee and he didn’t answer. Then I told the FBI, by the way, he didn’t answer. They called him and yelled at him, answer the phone. I called him again. He didn’t answer. So I asked if I could call my own attorney. And at that point I called the best litigator I knew that I worked with. I handled his kids, I worked with his kids. And then he referred me to another attorney because he didn’t handle federal matters. I called that other attorney and ironically, when he got on the phone with me, he started laughing. I told him who I was. And I said, why are you laughing? And he said, do you know who I am? I said absolutely no, I don’t. I just know your name is Don. He goes, I am Don Heller. You worked with both of my kids. You spent years in my home. I know you and what you do intimately. And I appreciate everything that you did for my family. You made an unbelievable, significant difference in my two kids and thank you. Hold on, let me call the U.S. attorney who’s in charge here. And let me ask him where we stand. He had called the U.S. Attorney, Eric Rosen. Eric talked to him. And he called me back and said you are screwed. He said you are the smartest, dumbest person I know. And I said why? He goes because you would not be in this situation had you just picked up the phone and called an attorney, and asked him if what you were doing was kosher. He said you were living in the gray area and the government, they make their own definitions of the gray area. They can make anything into anything they want, and they got you. They’ve been wiring your phone, your emails, they have all your financial records. They know exactly what they’re doing, and based on their definition of quid pro quo and their definition of bribe, they’re going to charge you.\nJack Stripling You had profited handsomely from your activities, and I assume you grew accustomed to a certain lifestyle. I know there’s back and forth about how much money you really made here, but prosecutors say you used $15 million of your client’s money for your own benefit.\nRick Singer Absolutely not.\nJack Stripling When did it sink in for you that life as you knew it was essentially over?\nRick Singer When I got done with that weekend that they made me stay in Boston. But I didn’t profit from that money. That money was not used for me. That money was used to propel what we were doing for the students and the money was being given to the universities. The money was given to the proctors. The money was not given and was not given to me to use for my personal self. It was all money that went out. And I hired an ex-FBI forensics person who actually put all that together and we were never given the opportunity to give that to the DOJ and to the U.S. attorney. They didn’t care. They already started their case and they moved on, and so I had to just move on and accept whatever they’re going to say, they’re gonna say and that’s kind of where we were.\nSo when you keep saying that I cooperated and I accepted all of the charges, that means I accepted it from them, but personally I didn’t accept it.\nJack Stripling I think people have trouble believing this idea that you didn’t profit from this enterprise.\nRick Singer That’s Ok. Everybody is, everybody’s welcome to their own opinion.\nJack Stripling Your lifestyle didn’t change one iota?\nRick Singer No, because the reality, this is a tiny part of my business. We had a….\nJack Stripling Why were you being ordered to pay more than ten million dollars in restitution to the IRS if you hadn’t made money off this?\nRick Singer I’m not being ordered to pay over 10 million to the IRS. I’m actually now in a restoration cause. So let’s talk about this. Two weeks to a month before I was ready to go to camp, we were told that I owed them $10 million.\nJack Stripling That’s what I’m reading from.\nRick Singer Exactly. We said, this is crazy. Where did you come up with that number? You just made up a number.\nJack Stripling So, what is the, just Rick, briefly, what is the status of all of this? I didn’t pull the number out of thin air, as you know. So, do you owe money to the government or not?\nRick Singer Well, I do owe, I owe money to the government.\nJack Stripling And there’s an ongoing dispute about how much?\nRick Singer No, the dispute is over because I had to agree to a $4.7 million restoration. We are still on every paper. including the paper you have, still shows 10 million. We’re waiting for the status of the restoration and the 4.7 million, not 10 million.\nJack Stripling Understood. Thank you for the clarification.\nRick Singer And we still don’t agree with the 4.7. But we had to agree so we can move on, so I could get sentenced and we could move on with my life.\nJack Stripling Are you in money troubles, though?\nRick Singer No.\nJack Stripling You feel financially secure now?\nRick Singer I feel I’m okay.\nJack Stripling So, I want to ask you a little bit about your experience in the prison camp. You were there for 16 months in a prison camp in Pensacola, Florida. It’s a minimum security facility. I’ve heard media reports describe it as cushy. What was your experience like though?\nRick Singer Well I think that media report was back when Barbara Walters did an interview and came to campus and was so surprised that there was a pool there. There were tennis courts there. There was all these things there, and she said, how could this be a prison, right? Let me tell you, there’s no pool there anymore, ok? There are tennis courts. So, my experience was as good as it could be. So when I got there, the first thing I did, I was told that the first thing you need to do is get a great job. So I went through what they call R&D, which is when they take your clothes, they give you your new outfit, they give an ID and all that stuff. And the second I got done, I ran to the fitness center and to the recreation officers and asked for a job. Because I knew the way to make this experience positive was you have to have a job that you didn’t mind going to every day.\nJack Stripling Did you find it to be an unpleasant experience?\nRick Singer No.\nJack Stripling I am curious whether you offered any college consulting advice to anyone in the prison camp.\nRick Singer Actually I offered a lot. There are a lot of gentlemen there that have been in prison for a while and are relatively young folks compared to me. And they have kids at home. They have five-year-old through 18-year-olds. And they would come to me and ask me how they could help their kids be stronger in school and get more opportunities down the road. So what I did do is I worked with a lot of families there where the dads would call the mom or the grandmother, whoever’s taking care of the younger kids, and ask the questions that I needed to know, which was: What was the lexile level of their kids? What was the math level of their kids? And then my family would send from Amazon directly books to their house to do workbooks, that I gave to my own son to do when he was going through the process, to help their kids garner a better foundation and figure out what their kids didn’t know and what they did know so that they had a chance.\nJack Stripling You mentioned your son. I think he was probably in his 20s, I think, when the FBI approached you. Do I have that about right?\nRick Singer I think so.\nJack Stripling I’m curious about conversations you’ve had with him if you’re comfortable talking about it. I’m curious about conversations you’ve had with your family about this.\nRick Singer Well, let me tell you …\nJack Stripling Did you feel the need to ask forgiveness of them?\nRick Singer No. To be frank with you, my family, generations over generations, have been involved with the FBI for years. And they already think the FBI is despicable. They have been involved with lots of things that have been turned around on our family, and other things that happened. So, they don’t believe half the stuff that goes on, and they do know that the FBI and the U.S. Attorneys do whatever they want to do. You pretty much have no chance when you have to deal with the DOJ. So you either accept what they’re going to provide to you, and that’s why I accepted the cooperation, or you fight them and you get a worse penalty. I will tell you of people in my camp that went to court and were offered a plea deal and got six to 10 years extra because they fought it.\nJack Stripling You may not agree with the government’s complete case. I understand that. But you have accepted responsibility for your role in this.\nRick Singer 100 percent.\nJack Stripling And you have told me on multiple occasions today that you know what you did was wrong.\nRick Singer 100 percent.\nJack Stripling I’m curious about being in a high profile situation that is potentially embarrassing, whether you had difficult conversations at all with your family about that.\nRick Singer They’re not difficult conversations. You make them difficult. I don’t make them difficult. We’re having conversations as a family would. Not every conversation is happy-go-lucky, and not every conversation is pleasant. When you talk about reality, I took full responsibility. There is nothing that the government said I did — the actual of doing the things I did — I did everything that they said that I did. You can define it differently than I do, but I did every single thing they said.\nJack Stripling I think this is a complicated way of me asking if you ever felt shame.\nRick Singer Oh I feel shame all the time, because I feel bad that my family’s name had to be involved. I feel terrible that my son, at the time when he was graduating school and finishing seminary, that he had to be thrown into this. So I feel disappointment in myself. Shame, not maybe the shame that you think of, but just shame that I was stupid. I could have stopped all of this, all of it, by getting the appropriate advice from counsel. Listen, it was my fault. And all I had to do was call an attorney and the attorney could have said to me, whoa what you’re doing is wrong.\nJack Stripling Am I wrong to be worried though, Rick? Because you’re still getting up at four o’clock in the morning, you’ve done more by 6 a.m than I’ll probably do today. You said you were taking 20-30 calls about NIL, this sort of thing. A person might hear this and think, Rick’s gonna get into this same stuff again.\nRick Singer Actually, I’m a lot smarter so...\nJack Stripling There’s gonna be another gray area …\nRick Singer No, there’s gonna be no gray area. There’s gonna be black and white. Because my first call is always to an attorney. My first thought is I only want to live in black and white. If it’s not black and it’s not white and it is not for certain, I’m going to find out the truth. Do parents want to work with me? Should they want to work with me? Just know this. I am going to do everything I possibly can for my families that is lawful. I am not going to break the rules. I am not going to do anything that counsel doesn’t say is absolutely black and white.\nJack Stripling Well look, I really appreciate you taking time to talk to us about all of this. And your candor and your time are so appreciated. Thank you so much.\nRick Singer And I appreciate you.\nJack Stripling After our interview with Rick Singer, we contacted the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts, and we asked about any ongoing negotiations over what Mr. Singer owes the government. Without elaboration, a spokeswoman for the office wrote in an email, “As it stands, Mr. Singer has an outstanding $10 million judgment.”\nJack Stripling This is the last episode of Season 2, so you won’t see new episodes in our feed for a few weeks.

Ron DeSantis, a Republican, installed a slate of conservative members to its governing board, New College of Florida has seen transformations large and small. In some of the first shots of what became a wider war on “woke” education, New College’s trustees ditched gender studies, endorsed a curriculum focused on the Western canon, and made the Sarasota, Fla. campus inhospitable to some faculty and students. New College is more appealing now to jocks, and it’s flush with money appropriated by Florida’s Republican-controlled Legislature. But what does all this mean for the quirky institution that had long been known as “Barefoot U.”?\nListen\nRelated Reading:\nThe College That Conservatives Took Over (The Chronicle)\nA Professor at New College Quits in Dramatic Fashion.

Please email us at collegematters@chronicle.com if you have any questions.\nJack Stripling This is College Matters from The Chronicle.\nEmma Pettit Many of the professors there are really concerned about the leadership’s approach towards hiring, towards the curriculum, towards everything that faculty really care about. I think that they feel like those decisions are just being made without them or without as much input as they had in the past.\nJack Stripling For a few weeks in early 2023, a small liberal arts college in Sarasota, Fla. felt like the epicenter of higher education’s culture wars. In a decisive move, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis appointed six conservative members to the New College of Florida Board of Trustees. The action was widely seen as a Republican takeover of a small public college, establishing a conservative beachhead where DEI and gender studies were no longer welcome. Chris Rufo, a conservative activist who was among the new appointees, described the plan as nothing short of an invasion, aimed at obliterating what he termed “woke nihilism.” “We are now over the walls,” Rufo posted on Twitter at the time, “and ready to transform higher education from within.” More than two years later, the story of New College has faded from national news. President Donald Trump has picked much bigger fights with higher-profile institutions, like Columbia and Harvard universities. But our Chronicle of Higher Education colleague, Emma Pettit, was curious to find out how the New College experiment is going now. In a deeply reported article, Emma dug into what’s unfolded at an institution that, not long ago, conservatives promised to transform.\nWell, Emma, welcome to College Matters.\nEmma Pettit Thanks for having me.\nJack Stripling Emma, you’ve done a lot of reporting of late on New College of Florida. What were you hoping to figure out?\nEmma Pettit I was really interested in New College because of a couple of reasons. I’m interested in how big contentious ideas about society and culture and education, how that gets kind of refracted onto college campuses. And New College sits squarely at this huge debate over if social justice commitments in DEI has gone too far and if colleges should be able to govern themselves, even if that results in some very far left or liberal culture. And when should a governor step in and to what degree should the governor or politicians bring their will upon higher education? Pretty pressing ideas and pretty pressing questions. I was interested in New College specifically because when Ron DeSantis announced the new trustees, there were two big narratives that happened. Supporters of the move saw it as this first battle in this grand recapturing of higher education from progressive academe, which they think has run amok for the past however many decades. Critics of the move saw New College as this jewel of an institution that would be callously destroyed by people who didn’t care about it. And as a rule, I’m skeptical of big narratives, or I’m skeptical of easy narratives. And I wanted to know for myself, what happens. What happens when you try to transform and take over a college?\nJack Stripling You’ve mentioned that New College had this sort of liberal reputation in terms of its campus politics. What was the college best known for prior to 2023 when it really entered the national news?\nEmma Pettit Culturally, it was known as what’s called a barefoot university, literally and metaphorically. So kids walking around barefoot and also a granola, crunchy, hippie, welcoming to drugs and exploration of identities and all the stuff that comes with that. You know, they had a mascot for a long time that was the stray dog that just appeared on campus. So it was a pretty quirky place. Its academics were also unique. So students who went there, there were no letter grades. Instead, professors gave personalized narrative evaluations of every student. Students also would agree to contracts at the beginning of every semester about what they’d learn, what they achieve. And failure, the freedom to fail, was kind of baked into the academic programming there. So it was very unique, both culturally and academically. It was small. It’s tiny. Its first president always wanted the campus to reach 1,200 students, and it’s not come close to that. Before the board overhaul, I think it was at under 700 students. So we’re talking about a tiny, lefty, granola crunchy campus.\nJack Stripling And they wouldn’t really dispute that characterization necessarily? Is that your sense?\nEmma Pettit Yeah, yeah, I think they would embrace it. I think that New College students and professors, I don’t wanna give the impression that everyone thinks the same way. That’s not true at all. There is an iconoclastic and kind of defiant streak. But it’s a place where if you were known as the quote unquote weird kid at your high school, you could go to New College and be in the mainstream there. It was where the counterculture was the culture.\nJack Stripling I think I’m starting to understand. So, in reporting this story, you recently visited the campus in Sarasota, Florida. What stood out to you about it?\nEmma Pettit One thing that really stood out to me when I went on this golf cart ride with Nate March, who’s the communications director there, was how much has changed. We passed construction equipment and a fire pit and freshly painted buildings and signage and beach volleyball courts that at that point in time were halfway through construction. The pace of change is pretty remarkable. That also stood out me when I spoke with Andy Trinh, who’s a student there and one of two student archivists who oversees a collection of things that students save that are related to the student body and student culture there. And Andy showed me this room where all these vestiges of the past were being stored. These huge paintings that were done by students that were vibrant and weird and interesting to look at and a little ugly. And I, on the one hand, understand why maybe they would not be anyone’s first choice to hang on a wall. And yet I loved them because they were so unique and they were part of what made the campus special. Those were all in storage at this point because they’d been taken down.\nJack Stripling Are they being taken down because the administration is taking them down?\nEmma Pettit That’s what my impression was. Basically what Andy and the other archivists do, they hear about a space that’s undergoing renovation through the grapevine, nothing really official. And they go and try and save relevant items. So paintings done by students would be totally relevant items that they want to save and then catalog and those I think they might even be trying to return to alumni.\nJack Stripling So as progress marches on at New College, some of the quirky things that students did are starting to disappear?\nEmma Pettit Yeah, yeah. And I, as a lover of quirk, I mourn that, you know? It was really interesting to be in this archive with Andy and to see, you know, paraphernalia from student protests in the past and signs, banners, that sort of thing — things that, you know you might think, oh, this just gets thrown away or tossed out once the day is done. But those really matter to student culture, those really matter to students like Andy, who are pretty connected to the old version of New College. It was really interesting to just be in this space where all those things were kind of shoved into one room because the campus is undergoing so much change.\nJack Stripling And this was a place that kind of prided itself on not having many rules. Are there more rules now at New College?\nEmma Pettit That’s a good question. I don’t know if I could say that there are more rules, but the rules have changed and who decides them, I think, has changed. So, New College had a pretty strong history of self-governance. And what I mean by that is the student body and the student government was really active and they would have parties and they’d vote on themes of the parties before having them. And they had a really active role in student life. I think that professors who were there at this really small campus — I know I keep saying that, but like really small — so every professor had a pretty active role on committees and in kind of steering the ship of the college. Now, with the new president, Richard Corcoran, he comes from a background of, I think, top-down leadership. He is a very prominent Republican politician in Florida. He was the former Speaker of the House and he comes from this environment where, you know, rules are made at the top or by the decision makers, like that’s why they’re brought in. And I think that that is a very different culture than what New College had in the past.\nJack Stripling And some of the rules I think you did report on was that you gotta wear shoes in the cafeteria now.\nEmma Pettit Yeah, yeah.\nJack Stripling You can’t necessarily hang things in your dorm room window. So there is some evidence of this beyond the broad governance changes that you might be alluding to.\nEmma Pettit Yes, for sure. It was interesting. In the dining hall, I think in a natural sciences building, I saw signs that shoes are required. Now, one can easily make the argument from a food safety and lab safety point of view that, you know, we should put on some shoes when we go into these spaces. But I was walking out of the dining Hall and I did see one student who looked to me like a former New College student or how should I say it?\nJack Stripling Veteran of New College?\nEmma Pettit Yes, a student who looked like a veteran of New College, completely barefoot, sitting on a couch, and I thought, rock on, fight the power. But no, I do, and I should say I understand some of these rule changes and I’m sure that the university would say that things had gotten really lax, and I think they justify a lot of their decisions through student safety and common sense. I think that they would argue that some things had kind of gone ignored for a long time.\nJack Stripling I did some reporting on New College when this first happened, but I haven’t revisited the campus in the way that you have, certainly. I know people seemed upset about coming changes, but now some of these changes have happened, and I’m wondering, are people upset about the changes that are occurring?\nEmma Pettit Yeah, people are still upset about the changes that are occurring, but it’s an interesting thing. You know, the takeover happened, the board overhaul happened in January of 2023. There was a huge amount of protest and anger and sometimes I think overstatement or there were comparisons made to Nazi Germany that I think are unhelpful and unwise. But there was a huge amount of anger and protest at the beginning. And what happens over time is just, you cannot raise your fist for so long because you get tired, you know? And people leave, the people who, the students and the faculty who I think were the most opposed left. You know, they took new jobs or they enrolled somewhere else. And I was interested really in the people who remain and why they chose to do that. And I think there’s a range of opinions about everything that’s happened since.\nJack Stripling One of the narratives you said you kind of wanted to interrogate was this idea that this was a sort of liberal utopia where anybody could have any opinion and it was very open. I’m curious what your reporting showed you about that particular narrative.\nEmma Pettit Right. So I was curious about that because it’s a really small campus. It’s a campus that attracted students who leaned left, certainly, who were pretty, I think even more than leaned were pretty far to the left. And it just stands to reason to me that if you have a really small group of students, you give students a ton of autonomy and they are politically like-minded or interested in a certain set of social justice ideas, it makes sense to me that there would be some censoring, some group think, some ideological conformity there. And what was interesting is going back and looking at a survey, a couple of surveys of students and also concerns that New College leaders had raised during the 2010s about why are students dropping out, and one concern that they raised was student culture, was people not being able to find an in-group, people feeling ostracized for their beliefs or their ideas. There was a 2017 survey of students, faculty, and staff. And on that survey, a third of participating students said that they’d seriously consider leaving due to campus climate issues, including the feeling that the college was an echo chamber. And I’ll just read one comment from a respondent on that survey, that says, “Several people I know of left New College because of aggressive students who publicly called them out or humiliated them, mostly online, for saying something in disagreement with their personal beliefs.” So this was a real problem. And I think it does no one any good by downplaying that as a real issue that college leaders at New College at the time before 2023 were trying to solve.\nJack Stripling You mentioned New College veterans, but I’m curious, we’re at this interesting point in the life of the college where you have folks who were there before this big change happened on the board and folks who have come after. I’m curious whether there’s tensions among those students in particular.\nEmma Pettit I didn’t see tension among the students, but I definitely saw what I’d call an oil and water type dynamic. Walking around campus, it’s pretty clear who came before the board overhaul or who at least enrolled because they were attracted to the old New College and who’s a new student. And that’s pretty clear because a lot of the new students are athletes. So the college instituted an athletics program as an enrollment driver and because they thought sports would be good for the college. And so walking around, if you see a student who is wearing darker clothes, maybe with a couple of piercings, maybe with more of an alternative look, that is a Novo, or a student who was there before the board overhaul or who’s invested in the kind of the old version of New College. And if you see someone walking around in leggings, a ponytail, maybe a gold cross necklace, that’s a Banyan or someone who’s nicknamed after the Mighty Banyan mascot, which is what the mascot changed to under Corcoran, the president there. So I did not see like tension. It’s not like we had dueling factions of students. And the students are all in classes together and I’m sure friendships have been forged. But I talked with a baseball player in the dining hall who made it really clear, I only hang out with other baseball players. And I talked with another student named Braedan in the dining hall who made it pretty clear, I don’t really hang out with anyone because a lot of his friends graduated or left after January of 2023.\nJack Stripling So, remind us, what was this new board promising? What was the agenda they were bringing forward? And how have they gone about making changes in service to that agenda?\nEmma Pettit So the new board has seemed largely in agreement, at least in how they vote with New College’s future. The most prominent member, Chris Rufo, promised in an interview that the college would become a haven for conservative families and a place that reflected their values. Other board members, I think, have said that they want to build on what was already great about New College. They’ve not struck as much of a political tone. Early on, the board fired the president there, Pat Okker, who was an English professor for a long time, who’d risen through the ranks of academe, had a very traditional background for the president of a liberal arts college. They replaced her with Richard Corcoran, who is a long-time Florida politician. He was education commissioner under DeSantis during the Covid-19 pandemic. He is a former Republican speaker of the house. He was known as a very formidable politician. Someone who got his way and who was able to make things happen in the legislature. And yeah, he doesn’t have the typical background that you would expect from a liberal arts college president. He thinks that’s a good thing. He thinks that he’s bringing a lot of other skills to the campus. The board has also endorsed and voted on a curriculum, a gen ed curriculum, that focuses on the Western canon, these principles of logos and techne. They did away with the gender studies program. But other than the curriculum, those were some of the flashier moves that happened within the first eight months or so. So they’ve done some things with curriculum, they’ve done some things with leadership. My sense is the day to day is really guided by Richard Corcoran, the president. But I think the goal more broadly is to make the school more appealing to families that have students in charter schools, homeschools, religious academies, places where I think it’s safe to say the former New College wasn’t really maybe looking for students and that’s like more appealing to conservative or moderate families. But building that type of recruitment and establishing those pipelines, I think that that’s something that takes a really long time, like establishing and embedding a new curriculum, that’s a long-term project. One interesting and surprising thing that’s happened more in the short term has been the focus on athletics. And very shortly after Richard Corcoran was made the interim president, the college announced that it would create an athletics department. I think they list something like 17 or 18 sports on their website now. And that has been a huge push and change both culturally and just in priority. And you can see it on the physical campus. I mean, I walked past batting cages. I could hear the crack of the bats whenever I was on campus doing interviews. You can see the sand volleyball courts. There’s a grass field. So yeah, that’s been a huge, huge focus.\nJack Stripling And this might’ve been a place that a young person who wasn’t particularly jock-y would feel welcome. And now we’ve got this critical mass of athletes as part of this enrollment strategy, as you mentioned. Doing away with gender studies, emphasizing Western civilization. You get rid of an English professor as president, put in a politician. There’s a broad suite of changes here that seem quite interesting and intentional. I am curious though about the faculty. We know that some of them left when these changes happened. Is this a place that’s now just stacked with conservative professors?\nEmma Pettit So I wouldn’t say that, or actually, I should say, I don’t know that. So unfortunately, I don’t have a lot of data about the shifts in the faculty numbers and the departments in which they were hired and the focus of those departments. So it’s been reported that of the roughly 100 faculty between the spring of 2023 and the fall, 36 professors retired, resigned, or they took leave. And that that leave might not have been permanent. So we don’t know exactly how many permanently left, but a chunk of them did. And for a college that has, you know, a hundred or less faculty members, that’s a huge number and that’s a huge change in culture. And I believe that the college announced last fall that it hired around 40 faculty members. Some of those are not permanent hires. Some of them I think are visiting presidential scholars in residence. But still, that’s a huge sea change. So you’ve got these newcomers, you’ve got this old guard, and that in itself is a culture clash. So we know of at least one professor who’s gotten some attention, Bruce Gilley, who’s a political scientist. He is known maybe to your audience for some backlash to an article that he wrote, “The Case for Colonialism.” And he was hired as a visiting presidential scholar in residence. And he wrote an essay for The American Conservative about his excitement to join the New College “Reconquista,” as he terms it. So he’s really invested in the project and the grander, I guess, political aims of the project. But it also stands to reason that people who are joining the New College faculty maybe aren’t as committed, you know, it’s a tough hiring market. Sarasota is beautiful. You know it’d be nice to work at a liberal arts college. I don’t think we can really conclude that all the new faculty are completely on board or as, I guess, enthusiastic as Professor Gilley is, but it stands to reason that they’re generally more comfortable with the college tacking away from DEI commitments and more towards the Western canon.\nJack Stripling You mentioned that some professors have left. One of those departures happened in a rather dramatic fashion. In 2023, the faculty chairman, Matthew Lepinski, announced that he was leaving after a contentious board meeting. We have a clip of that moment, which is pretty striking. Let’s hear some of that:\nMatthew Lepinski So thank you, all of you. I’m very concerned about the direction that this board is going and the destabilization of the academic program. And so I wish you the best of luck, but this is my last board meeting. I’m leaving the college.\nBoard speaker Uh meeting’s, meeting’s adjourned. Thank you.\nJack Stripling As college trustee meetings go, that qualifies as a pretty dramatic moment. There’s a video of the meeting and Dr. Lepinski, who was an ex-officio member of the board, rather abruptly gathers his things and walks out of the meetings. He’s stone-faced and determined. Did you get a sense that there are many faculty remaining like Lepinski who harbor serious concerns about where the college is headed? Or are people falling in line now?\nEmma Pettit Yeah, I think there are people who do harbor serious concerns. I think those that do think that New College has a really unique academic programming — the no letter grades, and the narrative evaluations, and the things they love about the college they see at risk and completely threatened by this new leadership. So I’ve seen an interesting split, you know, some professors that remain totally lean out and want nothing to do with the new administration. And they keep their head down. Some professors, I think, fight against the new direction in ways that they can and try and work, I guess, collaboratively, but try and steer things towards what they think is best for New College, which is a lot of times away from what the leadership wants. And then there are some professors who’ve leaned into it, who think that the new leadership is not a sign of terrible things, but is maybe just the result of New College’s own failures. And one of those professors who’s in that latter category is a guy by the name of David Allen Harvey. So he’s a history professor. I met with him in his office. He was the chair of the faculty at one point in time. And he told me that his approach to all of this was pragmatic. He seemed like a practical guy. And he explained that he made his career at New College. He didn’t want to see the place fail. It also helps that he studies the history of modern France and Germany, so kind of fits into the focus on the West that leadership wants. And he’s now dean of the Great Books Program. And he differs from his colleagues in several ways. He basically thinks that the board changes and the new administration is not something to be resisted and is not just like a situation to tolerate, but he called it something of a lifeline. You know, he explained to me that lawmakers who’d once considered shuttering New College or rather it being, you know, merged with a larger university, they are now awarding gobs of money to the college, you know, to become better and to fulfill this mission of becoming one of the best liberal arts colleges in the country. And the reason for that, he said, is because the legislature and the governor support Richard Corcoran’s mission. They support the president’s mission. We couldn’t have one without the other. So that’s his perspective. I spoke with a lot of faculty members who feel very differently. One of them is Magdalena Carrasco. She’s an art history professor who arrived at New College in 1977. And she named Harvey as someone that she kind of considers essentially a turncoat or someone who’s turned against his own colleagues. She expressed strong skepticism that the idea of collaborating with New College’s new leaders would lead to anything good. She told me that what that does is you help normalize what is extraordinary behavior on their part, you make it possible and make it seem reasonable. And I spoke with a lot of faculty members for this story. I think a lot them would agree with parts of what Carrasco said. They also might agree with part of what Harvey said, but I think that many of the professors there are really concerned about the leadership’s approach towards hiring, towards the curriculum, towards everything that faculty really care about. I think that they feel like those decisions are just being made without them or without as much input as they had in the past. And I think they think the things that they think make New College special are really under threat, and time will tell whether those things eventually kind of break over time.\nJack Stripling Stick around, we’ll be back in a minute.\nBREAK\nJack Stripling So I am curious about the leadership. We’ve talked about Richard Corcoran, his background as a player in Republican politics in the state of Florida. Did you have a chance to talk to him when you were down in Sarasota?\nEmma Pettit Kind of. So yeah, I really wanted to speak with him. I was really curious what he would say about the college’s priorities, just how things were going so far if they aligned with his vision. He also came out with a book very conveniently the month that I was visiting, Storming the Ivory Tower. It is dedicated to mainstream media and their hubris. So I was interested in how he would approach me as like a journalist for a mainstream outlet. So we met at a cocktail reception for faculty. I was told that we would get some time there. When I approached him, he unfortunately redirected me to the communications director and I asked if we could talk again. And then he said that, you know, me and my news outlet had published like 10 inaccurate stories about New College and I asked to talk about the inaccuracies. And I started to pull the phone out of my pocket and he said that we were off the record. Which is not how that works. And I said, we’re on the record and I was doing my job. And he said that if we’re on the record then he had no comment and keep doing a great job was his, I guess, parting words there. So yeah, it did not go as well as I’d hoped.\nJack Stripling Sounds a little prickly.\nEmma Pettit He had been described to me before that interaction as someone who could be prickly, someone who can be defensive, but also someone who would be charming and someone who could be funny. So I kind of thought that I had coordinated this whole visit with the communications department. I’d made very clear that I wanted to interview the president. I had gotten access to other people on campus that were part of the administration. I thought that I would be met with the more charming side, but I was not. And then a little bit later, though, we spoke again briefly. This time I was in the auditorium before an event and he was walking by me and stopped to talk, and he asked if I’d conducted any good interviews outside, and I said I had, and he said, just not with me. And I said, I’d still love to. But that unfortunately did not persuade him. But yeah, we had a nice exchange. He asked me my name, and he told me, you know, I’m Richard, by the way. And then he walked off. So, you know I think I saw two different sides of him in the span of like an hour, which as a reporter, you know, if you’re not gonna give me an interview, you know you might as well do that.\nJack Stripling Well, and as you say, he’s sort of positioned himself as anti-media. The subtitle of his book is How a Florida College Became Ground Zero in the Struggle to Take Back Our Campuses. So he has fully embraced this idea of sort of storming higher education, taking it back from the woke left. He’s not running away from that image, it doesn’t sound like.\nEmma Pettit No. No, no, no. And so much of the subplot of that book or the I guess the plot of that book is the media, and is the critical posture that they adopted towards the New College transformation, which is true. Like news outlets were very, very critical, skeptical, and I think looking for, you know, evidence of things going wrong. I mean, we work in newsrooms, like things going wrong is a better headline than like, things going medium or things going boring. So I get it. And he also, in his book, had a couple of examples where I thought, yeah, I think that’s unfair framing. Or I think there were some questions that were not asked that should have been. So I wanted to talk with him about it because I like getting a little meta. Like, tell me what we collectively, the media, has gotten wrong about New College. But unfortunately, I didn’t get the chance to do that.\nJack Stripling Yeah, and what was happening, I think what made it newsworthy in part, was the degree to which the people involved in it were saying the quiet part out loud. There was no gray area about what the folks coming in here were trying to do, their narrative that the college was broken, and that part of the reason that it was broken was because of its politics. Do you agree with that?\nEmma Pettit I think that that is completely the outward posture and some of the outward messaging. I mean, there were these, in the story, these talking points that were circulated by the governor’s office that basically say, this was a campus run amok or destroyed by its own social justice commitments, and that’s why it couldn’t get the enrollment that it wanted, and that’s why it was slipping and it had all these issues. And New College did have issues; it totally did, and it had issues with some of the student culture stuff. I think for people who are on campus, it was pretty difficult to hear just like, you are a failure over and over and over again, and to be kind of drafted as these like soldiers in a culture war that they did not ask for.\nThat being said, I think the internal rhetoric sometimes differed from the outward rhetoric, right? You know, it’s one thing to talk about wokeism run amok and this college kind of being a failure, or we want to storm the ivory tower. But you actually got to work with all the people who are still there. And you know, I think sometimes internally the messaging was, hey, we, uh, want to build on what you guys are already doing well here. One really interesting person that I spoke with was Bruce Abramson, who has a new title now, but at the time was the executive director of new students and graduate admissions. And he’s a critic of progressive academia or what he sees as the excesses of progressive academia. But he was complimentary of some of the professors that he’d met at New College. He thinks the place has an incredible skeleton. Like he seems like someone who got onto campus and saw a lot of good things going on there, you know? It just shows that like your narratives can become complicated when you actually meet people and you talk to the people who’ve been invested in this campus for decades.\nJack Stripling Right, right. I think that that’s a really good point about how the hot outward rhetoric and the actual work of governing within an institution often differ. I do think another thing that raised eyebrows was that people who were supporting this action were saying, we want this to be the next Hillsdale College. This is a private conservative Christian liberal arts college in Hillsdale, Michigan, that’s famous for not accepting any federal money. So the idea that you’re going to take a public liberal arts college and turn it into something that looks a lot like a private Christian college, I think for some people was anathema.\nEmma Pettit Right. So Corcoran takes issue with how the news media ran with that Hillsdale comparison, but it didn’t come out of thin air and it wasn’t just reporters who were saying it. James Uthmeyer, who was then Ron DeSantis’ chief of staff and is now Florida’s attorney general, made that comparison. He told The Daily Caller that the administration wanted New College to be something like “the Hillsdale of the South.” And other officials ran with it too, including Florida’s education commissioner and the governor’s communications director. All that said, Corcoran blames the media for inferring that these Hillsdale comparisons meant that the governor had designs to make New College into a conservative Christian institution. In his book, he says that if reporters had, quote, “bothered to follow up with the people who made these comparisons, they would have known that the goal was only to establish a great liberal arts institution.” But, you know, you’re choosing Hillsdale for a reason. If you meant classical liberal arts college, you could have said something like St. John’s. It was meant to make a point.\nJack Stripling I’m curious about the report card so far. We’ve got a couple years into this experiment. The biggest argument that New College was broken had to do with its enrollment. They couldn’t make that number budge in a meaningful way, and conservatives would say that that was because of the politics. We’ve talked about that. But is there any evidence that this new group of leaders have turned things around in the past two years, relative to enrollment specifically?\nEmma Pettit There is. The latest, I guess, federal data is from the fall of 2023. New College then had 732 students, which was up from the previous year, pre-board overhaul at 690. A couple of things to know, a ton of students left. I think around a quarter didn’t come back between the two falls, you know, pre- and post-takeover, but they went from, yeah, 690 to 732. So that’s about a 6% increase. And then we don’t have federal reported data for the fall of 2024, but at the start of the most recent academic year, the college said in a press release that it had surpassed 850 students. So yeah, that’s an upward swing.\nJack Stripling But far short of where they say they want to end up. What’s the broader goal?\nEmma Pettit Yeah, so they’ve staked out goals for themselves. I think right now they would say that they’re on the pathway to hit their goals. They have a goal of 1,800 students by 2034. I, a higher education reporter, not someone who works in enrollment, but just as an observer, would call that ambitious. I would call it that incredibly ambitious for a college that has never approached 1,200 students. 1,200 was the magic number that its first president wanted and New College hasn’t come close to that. If you’re trying to get 1,800 students on a campus that is a residential liberal arts college that is going to be a massive transformation.\nJack Stripling And part of how you do that is with money from the state or money from donors. I know that there’s a critique out there that the money really started flowing once they got their board in place, once there was ideological conformity, that’s the narrative you hear that, oh, now the legislature likes New College. They had gotten some opportunities before. They’d gotten some money before to try to turn things around. But is the spigot just fully open now?\nEmma Pettit Yeah, they’d certainly gotten some money towards this plan to boost enrollment back in I want to say 2017. The amount of money they’re getting now totally depends on when you count, how you count, all that boring stuff. But it is I think fair to say hand in fist more than they were getting pre Richard Corcoran before this takeover happened.\nJack Stripling So, the New College story felt significant at the time of the board takeover for a few reasons. Ron DeSantis, people may not remember this, but was an ascendant figure in the Republican Party at the time. He was widely seen as a legitimate rival to Trump for the party’s presidential nomination. A lot’s changed since then. But what’s happening at New College was sort of the centerpiece of DeSantis’ anti-woke agenda. Now the idea of stacking a small college board with conservatives might feel kind of quaint as a broader anti-woke action. The Trump administration is forcing colleges as powerful as Columbia University to do what it wants. There’s enormous federal pressure to root out DEI at colleges all over the country. Within that broader context, why does the New College story still matter?\nEmma Pettit Yeah, I certainly get what you’re saying. I mean, looking at the past 100 days or so, it’s like, my God, I don’t know if we could have predicted the way that the Trump administration is trying to bring higher education to heel. I think it still matters for a couple reasons. I think it still matters because the ideas that animate the changes at New College are the ones that animate the Trump administration, right? It’s the idea that universities and colleges have become completely captured by Democrats, by progressives, by people who are very, very opposed to conservative ideas and to conservatives in general, and that that has been allowed to take place for so long and there needs to be a huge recapturing of higher education writ large. And there’s arguments that, you know, woke ideas, DEI, social justice issues, et cetera, have corrupted the mission of these institutions, have made them focus not on, you know academic excellence and merit, but on these fuzzy, squishy discriminatory practices and priorities that are doing a disservice to the country. That’s the argument. That’s the argument that you find at New College. That’s the argument that you find and the federal government right now. So I think it really, really matters to understand. Hey, here’s one campus that was thrust to the center of these clashing ideas. How are things going? And I think that the answer to that question I think is complicated. And I hope will complicate readers’ perspectives and maybe expectations of what’s happened.\nJack Stripling So certainly a canary in the coal mine, in terms of where higher education might be headed. But also an interesting story in and of itself. I’m so glad you looked into it, Emma. It’s fascinating.\nEmma Pettit Yeah, thanks so much.

It’s a student satisfaction survey. Students are basically telling you: Did I like my professor?\nJack Stripling Toward the end of a college semester, the tables get turned. Students who have been graded and critiqued for months finally get a chance to let professors and their colleges know how they felt about a class. The teaching evaluation, as it’s commonly known, is a time-honored tradition in higher education. It’s an opportunity for students to gush about the inspiring professors who have changed their lives or to exact some small justice on the disorganized blowhards who have made classes miserable. As it turns out, a lot of college instructors hate these evaluations and question how they’re used at colleges. To talk about why, I’ve invited Beckie Supiano back to College Matters. Beckie is a senior writer at The Chronicle of Higher Education, where she writes about teaching and learning. She’s also co-author of The Chronicle‘s popular teaching newsletter. We’ll add a link in our show notes where you can subscribe.\nBeckie, welcome to the show.\nBeckie Supiano Thanks so much, Jack.\nJack Stripling Well, let’s start simply. What are teaching evaluations and how are they being used on college campuses today?\nBeckie Supiano Okay, so near the end of the semester, students get a survey that they’re completing about the course and the instructor. These vary a lot. Back in the day, when you and I were in college, we would have filled these out in the classroom. The professor would probably leave the room, hand them out on paper. These days, they’re done online. Students are asked a number of questions. They will vary some from campus to campus, but a combination of some free response, short answer, and they might also be asked to give a numerical rating, say on a one to five scale, both of the course and of the instructor.\nJack Stripling How do people feel about this? How do teachers feel about them?\nBeckie Supiano Yeah, so I think to answer that, let me just back up a little bit and talk about how these things are used. So the original idea, as I understand it, was that this is a way to get feedback from students to improve instruction. The professors would hear directly from their students in an anonymized, after the course is done, kind of a way about what worked and what didn’t. I think, you know, that’s hard to argue against. Getting feedback can be really valuable. The thing is, that’s not the only way these are used. On some campuses, some portion of students’ responses is available to students who might want to take this course in the future. When you’re registering for the next term, you can see feedback from students who’ve taken a course before. But the main thing, and the reason these are so controversial, is that they’re often relied on pretty heavily in performance evaluations for faculty. So when a college is trying to determine if someone did a good job as a teacher, this is often the main and sometimes the only source of data on whether someone’s a good teacher or not. And that’s where it gets really messy.\nJack Stripling Huh, so this isn’t just some perfunctory task that students are doing. It actually might affect whether a professor gets promoted or gets a merit raise, that type of thing?\nBeckie Supiano Yeah, absolutely. So this is something that is sort of a hurdle for someone on the tenure track who, you know, needs to show that they’re a good enough teacher to stick around on campus. And also for the majority of instructors who are adjuncts, they’re really only being evaluated on their teaching. So a lot can really ride on this number. You know, someone might be averaging the one to five rating that students have given a professor, and then that’s it, you know, or close to it. It’s the seemingly objective information on if someone is good at this part of their job or again, in the case of someone who’s contingent, kind of their whole job.\nJack Stripling I don’t think I realized I had this level of power, Beckie, when I was a college student. I might go back and write some of these.\nBeckie Supiano Honestly, I don’t think students often know how these surveys are used or how they’re supposed to think about filling them out. Some colleges have tried to provide students with a better sense of what the surveys are used for and what kind of feedback is valuable. I mean, I don’t think I would have known about that when I was an undergraduate either, how would you?\nJack Stripling So professors might be leery of them, even though they want the feedback perhaps, they might be leery of how they might be used. What’s the general consensus among professors about teaching evaluations?\nBeckie Supiano It’s hard to find someone who’s like a stalwart defender of using student course evaluations as the primary or sole measure of teaching quality. I think that’s pretty hard to defend. There are a bunch of problems with these, right? So some of the problems with course evaluations are just about the questions students are being asked. I think most people could agree, students are in a position to tell you some things about the course and the instructor. After all, they hopefully came to class and experienced it. And unlike anyone else, they were in the room, day after day, week after week. They can give you feedback on what this person did and how the course was organized. And if the assignments matched what was described in the syllabus and had something to do with what they were later asked to apply on an exam. Great. But students are asked about lots of other things too on some of these colleges’ survey forms and sometimes things that they might not really be in a position to speak to, like is this professor a fair grader? I mean you probably have an opinion on if your own work was evaluated in a way that you liked, but that’s different from being fair because you have no idea how they graded anyone else in all likelihood and so how could you know that? Or a student might be asked about the professor’s expertise; they probably don’t really know how to evaluate that. And then there’s some questions that just really don’t pertain to anything that you’d want to evaluate looking at teaching. Like I’ve seen a question about if someone’s enthusiastic. I mean, that’s really subjective, but it also might not actually have anything to do with learning, which is ostensibly the outcome the colleges are going for here. So there’s some questions about that. What do these answers actually get you? And the sort of broad understanding among many professors is it’s a popularity contest. It’s a student satisfaction survey. Students are basically telling you, did I like my professor? That might matter. But I’m not sure anyone would say that should be the main quality that keeps someone employed on a campus is if students like them or not because students might like a professor for really great reasons or really superficial or even detrimental reasons, right? Like, oh, this professor just, you know, let us do whatever we wanted and was a really light grader and let us just kind of go off topic in our discussion and, you know, do whatever we kind of wanted in class. That might not be the most desirable outcome long term for students or for the college.\nJack Stripling If that were the case, it does seem like there are things that professors could do to sort of game the system. If this is a popularity contest, it might affect how you teach the course.\nBeckie Supiano In big and small ways that can be an issue, right? I mean, I think professors kind of understand that this is what’s happening. And so they might feel pressured to be flexible, to be responsive. Now, that’s not necessarily all bad. Students are receptive to professors treating them like people. And I think that’s probably for the best. But where’s the line between that and just kind of doing customer service management, right? That’s probably not the relationship we want professors and students to have. And this also can be pressure about how hard or easy someone is as a grader, how difficult a course is seen. Difficult is often seen in negative terms by students. And so if professors’ north star is getting a good rating on their course evaluations, that might be a different set of incentives than if their goal were to create the best learning environment for their students.\nJack Stripling So there’s a few different touch points of people who are involved in this process. There’s the students that we’ve talked about who may or may not know the gravity of what they’re doing. There’s the professors who have some skepticism about these evaluations and their efficacy. What about administrators or department chairs who presumably are looking at the results? What’s your sense of how they’re using them and how they feel about them?\nBeckie Supiano Yeah, I mean, I think, again, anyone who’s really looked into this topic is going to have some reservations. And we’ve written in The Chronicle about instances of colleges that have really overhauled their process because professors have been swayed by the literature out there, the research literature showing that there’s at best a weak and maybe no relationship between learning as measured on student performance on exams and how students rate their professors. So “what are we measuring here” is a concern. And then also there’s a lot of evidence that students’ responses are full of implicit bias against professors, particularly women and professors of color, but other identities too. And then, you know, students are harsher on professors teaching certain kinds of courses, right? Is this course required or not? Is it quantitative or not? So, you know, just seeing some of those patterns I think would give most people working in higher education some pause. But I think the real issue here is that most people in higher education leadership aren’t really in a position to evaluate teaching in a different way. How would they do that? I mean, there isn’t an agreed upon understanding of what good teaching is. A lot of people in higher education don’t really think it’s something you can define or measure. And so this is sort of the thing everyone is doing because doing something else would be really hard.\nJack Stripling So Beckie, I think part of what we would hope for with a teaching evaluation is a well-rounded view of a professor. So you’d get a high response rate, you’d have people dispassionately evaluating professors. What’s your sense of whether that’s happening?\nBeckie Supiano Good question. So let’s talk about the response rate first. That’s really important, especially if you’re doing a numerical rating, because if you’re averaging a bunch of numbers, you want to have good representation from the class. And everyone’s provided this rating. It’s not all hinging on just a few students who might have extreme, strong opinions that are leading them to fill this out.\nWe know that since course evaluations have moved online and are done now on students’ own time outside of class, the response rates are really low in a lot of cases. So even if this were an otherwise really good survey tool, that would be concerning. There are things that professors can do to get a better response rate, like ask students to fill it out in class. There’ve also been some experiments where instructors have given a small number of extra credit points if a certain percentage of students fill it out. There are some colleges that technically require students to fill this out. I think some of the same ones that give students access to other students’ evaluations of other courses. So there are things you could do to get a higher response rate. Those things are usually not happening. Then there’s a question of how the people who are interpreting this information, right, the professors who are hopefully looking at this to get some formative feedback about their instruction, and then the people, you know, in a department trying to decide is this person an adequate teacher or not, they should have a sense of how to interpret these results. And you know, just thinking about what do these numbers show you? What happens if you average them? What kind of comparisons are reasonable to make just statistically? Again, probably not happening on most campuses.\nAnd even if you were doing all of those things, there is this other concern that the results with students’ feedback about their instructors is colored by bias. We have better data on this about gender than race, just because the professoriate is pretty overwhelmingly white on many campuses. So it’s hard to get good data, you know, looking at different racial groups just numerically. But we know that students are harsher on women. There’s one paper out there that shows students have gendered expectations about who teaches in their own discipline. Usually, that would mean men, but not always. It depends on what your department is, what you’re majoring in. And that students penalize professors — meaning give them harder feedback — if the professor differs from the students’ expectations, right? So basically, if students think professors in this discipline are supposed to be women, they’ll be harder on a man. If they think professors are supposed to be men, they’re harder on women. Of course, just mathematically, generally speaking, this is a penalty for women who are less represented in higher level professor roles.\nJack Stripling What do you hear about how maybe interactions with students follow this gender dynamic? Do you think there are different expectations in terms of how a woman professor might interact with a student than a male professor?\nBeckie Supiano Yeah, this comes up a lot in a bunch of ways that students have different expectations and different sort of descriptive language for how they talk about professors based on gender. It kind of boils down to, in general, there seems to be a tendency for students to take men more seriously and to expect women to be more caring, kind of motherly toward them. And that’s hard to get away from. Another study on course evaluations had TAs teaching an online class. And when they told students, the TA who they never interacted with in person, was a man versus a woman, like the same interactions were rated differently, which shows there is just some deep cultural idea about what men and women are supposed to be like that’s hard for students or any of us to move away from. There’ve been other studies that have looked at, you know, can you take steps to mitigate this bias in students’ feedback? Not really. Can you train people to spot it when they’re reading the results? Also kind of not really. So this is a stubborn problem.\nJack Stripling You know, there’s part of me that looks at this skeptically and says, well, of course professors don’t like teaching evaluations. No one likes to be evaluated, least of all by a 20-year-old. I mean, God forbid. But the more you talk about it and the more I’ve read about it, the more I see that there is some real research about this that’s concerning in terms of the biases you described. We had a reader who wrote to us who said that the response on her campus had gone from something like 99 percent to 5 or 15 percent in terms of who is returning these because they’ve all gone online. I talked to a friend of mine just yesterday who’s a professor at a community college. I was asking him about this. He said, look, they’re doing this at home. I don’t know if they’re sitting around drunk deciding, you know, whether or not I’m a good professor. And there’s a lot of weight behind this. So we’re leaving this sort of controlled environment that maybe used to exist where everybody sat down and dutifully filled these out to something quite different. And it makes me think of things like TripAdvisor, where the person who is the most happy or least happy is likely to write a review of a hotel or restaurant, and the middle gets ignored. Do you see any relationship between how we evaluate hotels and restaurants and how people are evaluating professors on college campuses?\nBeckie Supiano Yeah, I think that comparison would probably make a lot of professors cringe, right? Because when you’re evaluating a restaurant or a hotel, it’s kind of fine, I think, for it to mainly be about if you liked it, if you felt satisfied. I mean, that’s what you’re paying for, right, is to experience those things. Is that really what we want students to be getting out of college or is it something else, right? I mean, if you think the idea is for students to have sort of the most frictionless possible experience where they go through the motions of classes and enjoy that, that’s one thing. But if we want them to learn stuff, that’s at cross purposes with enjoyment sometimes, or at least in the short term. And so, you know, it’s not just that satisfaction maybe shouldn’t be the only thing we care about; it’s that it might actually, especially when the semester’s not even over yet, just not be the right thing to look at at all. I mean, I think many of us can look back on our own educations and think about things that felt great at the time, that really ended up not being very educationally valuable. And also courses that maybe we kind of suffered through where we actually did learn a lot, but we didn’t realize it until later when we got to the next thing.\nJack Stripling I’m also struck by the idea that professors who are conscious of how the evaluation might come out might teach differently or act differently. We’ve already talked about women being expected to be mothers to students. But what about just in terms of what you’re doing in the classroom? Do you think that could be affected by the fact of knowing that students are going to evaluate you at the end?\nBeckie Supiano Yeah, I mean, when we asked professors for their feedback and after our colleague Beth McMurtrie wrote a story about evaluations, we invited readers to weigh in with their own experiences and several hundred of them did. And a few of them touched on this very thing, Jack, right? We heard some professors say they avoided pushing against students’ preordained opinions with facts from their course because they didn’t want to upset them, because they an eye on the fact that they were going to be evaluated. And also, you know, professors feel this pressure to be incredibly responsive. And again, professors probably should be responsive to students, but this idea of, you know, you’re going to get an instantaneous email answer in like the middle of the night when you’re studying probably isn’t really very reasonable. And in the last several years, we’ve seen professors kind of run themselves into the ground, trying to be so very responsive. And so there’s concern about that. And then, really, one of the things that worries me the most, just as a teaching beat reporter, is that professors might be disincentivized to try new teaching approaches, even ones that have very promising evidence from other instructors, because doing something new in the classroom often doesn’t go great the first time. And if you’re in an environment where you’re being judged on your results right now, with no context, then it’s much better to just do what’s expected adequately than to try something new that might be better. And so course evaluations can really be a hindrance to professors trying to improve their instruction, kind of perversely, given that they’re supposed to be giving professors feedback to improve their instruction. So one of the things we know from literature on teaching and learning is that when professors have students be more actively engaged in their learning in class, it tends to be educationally valuable. So instead of your classic model where someone is standing up on a stage giving you a lecture – in a big class, right, not a little discussion seminar – the move is instead for students to do some preparation at home before they get to class and then spend class time solving problems, often collaboratively with their classmates, with the support of the professor in the room who might be picking questions that are similar to something they’ll be expected to do on the exam, that have sort of a common stumbling point that many students will struggle with. And then the professor can walk the students through, like, oh, a bunch of you got this question wrong. Let’s look at the misunderstanding underneath that so that you understand the next time it comes around. Basically, when people have to apply something, they learn it better than if they just listened to someone talking about it. And often professors will make analogies to learning a musical instrument or playing a sport that someone could describe it to you all day long, but until you try to do it, it’s really hard to know if you can or not. So active learning has a lot of good evidence behind it. One of the things we know though, is that students don’t like it. Students don’t wanna work in groups, students don’t wanna do problems in class. Students prefer lectures in many cases, especially If someone’s good at giving one. You can hear a really nice fluid lecture. You feel great, like, oh, that was so interesting. I learned stuff. I took some notes, maybe. But that doesn’t mean any of it really stuck for you. And then, I guess, in theory, you’re supposed to go home and do those practice problems yourself and see if you can apply it. But are you really gonna do that? We know that students don’t always do that. In other words, there’s this understanding that active learning is pedagogically valuable but disliked by students. So if you’re a professor, and you’re kind of thinking like, oh, maybe I want to try doing a little bit of this active learning in my class. I’ve heard it’s really good. It helps student performance. It helps them, you know, do better in their subsequent courses. Great. But you know that students are going to dislike it and then students are going to evaluate you, and that’s going to matter for your own career trajectory. You kind of might not want to do it, even if you think it would be better for students and maybe better for you.\nJack Stripling So Beckie, you mentioned that we got feedback from some faculty members about teaching evaluations. What specifically did they share?\nBeckie Supiano We heard from some 300 professors and they didn’t hold back. I’ll read you just a few examples, Jack, of the things that people wrote in to tell us. “It has generated a culture of fear and pandering to students’ whims … I spend a lot of time adding niceties to my emails so they do not accuse me of being mean or something similar.” And, “emails must be replied to at all hours and every day of the week. Constant extensions must be granted and extra help provided, even on general things like writing skills. And most importantly, I have to spend more time than ever in my career acting as emotional support for students who come to me to talk for long periods of time about personal issues and mental health crises.”\nJack Stripling Wow, so it sounds like we’re in a culture among some of these professors who feel like they really just gotta keep the customer satisfied.\nBeckie Supiano Yeah, I think that is the message a lot of professors have gotten from this way of evaluating their teaching.\nJack Stripling Stick around, we’ll be back in a minute.\nBREAK\nJack Stripling What you said about active learning and that sort of being a drag for students is interesting to me, because I can see being in a class and sort of going through drills just being exhausting, and leaving that class not feeling like it was fun. But this is probably the second or third time I’ve brought up Dead Poets Society on this podcast, but I’m gonna do it yet again. We have this Hollywood ideal of a professor who taps into something in the student, and inspires that student, and makes that student develop a love of whatever the course is about. This typically in Hollywood is set in the humanities. But, is there nothing to that? Is there no value in being an inspiring teacher?\nBeckie Supiano I wouldn’t say there’s no value. I think we all like being inspired and maybe it’s helpful, but it’s different from learning.\nJack Stripling No, Beckie.\nBeckie Supiano I’m sorry. It’s just like learning is hard, right? I mean, think about it, even just as a writer, does it always feel great while you’re doing it? It doesn’t. It’s work. Learning is work. It’s taxing. And we are always kind of looking, all of us, for some shortcut, right, to not have to really do the work. But at a certain point, it really is work. And sometimes just thinking back, I mean, [I] spend probably too much time re-evaluating my own education in light of what I’m learning about in my reporting now. It’s like, oh, I had some teachers and professors who I really enjoyed being in class with and I would have told you they were amazing at the time. And in retrospect, I maybe didn’t learn a ton from them or I learned some things, but not really the material they were supposed to be teaching me.\nJack Stripling Right.\nBeckie Supiano And I had other instructors along the way who were not the snazziest, not the most exciting, but who really did create conditions where I actually learned the material and still know it and can use it. And I’m at a point now where I can see the value in that. And that’s kind of why I think this short term, in the moment, how’d you feel about class… I mean that tells you something. I don’t want to say student feedback isn’t important. Students can point to some real glaring problems that no one else is in a position to see, like if someone is being verbally abusive to students or just not covering the material the course is supposed to.\nJack Stripling Or super disorganized.\nBeckie Supiano Something, yeah, something egregious or just something, you know, a problem like being disorganized. Like that’s a fixable problem that your department should probably know about if you’re struggling with that as an instructor.\nJack Stripling I can see how the student has sort of a limited perspective about whether the course was effective. And you’ve mentioned that there’s research out here about teaching evaluations and their effectiveness. What can you tell us about that?\nBeckie Supiano Yeah, there’ve been a bunch of smaller studies trying to show: Is there a link between how students rate their professor and the students’ learning? I think typically this is looking at performance on that final exam, which students would be taking after they’ve rated their professor to see, you know, is this related? Because generally there isn’t some agreed upon sense of like, what is good teaching, other than teaching that leads to learning, right? And learning we measure usually by looking at student performance. Again, these are not perfect measures, but it’s what’s generally used.\nA while back, like 2016-17, there was a meta-analysis where a team of scholars looked at all the evidence from a bunch of different studies that have been done on this and kind of got under the hood of the methodology and really tried to see like, what is this connection between how professors are evaluated, like professor’s ratings and student learning. And they concluded there’s really not a link, and that the individual studies that found one had methodological problems or other things that hadn’t really been accounted for. And the authors of that paper came down pretty hard on like, if what you’re trying to do is have good teaching that leads to learning, this isn’t the tool for you. This is really capturing student satisfaction.\nJack Stripling I feel like we should pause on this. So, a meta-analysis that looked at a lot of the other research around this, found that there’s really no correlation between how highly students rate their professors and whether they learned anything.\nBeckie Supiano: That’s right.\nJack Stripling: That seems like a problem, Beckie.\nBeckie Supiano I mean, it does, right? And so I think about this sometimes as a higher education reporter, right? Like there’s just some stuff that we’re all just used to. We’ve been writing about the same things for years. It’s like, oh, everyone knows this. Like if I tell — like when I talk to professors, a lot of them will say to me in an interview about their teaching, well, you know, no one really ever taught me how to teach. And I just nod along. I don’t even write that down. Like I’ve heard that eleventy billion times. I know no one probably taught this person how to teach. That’s just normal. But if I go and talk to someone who doesn’t work at a college and doesn’t think about higher ed all day and say, well, you know, most professors really have no training in education or content knowledge about it, that sounds really surprising to people who are maybe like saving up to send their kid to college or people who graduated themselves and just kind of assumed their professors knew something about teaching. But people in higher ed land know the assumption is that your content knowledge expertise is the prerequisite to being a good teacher, and the rest of it just kind of magically happens, or doesn’t.\nJack Stripling Are there colleges that are looking at these facts on the ground, understanding there might be a problem here, and trying to do something better?\nBeckie Supiano There are. Yeah, it’s work. One college that’s going through this process right now is Hamilton College in New York. Maybe six or seven years ago, the University of Southern California had a big overhaul of how they evaluate teaching. And you know, there are other things you can do too. You can review someone’s course materials. You could also look at, is someone going out of their way to improve as an instructor? Colleges often provide some sort of professional development in teaching. Most professors don’t take advantage of it. The ones who do could theoretically have that incorporated into the view of how they are as an instructor. And the professors who’ve overhauled their whole course to align it better with what we know about effective teaching and learning. And sometimes it takes a few years to see good results from something like that, but you could know what someone was trying to do and why. And, you know, give them credit for that instead of the system we have now that again, kind of rewards people for just going through the motions of what’s expected and not doing something that might backfire, but that also might be better.\nJack Stripling So we know there are some places that are investing time and effort into this, but what might be standing in the way of improving this system?\nBeckie Supiano Oh, it’s the usual things, Jack. It’s time and money, right? Look, colleges don’t put undergraduate education front and center from a financial standpoint. They just don’t. I mean, you see these really large enrollment courses. Is that because someone has decided that’s the best way for students to learn is to put 400 students in a room? No, it’s cost benefit analysis, right? Like you can, you can do it that way. That doesn’t mean it’s the best way to do it, right? To come up with some other way to evaluate teaching, you would have to figure out what you think good teaching is and then spend the time and money. Like it would take professors and administrators digging into this probably more, not just putting it all on students doing free labor for you, rating their professor. And you might not always like what you find either, right? Like if you start to do a more thorough investigation about teaching and come up with some sense of good or bad teaching, you have to be prepared to take some kind of action based on that, right? And I don’t know that anyone really has the appetite to do that. The places that I know of that have changed their approach have really done it, not even so much from a concern about like, let’s provide a better educational environment — although I’m sure they’d say they care about that — it’s really been from this understanding of like, oh, this is unfair to our faculty that this is how we’re evaluating them, right? Like, maybe it would be best for students if colleges put more time and energy into providing really good learning environments that would set students up for future success. And that conversation is just kind of rare, honestly, in higher ed.\nJack Stripling And part of it being because it takes time and money to do some of these other things that you’re describing. But I wonder if it’s worth sort of closing on what might be the philosophical barriers to developing a better teaching evaluation system. There are some assumptions, I think, baked in about teaching, how it works, and whether people can actually get better at it. How might those assumptions affect whether there’s a hunger for developing a better way of evaluating teaching?\nBeckie Supiano Yeah, that’s a good question. So I think most people in higher ed have kind of clear ideas about what it takes to be a successful researcher and what goes into that. There is not a comparable understanding or appreciation of teaching, right? Teaching is devalued in our society, certainly, you know, looking at how K-12 teachers are treated and thought of, generally speaking, it’s not like a high status line of work. And the idea is that if someone on the faculty really has great scholarly expertise, then that’s all it takes to be a good instructor. Students kind of sit at the feet of this content knowledge expert and absorb by osmosis their knowledge. There isn’t really any evidence to support that that’s how learning works. And we do know some stuff about learning from psychology and other related fields. We also have evidence in higher ed that good instruction does play a role in student performance. Not the only role, of course, right? Students have to show up ready to learn. They have to do the work. Faculty don’t have a magic wand. But we know that when professors actually take steps to change the way they teach, it can lead to real results. But that idea is at odds with this culture that just thinks, you know, teaching is some like God-given, natural ability. And that just being really smart and someone who did well in school yourself means that you can teach.\nJack Stripling Oh my. Well, It sounds like we would have to let go of this myth of the natural teacher in order to make a lot of progress on this. But I’m glad you’re reporting on it, Beckie, and thank you for sharing your insights about it.\nBeckie Supiano Sure thing.

Founded by Charlie Kirk, the right-wing provocateur, the group thrives on an “owning the libs” mentality that is often trained on left-leaning professors. But this brand of conservatism, while big on bellicose taunts, is short on the foundational ideas that have made conservatism such a lasting intellectual tradition. At least that’s the view of Jon Shields, a right-leaning professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College. For conservatism to thrive in the future, Shields argues, professors of all political stripes should help teach the MAGA crowd about Edmund Burke and the other big thinkers who have long provided the conservative movement with meaningful ballast.\nTo continue reading for FREE, please sign in.\nSign In\nOr subscribe now to read with unlimited access for as low as $10/month.\nDon’t have an account?

Founded by Charlie Kirk, the right-wing provocateur, the group thrives on an “owning the libs” mentality that is often trained on left-leaning professors. But this brand of conservatism, while big on bellicose taunts, is short on the foundational ideas that have made conservatism such a lasting intellectual tradition. At least that’s the view of Jon Shields, a right-leaning professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College. For conservatism to thrive in the future, Shields argues, professors of all political stripes should help teach the MAGA crowd about Edmund Burke and the other big thinkers who have long provided the conservative movement with meaningful ballast.\nListen Here\nRelated Reading\nThese Professors Help Students See Why Others Think Differently (The Chronicle)\nLiberal Professors Can Rescue the G.O.P.

I think that’s the deep problem and it’s one I think the right really needs to attend to.\nJack Stripling On a lot of college campuses today, conservative students seem mostly concerned with “owning the libs.” Turning Point USA, a right-wing group founded by the conservative provocateur Charlie Kirk, has captured the energy and imagination of young men in particular. The group has inspired campus stunts like affirmative action bake sales, in which customers are charged different prices for cookies based on race. This MAGA-style of conservatism is appealing to a certain strain of college bros, and there’s little barrier to entry. You needn’t be versed in the conservative intellectual tradition to join Kirk’s army of campus crusaders. A love of snark and a general skepticism toward the liberal excesses of the academy is sufficient. All of this worries Jon Shields, a professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College. Shields is a conservative professor who shares the Kirk crowd’s concerns about the academy’s liberal bent. But he’s troubled that modern-day conservatism has been reduced to campus pranks and childish taunts. For the movement to thrive long-term, Shields argues, young people need exposure to the deeper ideas that undergird conservative thought. But can professors really win over the MAGA crowd with books about Edmund Burke? And how might President Trump’s aggressive posture toward higher education complicate matters? I dove into those questions in a recent interview with Shields, who has a lot to say about the left-wing professors and right-wing jokers who tend to dominate campus politics.\nJack Stripling So Professor Shields, thanks for coming on College Matters.\nJon Shields Delight to be here.\nJack Stripling So we’re talking to you at a fascinating, and for some people, I think, frightening moment in American history, and higher education specifically The nation’s colleges and universities are really right in the middle of the larger political debate we’re having in this country. As you know, the Trump administration has targeted colleges for their DEI practices, they’re gutting the Department of Education, slashing research funding, even arresting students who have participated in pro-Palestinian protest. You’re a self-identified conservative professor, who I think shares some skepticism about higher education’s liberal bent. How are you feeling about all of this?\nJon Shields Well, sort of frustrated, I’d say. On the one hand, I loathe Donald Trump. I find him to be a dangerous demagogue, I’m appalled at some conservative academics who’ve embraced him. But I do think the university bears some real blame for what’s happened. I think it’s the case that the humanities curriculum has become much more politicized. That’s true. That’s a real problem. And so, you know, for example, at many universities, I think we have a narrowing of the curriculum around topics that are of special interest to the left. I also think we clearly have a speech problem. There’s too much survey data of students to deny that at this point. You know, there is a climate of self-censorship that’s harmful. And those are truly serious problems. And when you look back and think about what we have collectively done about it in the university, I’d say mostly we’ve kept our head in the sand and pretended like we don’t have a problem. And that’s been a huge mistake. My colleague and friend, John Zimmerman, who teaches history of education at the University of Pennsylvania, he put this well a few years back. He said, if we don’t own our own problems, Ron DeSantis will, and we won’t like what he does with it. So I think it would have been much better if we had admitted that we have a problem here in the university. And then, in the very next breath, talked about the things we were going to do to correct it. And that would have included, I think, sending some real credible signals to the outside world that we’re doing something to address these problems. But instead, I think we’ve mostly just been in denial. And I think that isn’t credible. And I think we’re now paying, I think, a fairly predictable price for that neglect.\nJack Stripling We’ve seen public opinion turning against higher education for years and part of this is due to a perception that higher ed is hostile to conservatives or just doesn’t allow for conservative intellectuals to thrive within the academy. So are you saying that this is sort of the chickens coming home to roost; that higher education brought this political pressure upon itself to some degree?\nJon Shields Well, I would say in part. I mean, I do think we bear some responsibility. Obviously, there are problems happening on the right, too. The right’s going, certainly movement conservatism has gone in a reckless and dangerous direction. Donald Trump is, as I mentioned, a dangerous demagogue. Clearly, there are deep and profound problems on the American right. And when I say this, I don’t mean to make light of those really deep and profound problems. But yeah, I do think that the university needs to, like any institution, it needs to think of ways to enhance and preserve its public legitimacy. And we should have been better, I think, custodians of the university. And I think it ... I do think there are some really illiberal currents in the university and so now it’s time I think we need to attend to those in a serious way or else I think these problems will just continue to fester and get worse.\nJack Stripling And you’re saying these critical things about Trump and the political movement as it exists now from the position of someone who identifies as a political conservative and intellectual conservative, correct?\nJon Shields: That’s right.\nJack Stripling: So I want to ask you specifically about the conflict between the Trump administration and Columbia University. He has since picked fights with a lot of universities, but this is a significant one. In March, the Trump Administration canceled about $400 million in federal grants and contracts to the university, saying it had failed to rein in antisemitism on the campus. That led to negotiations in which the university acceded to a number of demands. One of the agreements was to expand intellectual diversity of the faculty with an eye toward reinforcing what the university described as fairness in Middle East studies. It sounds like a university under financial threats from the federal government is agreeing to hire a particular kind of professor. specifically professors who might be more sympathetic to the Trump administration’s positions on a number of issues, like Israel. I’m wondering what you make of that?\nJon Shields I do think some of these fields have been captured by a fairly ideological group of folks. You know, Middle East studies is a good example. And there certainly needs to be more pluralism in higher education. But bringing that about is really challenging for a lot of reasons. I mean, for one, those who are most concerned about the pluralism in the university tend to be university presidents, deans, et cetera, those who worry about the sort of public legitimacy of their institution. They have to deal with outside actors, right? Alums, politicians, et cetera. But professors are the ones who do the hiring. And they’re often a lot less concerned with the sort of public legitimacy of the university, right. They often just simply replicate themselves.\nSo that’s one problem. But it’s also the case that there aren’t many, you know, if you’re trying to hire conservatives, there aren’t many in the PhD pipeline. And why is that the case? I think there’s sort of a structural story there as well. I think when conservatives get to college as undergraduates, they often are required to take courses in the social sciences and humanities. And when they do, they often discover that they like those courses less than their liberal peers. You know, they take Intro to Sociology, or they take American History. And those courses are often framed around progressive concerns and interpretations. And so conservative students tend to not like them nearly as much as, again, their liberal peers. And this isn’t just my speculation. There was a really good study done recently on liberal arts colleges, and it was trying to predict the factors that best predict undergraduate major. It was interested in why some students choose to major in biology and others choose to major in literature. And it found that the single best predictor of undergraduate major was students’ politics. With conservatives sorting into STEM fields, liberals and progressives much more likely to sort themselves into the social sciences and humanities. And so just as, you know, the nation is sorting themselves, you know, as citizens — we sort ourselves into blue states and red states and different kinds of communities — undergraduates are also sorting themselves in colleges and universities, right? They’re sorting themselves into different majors. And so it’s not surprising that we find, you know, more conservative professors in the natural sciences than we do in the social sciences and the humanities. You know and at the same time I think young conservatives are pushed away from the university by the populist right, you know, who says the university is just deeply corrupt and they should stay away from it and do something else. So that said, a lot of these fields struggle, even if they wanted to, even if they wanted to hire conservatives or non-progressives, they would have a tough time doing it because there are so few in the pipeline. And so I’d say in a way, the biggest source of bias in the university is structural. It’s not primarily workplace discrimination. It’s not like Middle East studies departments are looking at lots of files of non-left PhD candidates and throwing them in a pile. They’re just not there. So that’s a really profound problem. So to go back to your question about Columbia, even if they really wanted to broaden the faculty and hire a different ideological mix of young faculty, that would be really challenging.\nJack Stripling I’m wondering about what you’re saying about conservatives sort of dividing themselves through the majors. Part of me wonders is that, oh, they encounter these courses and these professors are super liberal and so they’re turned off by it. Or is it that the very notion of studying things within the realm of sociology, of studying human behavior through a lens of things like race and gender and class, is a turnoff. But it’s also inherent in the discipline itself — that there’s a rejection of what the discipline does, and that may be political or it may not be.\nJon Shields I don’t think it’s inherent in the discipline. I think the progressive interest and theories have become baked into the discipline. But actually I’d say that sociology should be the natural home of particularly cultural conservatives. You know, if you’re interested in culture, in a way, I would say that’s sort of the main interest, one of the most important interests for conservatives. Conservatives tend to be obsessed with culture. You know they worry about the family and religion and these core social institutions. You know, sociology is the main place you can — right, that’s what sociology should be about, is studying these.\nJack Stripling But if you’re interested in culture, it doesn’t seem like it’s a far walk from there to say you’re interested in how things like race and class and gender shape culture. And I can see a conservative saying, this course is about race and class and gender; it’s liberal.\nJon Shields Yes, but it’s not clear to me that conservatives aren’t interested in gender or race. I would say that they are actually quite interested in those things. I mean, they’re not merely interested in those things, they are also interested in, as I mentioned, family and religion and such. I think it has more to do with the way those courses are taught. Here’s one bit of evidence to consider. Amy Binder is a sociologist who studies campus conservatives. And in particular, campus activists. So she studies, you know, conservative undergraduates who get really engaged in activism. And one of the things that struck her about those folks is that, you know, on the one hand, they’re deeply interested in politics. It’s not like they’re not, but they also tend to avoid these kinds of courses, right, courses in the social sciences and the humanities, despite, right, having a real deep interest in politics, including race and inequality. And I think conservatives are interested in those things. But again, I think those courses tend to be, you know, framed and taught in ways that they find narrow, and don’t simply engage them and excite them, I think, in the way that they to progressive students.\nJack Stripling You know, we’ve been talking a lot about the faculty. But you mentioned students, and I wanna bring them into this conversation. When we look at college campuses today, so much of the conservative political energy is around a MAGA-style brand of conservatism. This is sort of the Joe Rogan crowd, the Charlie Kirk crowd. What are your thoughts on that specific brand of conservatism, and why do you think it’s become so popular on college campuses?\nJon Shields Yeah, that’s a good question. I think here, you know, the slow disappearance of conservative faculty really matters. As late as the 1980s, you know, conservative professors were still a sizeable minority on a lot of campuses, and they tended to be the custodians of the conservative intellectual tradition. But today, their numbers are really in decline. You know, at many universities, there are not conservatives in many disciplines. And that means that there are very few courses that expose young students to the conservative tradition of social and political thought. And you know, Mark Lilla once quipped, you know he was looking at the catalog at Columbia University and he says you know if you do that you see course after course of classes on postcolonial thought, but nary a one on conservativism. And I say this because I think it really matters for conservative students. Because if they’re deprived of any real education in what is best in conservativism. You know, if they are not reading Burke, if they aren’t reading Hume, if they’re not reading Milton Friedman, who is teaching them to think and behave like young conservatives? I would say the answer is Turning Point USA. It’s Charlie Kirk.\nJack Stripling Most people will know this, but Charlie Kirk is the founder and president of Turning Point USA. And this is a conservative group. It’s very popular among college students. The group’s gained attention for a lot of provocative stunts. There was a chapter at Clemson University, for example, that hosted an affirmative action bake sale where students sold cookies that were priced differently based on a customer’s race. They’re also behind the Professor Watchlist, which tracks professors that the organization accuses of advancing a leftist agenda. And this has led to the harassment of some professors. It’s seen by many as an attack on academic freedom. But there’s no denying that Charlie Kirk is an influential and powerful figure in the conservative movement right now. And I think for a lot of young conservatives, he’s the future of the political party, the political movement. Are they wrong about that?\nJon Shields Yeah, I mean, I think he represents, I think, the “MAGA-fication” of the campus right, right? I mean, he’s the one who is, I think, exciting a lot of young conservatives and he’s providing a really shabby education. You know, I mean basically he reduces conservativism to mocking liberals. And I think he’s deepening the alienation of young conservatives from the university, right? I mean he’s teaching them to have contempt for it and I think reproducing some of the social patterns I described earlier, right? I mean, he’s encouraging young conservatives to have contempt for the university. And certainly he’s not telling young conservatives, you should go out and become a professor one day, right? I mean, that’s not the education he’s providing. So I think it’s a deeply troubling pattern, and again, unfortunately, I don’t think there are many conservative professors around to try to subvert people like Charlie Kirk. I think their absence has created a space for him. And he sees that opportunity.\nJack Stripling You’ve argued for students to get more Edmund Burke and less Charlie Kirk, essentially. And I wonder if you can highlight the distinctions there. You have mentioned that Kirk’s whole mode is sort of an antagonism toward liberals — an “owning the libs” kind of philosophy. What would a more robust intellectual tradition look like in comparison to that?\nJon Shields Yeah, that’s a good question. I’d say that conservatism and liberalism is really an old quibble about the kinds of creatures that we are, and both see something, I think, that’s true about us human beings. The liberal notices that we can make choices, and those choices often reflect reasonable differences over how to live a good life, and so we want a culture and state that respects that pluralism and that diversity. Conservatism, rightly understood, begins with an insight about human beings as well. And they notice that unlike other creatures, we’re born without really knowing how to live. We are instinctually impoverished and we’re prone to be somewhat wayward. And so we turn to our customs, our traditions, our social institutions, which have developed over oceans of time and those institutions both restrain us, but also guide us. And those institutions are hard to build and easy to destroy. So conservatives, I think, you know, tend to worry about those who want to radicalize them in some way or change our traditions in some profound way. And so, you, know, we conservatives worry about, you know, the decline of marriage. We worry about the decline of religion. You know, we oppose defunding the police, we want to preserve classical education, and so on. But there’s also, it’s a big tradition, and there’s a lot of recurring tensions in conservative thought that I think are especially sharp today. One obvious tension is how we conservatives think about our relationship to liberalism. After all, liberalism is our tradition. And so conservatives, I think, should think about how we preserve what’s best in our liberal tradition.\nBut I guess I’d say, you know, the tension that’s more relevant to your question about Charlie Kirk is conservatives’ relationship to radicalism. You know, on the surface, radicalism seems at odds with conservatism. But sometimes conservatives can come to the conclusion that some of our most venerable institutions can’t be saved. You know, they’ve been so compromised and so there’s nothing left to conserve. So sometimes conservatives can support radical change. And usually it’s, they’re fairly, you know, judicious about making these kinds of judgments. You know, even somebody like David Brooks, a sort of moderate Burkian thinker and op-ed columnist for the New York Times, will say this about our healthcare system. You know he’ll say like, our healthcare is just so broken, we just need to start again. But I think today there’s this sort of, on the populist right, thinkers like Charlie Kirk and others who think that many of our core institutions can’t be saved, you know, and they just want to burn things to the ground. And I think that in the end, there’s a kind of nihilistic impulse there. I think their judgment is just profoundly wrong. You know, they have, they catastrophize everything. And imagine that our institutions are, I think, much more broken than they actually are. And of course this is an impulse we see on the left too, but I think it’s, in a way it’s more harmful to conservatism. Because if we conservatives aren’t defending society’s core institutions, then it’s not clear we’re doing the work we’re supposed to be doing in our society.\nJack Stripling Stick around, we’ll be back in a minute.\nBREAK\nJack Stripling There’s a broader skepticism of institutions, I think, across both parties now. But at the same time, higher education is an institution. And it’s an institution that conservatives really seem to loathe. I’m wondering what the future is if the party and the movement defines itself in opposition to higher education.\nJon Shields You’re also pointing here, Jack, to a deeper class divide that’s opening up within our political system. You’re pointing to a diploma divide, where the right is increasingly courting voters down the class ladder. And it’s interesting, because we often think about this problem in reverse. We think about the Democrats’ challenges reaching working class voters. And, you know, I feel like a day doesn’t go by where there isn’t an op-ed in The New York Times that’s trying to figure out, okay, how do we Democrats and liberals get working class voters back into our tent? But the right has this problem except in reverse. You know, what happens to the right if it loses all of its intellectuals and it becomes completely disconnected from the rich conservative intellectual tradition? I think that’s the deep problem, and it’s one I think the right really needs to attend to.\nJack Stripling Well, it’s based on class, but it’s also based on — is swagger the word? There was a piece you may have seen in The New Yorker in March called “The Battle for the Bros” that was all about the left sort of losing the Joe Rogan crowd. I’m wondering if Jon Shields can win over the Joe Rogan crowd either. Is the conservatism you’re selling appealing at all to a more radical antagonistic brand of conservatism? I mean, do you have any hope of engaging with the bros? Can you win the bros over Jon Shields?\nJon Shields Probably not, but I …\nJack Stripling He says in front of a giant stack of books.\nJon Shields Yeah, I mean, but I guess I’m more worried, you know, just as a professor, about the future leaders of the American right and not about barstool conservatives out there in middle America. And I think that one reason it’s important to teach conservative political thought at its best to undergraduates is, I think, well, one virtue of doing that, of course, it helps the legitimacy problem that the university confronts right now. But I actually, I think, just taking a longer view, if we want a better right one day, if we want a more thoughtful right one day, I don’t see how we get there; if all young conservatives have been exposed to is Charlie Kirk’s version of conservatism, how does the next generation of conservative leaders take some other course if they haven’t been exposed to some alternative to it? And so I think the one thing, you know, I don’t have much power as a professor, right, over the fate of American right, and certainly my colleagues don’t. It seems like the one thing we can do is do what we do best, you know, right, which is to teach undergraduates and to be faithful to our calling. And I would say, Jack, not just teach this tradition in a serious way, but also to reach out and mentor conservative students. You know, like, if I’m a progressive professor, particularly in a red state, the first thing I would do is start developing a course on conservatism, and I would start reaching out to, you know, the Turning Point USA chapter, right, and mentor these kids and talk to them and help them develop better speaker lists. And I think there’s a missed opportunity here for us to reach some of these young students before they go on and take their place in the political class.\nJack Stripling I’m wondering, the spirit of my question, Jon, about can you make headway with this crowd is about whether a pure intellectual conservative tradition can be made cool. Part of what’s happening with Turning Point USA is there’s something cool about it. In the same way that there was something cool about Bill Clinton playing the saxophone on Arsenio Hall or Barack Obama being cool, that had an appeal to 18 to 22-year-olds in a certain political bent. And if you’re trying to sell Edmund Burke, how do you make it cool?\nJon Shields Burke isn’t sexy.\nJack Stripling I’ve seen photos. I agree.\nJon Shields Well, maybe you can’t make it cool in quite the same way, but I think you can use it to expose the vacuity and just emptiness of what Kirk is offering, and maybe that’s enough. Maybe it doesn’t have to be sexy and cool, but precisely because there is wisdom in tradition, it can be profoundly compelling, and again, maybe that’s enough.\nJack Stripling Well, I don’t know where the institution of marriage falls on the cool spectrum. I think it goes in and out of fashion, but I know that you’ve worked with students in talking to them about marriage as one example of the conservative intellectual tradition. Talk to me about what you assign to them and how they respond to it.\nJon Shields Yeah, I mean, I usually teach marriage in a course I call The American Culture Wars. And in that course, I pick about six or seven controversies. And for each controversy, I pick a book by a conservative intellectual and one by a progressive one. And marriage is always one of the controversies that I assign and that I teach. And yeah, marriage is a great topic to really expose students to this tradition because as you know, I think conservative intellectuals are obsessed with marriage. I think it’s as varied as conservatism is across time and place, there’s always a sense that marriage is a core social institution and that the future of our civilization passes by way of marriage. If that institution collapses, there isn’t much hope for us. We’re not going to make it. You know, it’s an institution that’s... it’s hard to build a marriage culture. But as we’ve seen, it’s one that’s very easy to destroy. And I think, particularly in the American context, it’s a weakening institution. And in a way, it is really at the heart of our political troubles to some degree, too. I mean, so much of the diploma divide and so much of our inequality today is connected to the collapse of this institution. And so one of the things I try to impress on my students, too, Jack, is that liberalism and conservatism are, you know, they’re traditions that structure our thinking. There’s room for lots of heterodoxy. They don’t completely determine where we end up. I often tell them, look, I tell my progressive students, you know, you could be concerned about marriage for purely progressive reasons. You know like, you know you can worry about inequality and say, gee, we need a better marriage culture, for example. And likewise I tell this …\nJack Stripling How so? Unpack that for me. What do you mean by that?\nJon Shields Children in single-parent households are at a great disadvantage. But also, here’s a question: Is it a just country in which you have to have a college degree to have a happy family, right? I mean, it’s one of the tragedies of American society, I think, is that marriage has become an elite kind of privilege. People here in my college town in Claremont tend to be married, and so therefore they tend to have lifelong partners and that brings them, as we know, lots of social goods. You know people who are married, they live longer, they’re happier, they’re wealthier. And I think most of my students who come from very privileged backgrounds would consider their life a failure if they didn’t have a stable happy marriage one day. And so I think one of the tragedies of our moment is that this has become just one more luxury good. It’s folks who get college degrees primarily, or disproportionately at least, who get to have lifelong partnerships. And everyone else is, you know, down the class ladder, there’s much more gender distrust, there’s much more hostility, there’s more unhappiness. JD Vance talks about this very powerfully actually in his memoir, right? I mean, for somebody like Vance, the American dream — you know, he went to Yale Law School. But the American dream is not that everyone gets to go to Yale law school, but it should include a happy family.\nJack Stripling I want to ask you about a movement that’s been happening over the past decade or so. A number of public universities, including Florida and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have opened centers or institutes devoted to the study of the Western canon and American civics. Republicans tend to love these projects, which are seen as friendly to scholars on the political right. Jon, is this affirmative action for conservative professors?\nJon Shields I’m not sure that’s quite right, but it is creating opportunities for academics who are doing more traditional kinds of research, right? So it’s, I mean, a lot of these institutes, for example, want to hire folks who can teach great books, right? That’s not something just conservatives do, but is something that conservatives often are disproportionately attracted to. So I’d say it’s not conservative action in some narrow sense, right? Where it’s like, there’s some litmus test and you have to be a conservative to get hired and they’re hiring people on the basis of their political allegiances. But it is sort of hiring in areas and fields and it does wanna hire folks who wanna study the kinds of things that conservatives tend to be attracted to. So in that sense, I’d say it’s creating a lot of opportunity for young conservatives.\nAnd so I guess the question is whether all this new opportunity creates some more interest in young conservatives to go out and get PhDs. We’ll see. I think it’s actually a good time for those of us who have bright, center-right undergraduates who are thinking about academia to give it a shot. I do think there’ll be opportunity for conservatives. The question is, is whether they’ll seize it. And that’s unclear to me.\nBut to circle back to something I suggested earlier, I would say if you look at the younger professors as a whole coming up in the discipline, I say they seem to be more left than prior generations. So I think that means that the university, if I’m guessing and trying to project on where we’re gonna be in 30 years, my best guess, Jack, is that this discipline will be both more left than it is now, and we’ll have fewer conservatives.\nJack Stripling Wow, OK. I don’t know if you’re optimistic about that then.\nJon Shields No, I’m not, but you know, I, I do think there’s another cleavage in the university that’s worth mentioning. And that’s not so much the left-right distinction, which we’ve talked a lot about, but rather the, I think in a way, the deeper divide in the university, which is between normie liberals on the one hand. So these are sort of old fashioned liberals who, whose politics tend to be left, but don’t think that professors should be activists in the classrooms and don’t do research that’s deeply agenda driven, right? So they’re sort of more old-fashioned liberals. They believe that the university should be an open and tolerant place. They believed that there should be conservative professors ideally in the university. They’re committed to liberalism, right? And then I think you have another camp that’s much more oriented toward social justice traditions, and they tend to think that academics should, you know, change the world and that they should push, I think, a more activist kind of orientation onto their students. And I think that’s actually the much deeper and more profound conflict that’s happening in the university now. And, you know I’m rooting for the liberals, you know? I want them to win. And that’s one of the reasons I’m encouraging them to develop courses on the conservative tradition. I don’t think there’s going to be many conservatives around, perhaps, in the next generation. But there will be normie liberals, certainly. And if we conservatives aren’t around to be the custodians of this intellectual tradition, I hope they take up that mantle and take up the task and teach this tradition. I hope they teach Friedman and Burke and Hume and others. And so we’ll see. But I think that’s the best hope for the university.\nJack Stripling Frustrated liberals may save the academy, is that right?\nJon Shields Yeah. And I think their challenge is that they haven’t really seen themselves as a faction or interest group. They’re not a group of folks who are good at organizing and really leaning into university politics. They want to do their research, they want to go home, and they want to kind of do their thing.\nJack Stripling But they may be people who have tended to vote Democratic, but at the end of the day have been skeptical about pronouns, DEI, some of the other things.\nJon Shields Deeply, deeply. And I think they’re actually ambivalent about some of the things that Trump is doing, right? I mean, so I do think it’s sort of on their shoulders to be better custodians of the university, you know, it’s in their hands. And, you know, so I’d say they have to be very careful, for example, about who they hire, you know. It seems to me they have to be careful not to hire faculty who are deeply illiberal and who don’t support the notion that the university should be a tolerant and open community.\nJack Stripling Jon, we’ll keep an eye on this. I appreciate you talking with us today about it. I think it’s a great start to a conversation.\nJon Shields Thank you, Jack.\nJack Stripling College Matters from The Chronicle is a production of The Chronicle of Higher Education, the nation’s leading independent newsroom covering colleges.

Here is an excerpt.\nUntil recent years, colleges engaged in little formal planning. Today, however, virtually every college and university in the nation has an elaborate strategic plan. Indeed, whenever a college hires a new president, his or her first priority is usually the crafting of a new strategic plan. As in Orwell’s 1984, all mention of the previous administration’s plan, which probably had been introduced with great fanfare only a few years earlier, is instantly erased from all college publications and Web sites. The college president’s first commandment seems to be, “Thou shall have no other plan before mine.”\nThe strategic plan is a lengthy document—some are one hundred pages long or more—that purports to articulate the college’s mission, its leadership’s vision of the future, and the various steps that are needed to achieve its goals. The typical plan takes six months to two years to write and is often subject to annual revision to take account of changing circumstances. A variety of constituencies are usually involved in the planning process—administrators, faculty members, staffers, trustees, alumni, even students. Most of the work, though, falls to senior administrators and their staffs, as well as to outside consultants who may assist in the planning process. The final document is usually submitted to the trustees or regents for their approval. A flurry of news releases and articles in college publications herald the new plan as a guide to an ever brighter future. Hence, as one journalist noted, most strategic plans could be titled “Vision for Excellence.”\nThe growth of planning has a number of origins. University trustees are generally drawn from a business background and are accustomed to corporate plans. Accreditors and government agencies, for their part, are enamored of planning, which they associate with transparency and accountability. Florida, in fact, requires its publicly supported colleges to develop strategic plans. More generally, though, the growth of planning is closely tied to the expansion of college and university administrations. Their growing administrative and staff resources have given them the capacity to devote the thousands of person-hours generally required to develop and formulate strategic plans. Before 1955, only 10 of the very largest universities could afford to allocate staff time to institutional research and planning. But by the late 1960s, several hundred colleges possessed staff resources adequate for that purpose.\nThe strategic plan serves several important purposes for administrators. First, when they organize a planning process and later trumpet their new strategic plan, senior administrators are signaling to the faculty, to the trustees, and to the general community that they are in charge. The plan is an assertion of leadership and a claim to control university resources and priorities. This function of planning helps to explain why new presidents and sometimes new deans usually develop new strategic plans. We would not expect newly elected presidents of the United States simply to affirm their predecessors’ inaugural addresses. In order to demonstrate leadership to the nation, they must present their own bold initiatives and vision for the future. For college leaders, the strategic plan serves this purpose.\nA second and related purpose served by planning is co-optation. A good deal of evidence suggests that the opportunity to participate in institutional decision-making processes affords many individuals enormous psychic gratification. For this reason, clever administrators see periodic consultation as a means of inducing employees to be more cooperative and to work harder. Virtually everyone has encountered this management technique. Some years ago, a former president of my university called to ask my advice before he appointed a new dean of the College of Arts and Sciences. I was pleased to be consulted, and later neither I nor other senior faculty who felt that the new dean was insufficiently experienced voiced so much as a word of opposition when the president announced his appointment.\nIn a similar vein, the university planning process entails months of committee meetings, discussions, and deliberations, during which the views of large segments of the faculty and staff are elicited. For the most part, those involved in the process, even if only peripherally, tend to buy into the outcome and, more important, tend to develop a more positive perception of the administration’s ideas, priorities, and leadership. I can recall being greeted with hostile silence at the faculty club when I asserted that our university’s strategic plan was a waste of paper. I was completely correct. The plan was a waste of paper and within a year was forgotten. Nevertheless, my colleagues who had participated in the planning process were co-opted by it.\nStill another way in which strategic planning serves administrators’ interests is as a substitute for action. Many senior administrators are smooth and glib, in the manner of politicians. These qualities are sure to impress the corporate headhunters who direct contemporary administrative searches, and to help administrators secure job interviews. But, like some of their counterparts in the realm of electoral politics, university leaders’ political dexterity and job-hunting skills are often somewhat stronger than their managerial and administrative capabilities, inevitably leading to disappointment on the campus after they take charge. Indeed, the disparity between their office-seeking savvy and actual leadership ability probably explains why many college and university presidents move frequently from campus to campus. By the time people on the campus have become fully aware of a leader’s strengths and weaknesses, he or she has moved on to another college. Thus, for many administrators, 18 months devoted to strategic planning can create a useful impression of feverish activity and progress and may mask the fact that they are frequently away from campus seeking better positions at other colleges.\nAn individual of my acquaintance was appointed to the position of dean of arts and sciences at an important university. Soon after his appointment, he launched a yearlong strategic-planning process, telling all who would listen that the university’s first priority should be the development of a sound plan of action. During this period, the dean delayed undertaking any new programs and initiatives because, he said, all major activities should comport with the soon-to-be-announced strategic plan. After a year, when the plan was ready, the dean announced that he was leaving to become president of a small college. Apparently the university was too engrossed in planning to notice that the dean was sometimes away on job interviews. Not surprisingly, as soon as he arrived on his new campus, this individual announced that he would lead the college in—what else?—the formulation of a strategic plan.\nIt would be incorrect to assert that strategic plans are never what they purport to be—blueprints for the future. Occasionally a college or university plan does, in fact, present a grand design for the next decade. A plan actually designed to guide an organization’s efforts to achieve future objectives, as it might be promulgated by a corporation or a military agency, contains several characteristic elements. Such a plan typically presents concrete objectives, a timetable for their realization, an outline of the tactics that will be employed, a precise assignment of staff responsibilities, and a budget. Some college plans approach this model. The 2007 strategic plan of the University of Illinois, for example, put forward explicit objectives along with precise metrics, bench marks, timetables, and budgets. The leadership hoped to equal or exceed the performance of several other large public institutions in a number of dimensions. Whether one agreed or disagreed with the goals stated by the plan, there could be little disagreement about the character of the plan, itself. It resembled a corporate plan for expanding market share or a military plan choreographing the movement of troops and supplies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe documents promulgated by most colleges and universities, however, lack a number of those fundamental elements of planning. Their goals tend to be vague and their means undefined. Often there is no budget based on actual or projected resources. Instead the plan sets out a number of fund-raising goals. These plans are, for the most part, simply expanded “vision statements.” One college president said at the culmination of a yearlong planning process that engaged the energies of faculty, administrators, and staffers that the plan was not a specific blueprint, but a set of goals the college hoped to meet.\nObviously what was important was not the plan but the process. The president, a new appointee, asserted his leadership, involved the campus community, and created an impression of feverish activity and forward movement. The ultimate plan itself was indistinguishable from dozens of others and could have been scribbled on the back of an envelope or copied from some other college’s planning document. As I noticed while reading dozens of strategic plans, plagiarism in planning is not uncommon. Similar phrases and paragraphs can be found in many plans. In 2006, the chancellor of Southern Illinois University’s Carbondale campus was forced to resign after it was discovered that much of its new strategic plan, “Southern at 150,” had been copied from Texas A&M University’s strategic plan, “Vision 2020.” The chancellor had previously served as vice chancellor at Texas A&M, where he had coordinated work on the strategic plan. In a similar vein, the president of Edward Waters College was forced to resign when it was noticed that his new “Quality Enhancement Plan” seemed to have been copied from Alabama A&M University’s strategic plan.\nThis interchangeability of visions for the future underscores the fact that the precise content of most colleges’ strategic plans is pretty much irrelevant. Plans are usually forgotten soon after they are promulgated. My university has presented two systemwide strategic plans and one arts-and-sciences strategic plan in the past 15 years. No one can remember much about any of those plans, but another one is in the works. The plan is not a blueprint for the future. It is, instead, a management tool for the present. The ubiquity of planning at America’s colleges and universities is another reflection and reinforcement of the continuing growth of administrative power.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

If they fail to do assignments and miss a substantial number of classes, it’s because they are so busy, even though said busyness -- if the truth be told -- consists mostly of playing video games, watching television, attending sporting events, and going to drunken parties. In my experience, the ones who are truly busy -- because they are working long hours at a job while going to school, have children to mind, or serious health problems -- are rarely the ones who make excuses about busyness.\nIt’s traditional to think that pride is the root cause of the other deadly sins, but sometimes it works the other way around: Many students have too little to do, and, as the saying goes, “idle hands are the devil’s workshop.”\nBut this is not interesting. Slothful students are not news. They have always been thus, and they always will be. To dwell on the shortcomings of students smacks of professorial pride more than anything else. Were most of us any different at their age? If so, it might have been because we had better teachers and better institutions that guided our moral development and had the courage and support to stand behind their beliefs.\nIn some respects, the students are right: Professors are to blame.\nWe cultivate students’ unmerited pride with high praise for mediocre work. And we tolerate all of the other sins by abdicating responsibility for the culture of our classrooms. Again and again, I have heard students say their classes are so easy that almost no effort is required, even for top grades. Residential student life, at many institutions, is mostly free time to explore and indulge one’s vices. And we professors -- too busy chasing our ambitions -- avoid maintaining standards because they are time-consuming and costly to our teaching evaluations.\nOnce again, the traditional model of the “Seven Deadly Sins” provides a helpful means of understanding why so many students are unhappy with their professors, and why so many professors are unhappy in general:\nSloth: Like their students, professors claim to be so busy that they can’t give proper attention to their teaching. Some professors begin classes late and dismiss them early; others rarely keep their posted office hours. Students used to complain about deadwood professors reading their lectures from yellowing notes. That’s less common now than canned PowerPoint presentations, film screenings, and group discussions in which students -- most of whom have not done the reading -- attempt to do the work of the absentee professor.\nAll of those techniques use up class time with a minimum of effort and learning. In addition, professors can avoid the hard work of grading by requiring fewer assignments, making them “objective” (i.e., machine gradable), and -- when written assignments and exams are mandated by the curriculum -- inflating the grades. High grades require less written justification, result in fewer student complaints, and require no follow-up advising.\nOf course, in many contexts, all of this grading can simply be shifted to teaching assistants and adjuncts who will likewise inflate grades for the same reasons. It’s easy to blame the situation on administrators, but the corporate university crept into place because, over the last three decades, professors -- out of apathy and a desire to pursue their own interests -- have slowly abandoned the governance of their institutions to the values of the marketplace.\nADVERTISEMENT\nGreed: Professors often say that they didn’t become teachers out of a desire to get rich, but it’s hard to believe that most professors chose their careers solely out of a desire to foster “social justice” or some other fashionable form of ostentatious altruism. More often, I think people become professors out of a lack of options: What can one do, after all, with an undergraduate degree in medieval studies or art history? Most entry-level jobs seem unsatisfactory to people who think of themselves as exceptionally gifted.\nUnlike doctors and lawyers, most professors forgo big money, but, as a group, they are even more ravenously hungry for status. Humanities faculty members, for example, are less concerned about the higher salaries earned by their counterparts in science (who do have other career options) than they are about what the humanist in the next office is getting paid. This is where greed shades off into pride, but more on that later.\nPerhaps the place where greed is most evident among tenured faculty members is in their general refusal to support better pay and benefits for part-timers and graduate students who increasingly do most of the difficult teaching at the major universities where one finds the tenured professors who are very well paid indeed for that Faustian bargain.\nAnger: Everyone has heard the saying, “Academic fights are so bitter because the stakes are so small.” Every department is a social experiment in which a cluster of people who regard themselves as underpaid and underappreciated are trapped together for decades, forced to endure each other’s annoying eccentricities and utterly predictable habits of mind. Every department is a stew of resentments stretching back at least as far as the careers of the oldest senior professor. Every department meeting -- topics, words, inflections, facial expressions -- is as rich with historical reference as a monologue from Absalom, Absalom!\nADVERTISEMENT\nMarried without the possibility of divorce, angry faculty members exhaust themselves in petty battles over ancient personal resentments that pretend to be principles. And, conversely, because professors become so invested in maintaining the appearance of ideological commitment, it is impossible to discuss matters of principle without the risk of giving personal offense. Instead, professors often choose to cultivate their disagreements in silence or among small clutches of allies who have little more in common than dislike for one powerful person.\nLust: Affairs and adultery happen in departments as they do in other places, but the hostilities linger longer. Apparently, there are also some professors who pursue students in a sexual way, with the perverse justification that it is some kind of initiation into adult life. One recalls the younger Harold Bloom leering at the undergraduate Naomi Wolf (though her belated report of this encounter says more about her lust for media attention than his lust for her). Of course, male faculty members have no monopoly on inappropriate sexual behavior; recall Jane Gallop’s observation that her “sexual preference is graduate students.” It may be, however, that all of the attention given to lust (and its complex relationship with power) in the last few decades has caused professors to stand aloof from their students -- no lunches, no informal mentorship, no emotional warmth, no hugs -- because of the risk of false accusations from people with lust on their minds.\nGluttony: A lot of concern is directed at alcohol consumption by students, and rightly so. But relatively little attention is given to alcohol consumption by professors. Like students, professors have a lot of unstructured time in which the consolations of the occasional drink can easily develop into an addiction that affects one’s performance and judgment in all kinds of ways.\nSometimes professors use pride to turn addiction into virtue: The myth of the “thirsty muse” dramatized by Hemingway and Pollock is still alive, and it includes more than alcohol under the guise of enlightened defiance of bourgeois social norms.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLikewise, obesity for academics is less about gluttony or sloth than it is a form of machismo that crosses gender lines: “I am so busy -- and important -- that I don’t have time to mind my health.” On the other hand, sometimes the thin among us substitute delicacy for overindulgence and make a point of complaining how the food in the faculty cafeteria is inferior to the meals they’ve eaten elsewhere and feel entitled to eat every day.\nEnvy: The whole system of institutional hierarchies and academic ranks seems designed to make professors unhappy with their present circumstances. There is always somewhere better we should be, if only someone in authority would recognize our talents, which are always out of proportion to the place where we work. And even in the context of our present reduced circumstances, someone else has a bigger office, a larger salary, and it’s unfair because we deserve more.\nSo, instead of building cordial relationships with our colleagues and students, we expend our energies trying to impress people somewhere else. We attend conferences not to enhance our knowledge or maintain collegial relationships based on equality, but to seek out the famous and the powerful (whom we secretly resent) and cultivate their approval and patronage.\nOr, if we are so fortunate as to attain titles of eminence, we come to believe that our position is wholly merited by our abilities and adopt a mien of condescension and hauteur that probably does more to breed envy than the unrealized ambitions of thousands whose names we do not care to remember.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPride: If it does nothing else, the process of becoming a professor should involve the recognition of how little one knows. Even in the smallest subfield, there are always new questions, and revolutions in thought arrive with the regularity of new generations of scholars. Perhaps the evident pride of professors is based upon a secret insecurity: Our intellectual and ideological fortresses are built on sand.\nPerhaps the ugliest side of professors is the conviction that specialized knowledge about a few narrow subjects confers intellectual and moral authority on matters about which one knows almost nothing. How is it possible, we wonder, that students who do not share our fascination with the English Civil War and Marxism can somehow also be intelligent and ethical people? How is it that we are not consulted in matters of grave national importance? If the world will not come to us for wisdom, then we will stand aloof and make a world for ourselves where we can torment each other, like Milton’s vision of hell, while the rest of the world goes about the business of living, unconcerned with the petty disputes that cost many of us any possibility of happiness.\nIt is not possible to write about the sins of one’s profession without suggesting that one is somehow superior to others and therefore guilty of pride, among other vices. Ultimately, however, I am writing this column for myself. I am making a confession and an apology, which might be representative of other professors’ experiences, and which may, perhaps, become as helpful to others as it has been for me.\nThomas H.

Benton April 14, 2006\nI’ve been teaching for about 10 years now, and, of course, I was a student for 20 years before that.

So I have some experience observing my students’ sins, and perhaps even more experience committing them.\nThe sins that I see in the everyday life of the typical college student are not great ones. Most of the time, they don’t seem like “sins” at all, even if one accepts the religious significance of the term. But they spring from thoughts and behaviors that, over time, become habits.\nEnabled by institutions, students repeatedly take the path of least resistance, imagining they are making creative compromises with duty that express their unique talents. So they choose self-indulgence instead of self-denial and self-esteem instead of self-questioning. They do not understand that those choices will eventually cause more unhappiness than the more difficult paths they chose not to walk.\nThe traditional model of the “Seven Deadly Sins” provides a helpful means of categorizing -- and perhaps simplifying -- the complicated and cumulative experience I am trying to describe:\nSloth: Students often postpone required readings and assigned preparations, making it hard for them to understand their classes the next day. Gradually, lectures and discussions that were once interesting start to seem boring and irrelevant, and the temptation to skip classes becomes greater and greater, especially when the classes are in the morning. Sometimes students arrive late with -- in my opinion -- insufficient shame, closing the door behind them with a bang. Slothful students regard themselves as full of potential, and so they make a bargain: “I will be lazy now, but I will work hard later.” Like St. Augustine, students say to themselves, “Let me be chaste, but not yet.” More on lust later.\nGreed: Students often pursue degrees not for the sake of learning itself but with the aim of getting a better-paying job, so they can buy a bigger house and fancier cars than those owned by their parents and their neighbors. That often leads to greed for grades that they have not earned. Some students cheat on exams or plagiarize their papers; others, sometimes the most diligent, harass professors into giving them grades unjustified by their performance. The goal of such cheaters and grade-grubbers is not the reality of achievement but the appearance of it. They will then apply to graduate programs or entry-level jobs that they do not really desire and for which they are not really qualified. They want to be lawyers, but they are bored by law courses. They want to be doctors, but they do not care about healing people. They want to go into business, not to provide useful products and services, but to get rich by any means necessary. And so they come to believe that no one has integrity and that there is no basis -- other than the marketplace -- by which value can be judged.\nAnger: Seemingly more often than in the past, professors encounter students who are angered by challenging assignments, which they label -- with bureaucratic self-assurance -- “unfair” or even “discriminatory.” When students do not succeed, they sometimes conclude that their professors are “out to get them” because of some vague prejudice. Students feel entitled to deference by professors who “work for them and should act like it.” They do not come to office hours for clarification about an A-; instead, they argue that they are paying a lot of money and, therefore, deserve a high grade, and, if you don’t give it to them, they will “complain to management,” as if they were sending back food in a restaurant. One hears rumors of cars and homes vandalized by angry students. But, perhaps, the easiest places to find uncensored student rage are the anonymous, libelous evaluations of faculty members found online at Web sites such as RateMyProfessors.com. Often those evaluations say less about the quality of a teacher than they do about the wounded pride of coddled students. More on that topic soon.\nLust: I have seen students come to classes barefoot, with bare midriffs and shoulders, in boxer shorts, bathing suits, and other kinds of clothes that, even by fairly casual standards, are more appropriate for streetwalking than higher learning. When did liberation from uniforms transform itself into the social demand that one prepare to be ogled in the classroom? It is hardly a surprise that on RateMyProfessors.com, students are asked to rate their professors’ “hotness” -- in other words, the teachers’ worthiness to be sexually fantasized about by bored students. Even in high-school classes, as an observer of novice teachers, I have overheard lewd remarks about female teachers from denizens of the back row who fear no rebuke because none is forthcoming from the current culture.\nGluttony: It hardly needs saying that most colleges struggle to control alcohol consumption by students and the embarrassing incidents and tragedies that result from it. But there are other manifestations of gluttony these days. For example, when did it become acceptable for students to eat and drink in class as if they were sitting in a cafeteria? Nowadays, I occasionally encounter a student who thinks it’s OK to consume a large, messy, and odorous meal in class. I once saw a student eat an entire rotisserie chicken, a tub of mashed potatoes with gravy, several biscuits, and an enormous soft drink during the first 10 minutes of a lecture. I felt like a jester in the court of Henry VIII. It seems hard these days to find a student in class whose mouth is not stuffed with food. Such students will often say that they have no other time to eat, but previous generations -- who were no less busy -- managed to consume small snacks between classes. That is why colleges have vending machines.\nEnvy: I think competition is a good thing in education; up to a point, it encourages students to work harder and excel. But the envious student, perhaps daunted by some temporary setback, comes to believe that education is “a rigged game.” Envy is the voice of resignation that cringes at the success of one’s peers: “Listen to her, trying to impress the teacher, like she’s so brilliant. I hate her.” Envy is the feeling that no one “earns” anything because there are no objective criteria of accomplishment; and, as a result, success and failure seem to be based on political and personal preferences. But envy is not limited to differences in effort and ability. Even more pervasive is a sense of unjustified economic inequality, but, it seems to me, the fashionable students in their convertibles who jeer the commuters at the bus stop commit a greater sin than those who envy their money and status.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPride: I once asked a group of 20 students how many thought they were “better than their parents”? All of them raised their hands. I didn’t ask, but I assume they all believed they were better than their teachers too. They would rise higher, be more successful, and transcend the limitations of their elders. We read this belief in our students’ expressions: “What you know is not worth learning. They’re just your opinions anyway. I am young. I have infinite potential. You are old. And you’re just a college professor. But I will be rich and famous someday.” They have rarely been given a realistic assessment of their abilities and prospects. Out of this pride -- nurtured by the purveyors of unearned self-esteem, personal grievance, dumbed-down courses, and inflated grades (often in the guise of liberality) -- the opportunity to earn an education is squandered by prideful students who can make a potential heaven seem like hell.\nThe concept of the “Seven Deadly Sins” comes out of the Christian tradition, but it also has value as an ethical guide or at least as a means of avoiding unhappiness. Increasingly, as a professor who teaches undergraduates, I believe that one of the paramount purposes of a liberal-arts education is to help young people acquire the wisdom to escape those sins, particularly the last one from which the others often spring.\nA liberal-arts education, as I see it, is not about acquiring wealth and opportunities to further indulge one’s desires. Nor is it about cultivating in students an insular, idolatrous view of their nation, ethnic group, gender, or religion. It is also not about celebrating the so-called “great tradition” of authors, philosophers, and artists.\nIt is about the recognition, ultimately, of how little one really knows, or can know. A liberal-arts education, most of all, fights unmerited pride by asking students to recognize the smallness of their ambitions in the context of human history, and more. Whether it is grounded in faith or not, a liberal-arts education should help students to combat the Seven Deadly Sins with the “Seven Contrary Virtues” of diligence, generosity, patience, chastity, moderation, contentment, and, most important of all, humility.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOf course, moral perfection seldom arrives at graduation, even in the best of cases. I teach the courses, and yet I must present myself, at last, as the “Chief of Sinners.” The behaviors I observe in students often reflect the deeper drives -- the resentments and weaknesses -- of their teachers. Perhaps the impulse to identify the sins of others reflects a corruption more serious than any I have described here. And that is why, next month, I will sermonize on the “Seven Deadly Sins of Professors.”\nThomas H.

Miriam Posner, an associate professor of information studies at the University of California at Los Angeles, asked: “Have you ever done a ‘hidden curriculum’ session with undergrads? (That is, explaining all the things colleges assume you know but are not obvious to many people.) What did they find most helpful?”\nPosner went on to add: “On my list: the purpose of lectures relative to seminars (this turned out to be an issue last year), how to address instructors, how to write an email to a Grown Up, the purpose and method of reading for class, expectations of class attendance, perhaps notetaking…”\nIn an interview, Posner told me that she was planning to add such a session to “Data, Justice, and Society,” a cluster class — an interdisciplinary, co-taught, course for large groups of first-year students that run for three consecutive quarters — which she’s teaching for the second time next year.\nIn this year’s iteration, Posner said, she and her co-instructors found themselves having to clear up misunderstandings on points like the difference between lecture and seminar sections and how to communicate with professors late into the year. It seemed better to address these matters head on.\nIt’s worth looking at the replies to Posner’s post in full. They contain lots of good comments and suggestions — and not just for students who are new to college, either. Among them:\nSimply introducing students to the idea that there is a hidden curriculum can be freeing.\nGive them an org chart of the department, college, or university and explain who makes which decisions.\nLet them know about campus support resources.\nTeach them how to read a syllabus, why they should go to office hours, and how to send a professional email.\nTake a look, and if you have additional ideas on how to uncover the hidden curriculum, I’d love to hear them: beckie.supiano@chronicle.com\nOther resources: I wrote about a first-year course that tackles the hidden curriculum in the newsletter here. And our colleague Emma Pettit interviewed sociology professor Jessica Calarco about her book on the hidden curriculum for graduate school here.\nSummer recommendations\nTo the extent that summer was ever a respite for faculty members, we know that this has become less true in recent years. Still, we hope that this time provides some change of pace or scene and that you can use it to recharge.\nWe thought we’d use the occasion to crowdsource any books or podcasts you’d recommend to fellow Teaching readers — you can share them with me at beckie.supiano@chronicle.com, with perhaps a line or two about why you’re suggesting them.\nAnd if you’re planning to brush up on a new skill — whether teaching-related or not — over the summer, we’d be interested in hearing about that, too. As we discussed in some recent newsletter issues on helping students practice, being a beginner now and then can be very eye-opening for instructors.\nEngaging classrooms\nHere’s the bad news: Professors can no longer assume that a critical mass of students will go through the expected motions of showing up, participating, and doing their own work. Some lack foundational skills in reading and writing. But there’s also good news: We know more than ever which teaching practices have a track record of boosting engagement, and we have a better understanding of why such practices work.\nI’m looking for examples of engaging teaching practices that have been successful in a particular course. Maybe a professor has created conditions that help students connect with their classmates. Or has found a good way to show that a seemingly esoteric topic is important to their lives and future plans. Maybe an instructor has layered chances for reflection into a course.\nDo you know of — or yourself teach — a course that has fostered meaningful engagement? I’d love to hear more about it for a reporting project. Share ideas with me at beckie.supiano@chronicle.com.\nThanks for reading Teaching.

Now, she said, “I must either choose another country or give up on my academic goals.”\nThe border restrictions are the latest blow landed by the Trump administration on international education. On the same day, the president signed a proclamation freezing entry to the United States for Harvard students and scholars, an attempted end run around a federal judge’s ruling that the government could not revoke the university’s authorization to participate in the student-visa system.\nIn recent weeks, the administration has threatened to “aggressively” cancel Chinese students’ visas, terminated (and later restored) the legal status of thousands of foreign students, and suspended new student-visa interviews worldwide — at the busiest time of the year for college applicants. Collectively, the actions have left international students and American colleges reeling.\nWhile many of the directives have come as a surprise, Trump had long signaled plans to reimpose a travel ban, a policy from his first term in office. The new measure, which took effect on Monday, limits travel from an additional seven countries and specifically suspends student and scholar visas. The administration cited national-security reasons for the restrictions.\nOf the countries included in the ban, Iran is the most significant for higher education. Nearly 12,500 Iranian students currently study on American campuses, and they enroll disproportionately in graduate programs and in STEM fields, amplifying the impact of the new restrictions. The 2017 version of the ban had exempted students from Iran.\nThe latest ban applies to foreign citizens who are outside the United States and do not have a valid visa. Yet it has caused consternation among current Iranian students. Because students from Iran are typically issued a single-entry visa — most students are given visas good for the duration of their studies — the new restrictions mean that they will be barred from returning if they leave the United States.\nThe University of Massachusetts at Amherst had been planning for a potential travel ban throughout the spring and was able to quickly notify those affected, said Kalpen Trivedi, vice provost for global affairs. No current students or faculty members were stuck outside the country when the ban went into effect.\nBut supporting incoming students is another matter. UMass may be able to accommodate some undergraduate students denied entry, the largest group of which is from Myanmar, at study-abroad sites overseas, a strategy the university employed during the pandemic. Remote learning isn’t an option, however, for graduate students, in part because of federal rules governing research in certain scientific fields.\n“We’re trying to stay a step or two ahead of an unpredictable administration,” Trivedi said.\nIranian students have started a letter-writing campaign to public officials and journalists, urging that the ban be lifted or revisited. Many, like Sam, said they had not engaged in any political activity.\nSaeed had been set to start a Ph.D. program at Montana Technological University, one of two institutions that offered him full scholarships. His particular interest is in groundwater remediation, and at the American colleges, he could find professors pursuing similar research.\nSaeed hoped his work could help deal with environmental problems globally. “It is strictly scientific and nonsensitive,” he said, “with no security implications.”\nHossein had spent years studying, improving his English, and saving money to pursue a master’s degree in health care management at George Washington University. He was attracted to education in the United States because of its quality and because it offers programs that combine practical skills, policy expertise, and public service.\nGeorge Washington had deferred his admission to the spring semester, but even if the ban was removed, Hossein worried that scholarships and courses would no longer be available. He is thinking about applying to programs in Canada or Europe, but because deadlines have passed, he would need to delay his education by another year. And neither, he said, was his first choice. “Everything is on pause with no timeline or transparency.”\nBlanket restrictions based on citizenship ignore individual merit, said Hossein. “The emotional toll of being rejected not because of anything I did, but because of my nationality, is incredibly disheartening.”\nMeanwhile, Harvard won a temporary halt to the international-admissions freeze after the university amended an earlier lawsuit against the Trump administration to include the most-recent directive.\nAnd the president seemed to retreat from his administration’s plan to revoke the visas of Chinese students who had ties to the Communist Party or were studying in unnamed sensitive fields.\n“Chinese students are coming. No problem,” Trump said during a White House briefing. “It’s our honor to have them.”\nI’ll be joining The Chronicle’s free monthly webinar series on the Trump administration’s impact on higher education to talk about all the recent developments affecting international ed. To join us on Thursday, June 12, at 1 p.m. ET, register here.\nWith Trump’s help, Texas repeals undocumented-tuition law\nThe country’s oldest law offering in-state tuition to undocumented students was abruptly repealed after the Trump administration filed a lawsuit challenging Texas’ longstanding policy.\nRather the contesting the lawsuit, Texas’ attorney general, Ken Paxton, a Republican, asked a federal court to side with the federal government and declare the 24-year-old law unconstitutional. A judge then complied.\nOpponents of the policy, which permitted students without legal documentation to qualify for lower resident tuition rates, accomplished through the courts what they could not legislatively. A bill rolling back the tuition benefit stalled during the most recent legislative session.\nFlorida lawmakers this year voted to end a similar benefit. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia allow in-state tuition for undocumented students.\nCampaign emphasizes career value of study abroad\nThe Forum on Education Abroad has begun a campaign to promote the economic and career benefits of study abroad.\nThe forum, an organization of colleges and overseas-study providers, is seeking to highlight how the skills students acquire by studying, interning, or doing research abroad are relevant in the workplace. “In today’s world, being work-ready means being globally prepared,” the campaign said. Among the skills strengthened abroad are adaptability and agility, cultural intelligence, and problem-solving in complex situations.\nStudents who studied abroad said it was important for their personal and professional development. And résumés with international experience are more likely to receive a callback for an interview, studies suggest.\nMelissa Torres, the group’s president, said a goal of the campaign was “to build a bridge” between international learning and the fact that “U.S. companies increasingly value those very same skills to enable economic growth.” The forum is surveying alumni about their experiences abroad and encouraging students and alumni to write op-eds for their local newspapers.\nPreviously seen primarily as having cultural and linguistic benefits, research has increasingly shown the academic impact of education abroad, particularly for low-income and first-generation students and those from minority backgrounds. Yet relatively few American students study abroad.\nEnglish-language programs see small enrollment gains\nEnglish-language programs continued their slow rebound from the precipitous drop in enrollments during the pandemic.\nThe number of students studying at independent and college-based English-language institutes increased by 2 percent in 2024, according to a report from the Institute of International Education. In total, 69,300 students came to the United States to learn English.\nThe largest number of students in intensive-English programs were from Japan, followed by China, Brazil, and France.\nAround the globe\nThe U.S. Department of Justice charged a Chinese researcher at the University of Michigan with attempting to smuggle a “potential agroterrorism weapon” into the country. Scientists say that the fungus in widely prevalent in the United States and likely originated in North America.\nIDP Education, a major player in foreign-student recruitment, said it expects to place 30 percent fewer students because of political uncertainty in the United States and other major destination countries.\nThe Australian government is encouraging a larger share of high-school graduates to pursue vocational training, rather than a college degree.\nMalaysia will stop sending scholarship students to study in the United States because of concern about American policies affecting international students.\nA trade war with the United States could exacerbate youth unemployment in China.\nA Hungarian oil and gas company has purchased a stake in the foundation that runs Budapest University of Technology and Economics, the country’s most prestigious engineering college. The government under Viktor Orbán had effectively privatized Hungary’s public universities, stripping control away from the central Ministry of Education and giving it to boards stocked with political loyalists.\nDenmark’s prime minister wants to extend a ban on full-coverage veils in public places to colleges and schools.\nDutch universities hope that the collapse of the current government will lead to more funding for education and research.\nTrinity College Dublin will cut ties with Israeli universities in protest of “ongoing violations of international and humanitarian law” by Israel’s government.\nThanks for reading.

This week, I interview an author about his new book, which identifies four strategies eight colleges have used to try to stay afloat.\n4 Models for Solvency\nJoshua Travis Brown calls his book, Capitalizing on College: How Higher Education Went from Mission Driven to Margin Obsessed, a “scholarly novella” — which might seem like an odd label for a book that is essentially about college financial models and the relentless hunt for revenue.\nBrown, an assistant professor of entrepreneurial leadership in education at the Johns Hopkins University and a former administrator in student affairs and institutional research at Liberty University, examines the strategies of eight private, church-affiliated institutions as they adopt various models to try to raise revenue and keep their institutions solvent, amid increasing costs, more difficulty in recruiting traditional students, and the diminishing influence of their church base.\nBrown highlights four financial models that the institutions adopt, from approaches that might seem old fashioned to those that maximize profits from new markets: The “traditional strategy” depends on attracting students through the college’s academic reputation and relying on the endowment for an annual subsidy to support operations, perhaps the most precarious of the models. In the “pioneer strategy,” the institution sets up academic programs in off-site locations to capture a peripheral enrollment market, like adult students, which helps support the residential program. The “network strategy” more aggressively goes after those peripheral markets, opening up lines of business in not just adult education but also vocational programs, international locations, professional programs, and so on. Finally, Brown’s financial stepladder seems to culminate with the “accelerated strategy,” the one institution in the book that has embraced hard-nosed business practices and scale to maximize its margins — but has perhaps lost sight of its mission in the process.\nThe “scholarly novella” part comes through the stories of the people working at these institutions. Brown, who conducted about 150 interviews with administrators, staff, and faculty members on the eight campuses, changed the names and locations of the colleges in the book — higher-ed nerds might enjoy trying to piece together the identity of the institutions from the clues. But that anonymity allowed Brown’s subjects to be more candid — which makes Capitalizing on College a compelling window into how administrators are actually thinking about their institution’s evolution, and how the drive for enrollment and margins has started to contort it.\nOne administrator at “Ardmore University” — a Protestant “accelerated” institution once managed by a “family firm,” now focused on “superprofits” — admits that the university’s outsourced online program has sapped the once-core residential program. “They say they want high quality, but they’re not putting the money towards that in terms of classes. Rather than building an institution of higher learning, it feels like they’re building an empire.” Another administrator at the university calls it “a Ponzi scheme.”\nBrown’s interviews also bring out some of the comedy and heartbreak behind the struggle to keep these institutions alive. One enrollment administrator at prestigious, traditional “Boxborough College,” amid declining prospects for his institution, noted that it was completely unprepared for the nonwhite, nontraditional students it would have to recruit in the years to come. A vice president at “Havertown College,” another traditional institution, described the myopic leadership the college had in the past. “The president was about 80 at the time; he did not understand the youth that were coming to Havertown, and we were not growing,” the administrator says. “We were in a meeting, and he told us, ‘Boys, you just need to forget those computers. You need to make sure you got paper and pen because that is just a fad that’s going out!’”\nI asked Brown about what he found in his research. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nIn your examination of these colleges, what surprised you?\nWhat was completely unexpected to me were the two economic terms I actually had to create to describe this model of how a nonprofit survives. What the entrepreneurial schools in the book did was they created new markets, periphery markets, that had margins, or profits. This is a thing that we don’t talk about in higher ed — there are a lot of profits in higher education in the nonprofit sector — and we don’t often talk about what we do with those profits. These profits at these schools were coming off of tuition revenue. We all know that the residential model is not sustainable. That’s why we have endowments. But it’s not sustainable — and so online, satellite, adult-ed, and international students have subsidized American higher education for more than two decades. The term that I use to describe that is called “margin capitalization.”\nThe second big finding that I did not expect was that some schools became so good at margin capitalization that they were able to take it to scale. There’s a number of schools in the United States that run this model, and they make so much money off the margins — to the tune of $70 million, $100 million, $150 million, annually. They take that money and they completely transform the residential campus, with big buildings, amazing facilities. It’s the marginalized students that have been funding this for two decades.\nSome of these schools make so much money that in addition to pulling $100 million back to campus, they have leftovers. What they do with that is they fund their endowment. I call that “margin philanthropy.”\nYou say that this isn’t often talked about in higher education, but a number of college-finance people I know are immersed in this stuff. Maybe a number of academics don’t know how this all works?\nThat’s why it was so important for me to write this as a story. This needed to be a scholarly novella, so the average person who saw a fairly good-looking cover and was concerned about higher education could pick it up and learn, in story form, how the sausage was made. You and your colleagues do have a firm grasp on this, but most in academia — and anybody signing a student loan now or in the past 20 years — should read this book if they want to understand why we’re in the present crisis.\nCompetition is the driving factor in your book. Do you see its overall effect as deleterious, or making the sector stronger?\nThe way it has been framed, competition will bring about quality because it will allow the students to shop — and the assumption is students will always shop for quality. It’s a great sound bite, and it mobilizes people to pick up articles or whatever. But in practice, when you incentivize students to shop, to act in self-interest, you also incentivize the institutions to act in self-interest. If we’re going to agree that the best way to organize a system of higher education is to push that down to the level of the individual, you have to account for the actions that are going to take place at the level of the organization, and that’s what we have not done as a society. We’ve focused on feds, we’ve focused on students, and yet we’ve not gone inside these institutions to take a look at the impact of our policies.\nIs there a structure that would work better than pushing this competition down to the bottom?\nI think we need to question what we’ve told ourselves for 20 to 30 years, that if we give the customer greater choice, they’re going to always look for quality. Mmm, maybe not so much.\nWe’re going to have to get our heads around philanthropy’s role in this. Fundamentally, we have failed, as leaders, as a society, in structuring a system that leaves the individual in a better place on the back end of the system. Why the hell do you think society is revolting right now, when an individual comes out with $50,000 to $100,000 in student loans and they can’t get ahead? Because on the front end, they bought into a narrative.\nTo some extent, if you look at areas around the campuses — whether you’re talking about the corporate partners in foodservice or housing, or the chain stores and restaurants populating the modern college town — everyone is looking at the student as a source of revenue.\nYes, because there are margins in higher education, and we need to do a better job of talking about those margins. One discussion I had with a university president about Sodexo: He said, I really wrestled with the Sodexo contract because we’re a Catholic campus, we believe in social justice, so what we decided was that we were going to allow Sodexo to come in, but they had to pay the minimum wage set by our institution. They were one of the top three highest paying campuses for Sodexo workers nationally and it was a mission-guided standard. That’s where that tension between mission and margin comes in. Leaders just have to grapple with it every step along the way.\nHow has competition and drive toward growth promoted the spending on nonacademic functions and priorities overall, and to what extent are these other things driving the costs up?\nHigher education is an asset-heavy institution. These leaders in the book understood that in luring a student, there’s an information asymmetry. A client or a customer comes onto campus and goes, Huh, I don’t know a whole lot about what’s occurring in the classroom, but the buildings look nice. And if the buildings look nice, the education here must be nice. And so buildings and the campus function as a signal of quality. One university president at another Catholic college deliberately built the graduate campuses on the periphery or in shopping centers in various parts of town – if you had to go to the medical graduate campus, it was over there. That president said, I’m always looking for various locations to build some of our periphery programs, because if those programs ever start to dwindle or decline in enrollment, those are the ones that I can sell off quickly. I found it ingenious. But some of the private third-party housing and the bigger buildings, those are heavy sunk costs.\nAcademic programs aren’t all that agile, either. Isn’t that part of the cost issue? What would make the academic side more agile?\nSchools that take three or four years to create and roll out a program are just going to struggle in this environment. Faculty need to come to the table, not just with their critical minds, but also with a solution. That’s what has shocked me in my move from administration to faculty — the critical nature of the faculty and the lack of solutions that many of my colleagues will propose will continue to cripple institutions whose leaders want to be innovative. In the book, I talk about two academic towers: One goes from the bottom up, and these are sort of your stable traditional programs. And then there are other programs that a president or vice president creates, that actually report directly to the president, and they operate top-down — they can be an overseas satellite market or online, but they’re developed quickly with the oversight of the president.\nThinking from an organizational standpoint, this isn’t actually foreign to higher education. It’s just foreign to those places that report to the provost. Most Division 1 athletic programs report directly to the president, and because presidents know that if you mess that up — especially those that are running in the power four conferences — you’re done. If it’s revenue-generating and quick decisions need to be made, I would argue that adept leaders know that those decisions cannot be bogged down by faculty who are not coming to the table with solutions.\nDo colleges really have to follow this stepladder trajectory toward getting bigger that you lay out in Capitalizing on College? Is there room for staying small and focusing on the educational mission?\nBasically, the book starts with the traditional model that is sort of governed by elites — you have an endowment and a residential campus. You use the revenues off the endowment to subsidize the campus and you try to climb in the rankings. Well, when I arrive on campus for these interviews, the leaders are saying this model isn’t working. They’re trying to form a new model, and these are the other three strategies in the book. You do not have to follow one step after the other. In fact, one chief information officer at one of the schools said he wanted his college to leapfrog to a scaled model. I don’t think everybody needs to look like a Southern New Hampshire or an Arizona State. There are other schools out there that may be able to form other revenue streams — for example, let’s just take a look at Paul Quinn College. Paul Quinn is starting to figure out alternate revenue streams to bring into the organization. If you look lately, they’re starting to bring in businesses and organizations on to campus. They’re actually starting to look like a multinational corporation.\nAgain, we have built a model that isn’t sustainable. It requires some type of subsidy, whether it comes from business, student loans, the state, or the feds. Or look at the Brigham Young University campuses — all three of their campuses are subsidized by the LDS Church and every year, all three campuses make the lists for the most cost-effective or the lowest cost of tuition, because the LDS Church is subsidizing the cost of that residential model. So I think if schools are going to choose to stay small, they’re going to have to figure out those alternate revenue forms in order to move forward financially.\nIf competition is a driving factor causing all of these intended and unintended consequences, what is the future for more cooperation?\nWe’re going to have to figure out cooperation. Is it cooperation from religious traditions or value traditions — like the NAACP and HBCUs? There are a bunch of tuition-driven institutions — historically Black institutions, Hispanic-serving institutions, women’s institutions — that could also partner with associations. Another potential source of support is industry. Maybe one of the inter-institutional partnerships isn’t so much across colleges, but maybe it’s Apple or Microsoft and colleges in a way that starts to tackle that philanthropy question. Are these companies willing to invest in the workforce necessary to sustain those technological innovations moving forward?\nAnother thing that I would like to see colleges also improve on is attention to vocational partnerships, to the extent that we believe as a society that it is beneficial for an HVAC technician not to just have the technical training, but to have four or five core courses that we believe as a society these individuals need to function as good citizens — democratic values, a knowledge of all religions, pluralism, whatever it might be. But for some reason, colleges have stiff-armed the vocational training. A few institutions are starting to dip their toes in. That’s where we need to look for innovation on the horizon.\nWant to read more?\nGot a tip you’d like to share or a question you’d like me to answer? Let me know at scott.carlson@chronicle.com.

In higher education, money shapes ambition, sustains institutions, and influences tough choices. For example, federal funding can fuel research and community impact, but potential cuts may threaten an institution’s role as a local anchor. Conversely, budget shortfalls can force universities to cut programs, staff, and even entire departments. Money also reflects values, as stagnant faculty salaries often lag behind industry growth. Despite being a “made-up thing,” money profoundly shapes higher education’s future.\nProfessors Say They Need a Raise.

Staying informed about this shifting environment, and differentiating between passing fads and long-term structural changes, is critical to understanding your institution’s strategy and to making strategic decisions for your library.\nJoin us for this 60-minute session to discuss key trends in higher education and its economic and policy context.\nIn this session, you will learn:\nHow declining public trust and increasing political intervention are affecting the priorities and structure of higher education institutions.\nHow higher education institutions are adapting to a shifting enrollment and budgetary landscape.\nStrategies for equitably serving the emerging majority of students who are older, working, have earned credits elsewhere, or are from minority or lower-income backgrounds.\nHow higher education institutions are responding to new technologies and a growing emphasis on sub-degree credentials.\nMartin Kurzweil\nPanelist\nMartin Kurzweil is Vice President of the Educational Transformation Program at Ithaka S+R, which studies and supports the implementation of practices, policies, and innovations that improve student postsecondary access and success.\nCatharine Bond Hill\nPanelist\nManaging Director, Ithaka S+R\nSeminar\nUnderstanding the Higher-Ed Business Model\n01:00 PM, July 15, 2025\nAs colleges explore different strategies to achieve a sustainable future, it is essential for library leaders to understand their institution’s financial context.\nWhat is a discount rate? Where does most of a college’s revenue come from? What is an institution’s greatest expense? For many campus and library leaders, the financial realities of their institution as a whole–and the sustainability of its operations--are not often on their radar. To lead a library strategically, understanding the mounting financial pressures facing campuses, whether from falling enrollment, decreased public funding, and constraints on tuition increases, is increasingly important.\nIn this session, you will learn:\nThe financial fundamentals of different kinds of institutions\nHow external pressures are reshaping institutional finances\nThe most common financial strategies colleges pursue and how they affect academic departments\nLiz McMillen\nModerator\nAs contributing editor at The Chronicle, Liz McMillen brings more than 30 years of experience covering higher education. She is a sought-after speaker who frequently addresses college leaders in the United States and overseas about big-picture trends in higher education.\nRobert Kelchen\nPanelist\nProfessor and Department Head, Department of Educational Leadership and Policy Studies, University of Tennessee, Knoxville\nSeminar\nAcademic Libraries and Artificial Intelligence\n01:00 PM, July 16, 2025\nThe rapid spread of generative AI has led to widespread calls for integrating artificial intelligence AI (AI) into libraries’ everyday work. Within research libraries, potential applications for AI span both user-facing and backend applications. As libraries have unique expertise in the information environment, and are key providers of instruction on research methods and research integrity, libraries bear an increased role in helping their campus constituents understand the opportunities and risks of AI as integrated into the research process. Applications utilizing AI, including within cataloging and metadata enhancement, are also being more widely adopted by libraries to streamline their work.\nThis seminar will familiarize participants in areas in which AI is making impacts within libraries. As this topic is evolving quickly, the workshop will focus on tangible examples in use today, and how libraries have upskilled staff to be ready to meet new challenges in this area.\nIn this session, you will learn about:\nAI literacy: evolving definitions of AI literacy, what this means for library staff who support teaching and research, and the considerations of AI usage in academic environments\nThe library as incubator: how libraries can partner with other university units to support AI integration for students and faculty on campus, and how the library can lead discussions around the ethical consideration of usage.\nEnhancing workflows: how AI tools have been put into practice by libraries, and areas for which new technologies can enhance workflows and productivity.\nLeo Lo\nDean and Professor, College of University Libraries and Learning Sciences, The University of New Mexico\nSeminar\nThe Library Leading Through Innovation\n01:00 PM, July 17, 2025\nIn today’s rapidly evolving educational landscape, it is crucial for academic library leaders to understand and actively drive the role of libraries to pioneer institutional success. As stewards of knowledge and innovation, library leaders are uniquely positioned to influence and expand the library’s impact across research, teaching, and student success domains.\nBy strategically aligning library services and resources with the broader goals of their institutions, leaders can demonstrate the library’s integral role on campus. This proactive approach not only reinforces the library’s value but also ensures its continued relevance and resilience in the face of digital transformation and changing academic needs. Effective leadership in academic libraries, therefore, is essential not just for the success of the library itself but for the institution as a whole, as it empowers the library to become a central hub for academic and community innovation.\nIn this session, you will learn:\nThe key strategic priorities of the institution and the ways in which the library contributes to those priorities\nHow to align the goals of the library to the goals of the institution\nNew areas, such as engagement in digital scholarship, generative AI, research partnerships, and teaching collaborations where libraries are making impact within their institutions\nAssessment of libraries’ impact and communication of their role and value\nAmy Kautzman\nDean and Director, University Library, California State University, Sacramento\nWorkshop\nChange Management for Libraries\nJuly 21 or 22, 2025\nThis interactive workshop provides professionals with practical tools and frameworks for navigating organizational change. The session will explore the challenges organizations face during transformation, regardless of the drivers. Participants will engage in activities and discussions that highlight the dynamics of change and build confidence in addressing resistance while supporting teams.\nThrough a combination of presentations, group discussions, exercises, and practices, participants will deepen their understanding of how to lead or support change effectively within their organizations. They will work through change scenarios using planning tools. By the end of the session, attendees will gain actionable steps and clarity about how to lead with resilience and adaptability in a continually evolving landscape.\nAttendees who participate in this workshop will:\nIdentify common challenges and dynamics associated with organizational change and transformation.\nApply practical tools and frameworks to analyze and plan for change within their organizational context.\nDemonstrate strategies for addressing resistance and supporting teams through periods of transition.\nDevelop a personalized action plan to lead or support change with resilience and adaptability\nSession options:\nJuly 21, 1 - 3:30 p.m. ET\nJuly 22, 1 - 3:30 p.m. ET\nAlicia Salaz\nVice Provost and University Librarian, University of Oregon\nWorkshop\nActive Collection Management for Contemporary Libraries\nJuly 23, 2025\nWith decreasing or flatlining budgets, many academic libraries are making difficult decisions about collection resource allocations. In conjunction with reallocated budgets, libraries are also reevaluating traditional collection development practices, including item selection, approval plans, and demand-driven acquisitions. These issues need thoughtful examination to be more inclusive of contemporary student and researcher needs as well as reflective of the new fiscal reality.\nThis workshop aims to prepare participants for active collection management oversight by understanding new practices and tools to make better informed choices about collections management and growth. The workshop will focus on how collecting opportunities and practices have changed in recent years, and the resulting effects for libraries and their users.\nParticipants will advance knowledge in the following areas:\nVendor relationships: Participants will learn how to cultivate and maintain effective relationships with vendors to maximize the resources available to their institutional community.\nAcquisitions models: Participants will understand the effectiveness and strength of acquisitions models including traditional item level selection, demand-driven acquisition (DDA), evidence-based acquisition (EBA), and purchasing complete collections.\nConsortial collecting: Participants will hear about successful initiatives of consortial or collective collecting, and what institutions gain from these partnerships.\nNew opportunities: Participants will learn about new opportunities for collections growth, including through support of open access and open educational resources initiatives.\nAssessment: Participants will understand metrics that can be used to measure return on investment of their collection, and how they can be utilized to create an informed and data-driven collections growth strategy.\nSession options:\nJuly 23, 9 - 11:30 a.m. ET\nJuly 23, 1 - 3:30 p.m. ET\nJessica Morales\nAssociate Dean for Collections and Open Initiatives, University of Arkansas\nWorkshop\nThe Library’s Role in Student Learning\nJuly 24, 2025\nParticipants will engage with a library leader who has a proven track record of implementing strategies to enhance services and that support student learning at their institution. In this session participants will learn how libraries are uniquely qualified to enhance student learning by serving as hubs for innovation, critical inquiry, and academic support. As generative AI tools like large language models (LLMs) become embedded in higher education, libraries can take the lead in helping students understand how these tools work, how to use them ethically, and how to develop core skills such as prompt engineering and critical evaluation.\nDuring the session, participants will also engage with examples of how libraries can serve as essential partners to faculty in rethinking assessment. As traditional assignments become increasingly vulnerable to AI misuse, librarians can collaborate with instructors to redesign coursework in ways that emphasize inquiry, iteration, and authenticity. From integrating reflective writing on the use of AI to scaffolded research assignments that prioritize the learning process, libraries bring both instructional design insight and a deep understanding of student needs to the table.\nBeyond AI and assignment support, libraries continue to play a vital role in advancing student learning through a variety of services: they provide inclusive study environments tailored to different learning opportunities, foster information and digital literacy across disciplines, and curate resources that ensure all students—regardless of background—can succeed academically. Whether by supporting undergraduate research, offering multimedia creation spaces, or mentoring students in source evaluation and citation practices, libraries remain central to the intellectual and personal growth of the students they serve.\nSession options:\nJuly 24, 9 - 11:30 a.m. ET\nJuly 24, 1 - 3:30 p.m. ET\nRegister for the Workshop Program\nExplore Content\nLatest News\nNewsletters\nLetters\nFree Reports and Guides\nProfessional Development\nVirtual Events\nChronicle Store\nChronicle Intelligence\nJobs in Higher Education\nPost a Job\nKnow The Chronicle\nAbout Us\nVision, Mission, Values\nDEI at The Chronicle\nWrite for Us\nWork at The Chronicle\nOur Reporting Process\nAdvertise With Us\nBrand Studio\nAccessibility Statement\nAccount and Access\nManage Your Account\nManage Newsletters\nIndividual Subscriptions\nGroup and Institutional Access\nSubscription & Account FAQ\nGet Support\nContact Us\nReprints & Permissions\nUser Agreement\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nCalifornia Privacy Policy\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n1255 23rd Street, N.W.

Old ways are crumbling as value proposition is increasingly questioned in public discourse, especially amid a climate of financial scarcity and political turbulence. Student needs are changing, and the ways that people work together are transforming. With these factors influencing a declining level of trust between faculty and administration, collaboration in shared governance is suffering more than ever.\nThe Chronicle and Teibel Education Consulting have developed a virtual professional-development program to help administrative leaders overcome this trust gap by developing skills and sensibilities related to interpersonal collaboration. Over the course of two weeks, participants will have the opportunity to transform their practice of shared governance through collaborative workshops and guided exercises on learning how to make tough decisions, leading with resiliency, and building high-performing teams and organizations.\nPlease reach out to workshops@chronicle.com with any questions you may have about registration.\nRegister\nProgram Leaders\nHoward Teibel\nPresident\nTeibel Education Consulting\nMary Herbert\nSenior Consultant and Principal Coach\nTeibel Education Consulting\nLiz McMillen\nContributing Editor\nThe Chronicle of Higher Education\nTestimonials for The Administrative Leadership Institute\nAn excellent crash course to begin the planning process for accelerating change on your campus.

Please reach out to workshops@chronicle.com for details.\nSpecial Focus for 2025\nOur focus in this program is oriented to navigating in these difficult times. As institutions navigate budgetary constraints, new federal mandates, and the evolving landscape of higher education, the need for strong, adaptable leadership has never been greater. In an era of heightened polarization, administrators must also make challenging decisions that balance legal compliance with deeply held values, which requires refining our leadership approach.\nFor these reasons, we’ve enhanced our core curriculum for 2025 with the following key themes:\nCrisis Leadership and Decision-Making: Strengthen leadership skills to navigate financial uncertainty, make data-informed decisions, and communicate effectively with stakeholders during times of fiscal challenge.\nDemonstrate Strategic Leadership in Financially Challenging Times: Strengthen leadership capabilities to guide institutions through economic uncertainty by making strategic, mission-driven financial decisions that balance short-term needs with long-term sustainability.\nEnhance Communication and Influence for Financial Advocacy: Develop the ability to effectively communicate financial realities, mobilize support from key stakeholders, and advocate for resources in a way that builds trust and alignment across campus communities.\nLead Teams with Resilience and Adaptability: Cultivate resilience and adaptability as a leader by fostering a positive, solution-focused mindset among faculty, staff, and administrators in the face of budget constraints and organizational change.\nManage Organizational Change and Innovation Under Pressure: Apply change management strategies to lead teams through financial restructuring, process optimization, and new revenue-generating initiatives while maintaining morale and institutional effectiveness.\nFoster a Culture of Transparency, Collaboration, and Accountability: Strengthen management skills to create an open, accountable decision-making process that encourages collaboration, empowers teams, and aligns financial strategies with institutional values and goals.\nWorkshop\nDay One: Navigating Shared Governance Culture\nEven the most experienced leaders can have difficulty collaborating with other leaders at their institution to jump start progress on important initiatives.\nIn this four-hour workshop intensive, program facilitators will break down how to navigate the culture of shared governance and introduce how to effectively manage commitments through the use of intentional language. Through interactive discussions, live polls, and break-out sessions, the learning goals for this session will include:\nHow to collaborate using a different common sense to strengthen your institution’s ability to get things done\nHow to effectively use language to make requests with clear conditions of satisfaction\nHow to recognize and cultivate mood to boost productivity\nWorkshop\nDay Two: Creating a Culture of Commitment\nOnce a leader can talk the talk in their role, the next step is walking the walk: implementing effective leadership skills to elevate the culture and success of their division and institution.\nIn this five-hour workshop intensive, participants will explore how to own the authority that has been granted to them as a leader and learn ways to positively leverage their influence to increase trust and encourage action. Through interactive discussions and breakout sessions, the learning outcomes for this session will include:\nHow to clearly assess trust using four lenses\nHow to mobilize individuals and teams by making declarations\nHow to exercise your power to disagree and commit\nThis session will also include a thought-provoking panel discussion with academic and administrative leaders, focused on real-world examples and outcomes of collaboration and shared governance.\nWorkshop\nCapstone Event\nParticipants from the program will be invited to a networking capstone event in the months following the program to reconvene with peers, evaluate the progress made towards their commitments, and to share best practices they have learned for the path forward.\nRegister\nThe Mission of The Administrative Leadership Institute\nFrom the beginning, The Administrative Leadership Institute was designed to help staff leaders in higher education navigate uncertainty. As the uncertainty has grown and evolved over the past year, the skills and sensibilities at the core of the program have never been more important. Liz McMillen sat down with Howard Teibel to discuss the turbulent landscape institutions are facing, and the leadership capabilities that are vital to staying afloat and moving institutional initiatives forward.\nExplore Content\nLatest News\nNewsletters\nLetters\nFree Reports and Guides\nProfessional Development\nVirtual Events\nChronicle Store\nChronicle Intelligence\nJobs in Higher Education\nPost a Job\nKnow The Chronicle\nAbout Us\nVision, Mission, Values\nDEI at The Chronicle\nWrite for Us\nWork at The Chronicle\nOur Reporting Process\nAdvertise With Us\nBrand Studio\nAccessibility Statement\nAccount and Access\nManage Your Account\nManage Newsletters\nIndividual Subscriptions\nGroup and Institutional Access\nSubscription & Account FAQ\nGet Support\nContact Us\nReprints & Permissions\nUser Agreement\nTerms and Conditions\nPrivacy Policy\nCalifornia Privacy Policy\nDo Not Sell My Personal Information\n1255 23rd Street, N.W.

White can include faculty members of North African or Middle Eastern ethnicity.

A person may be counted in only one of these groups. Percentages may not add up to 100 due to rounding.\n“Total minority” is the percentage of all faculty members who are nonwhite and whose race is known. As noted above, this value would not include faculty of North African or Middle Eastern descent. It includes those who are two or more races; it does not include “nonresident aliens” as their ethnicity or race is unknown.\nSome colleges reported a large number of their faculty members in the “race/ethnicity unknown” category. In those cases, all of the other figures should be interpreted with caution. However, some studies indicate that many people reported in that column are white but chose not to identify their race. If that is true, the percentages shown for racial minorities would tend to be accurate.\nType categories are from the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. Values for 2021 through 2023 use the 2021 groupings, while earlier years use the 2018 classifications. Groups are the same across these two sets, but institutions may have moved to a new group between the 2018 and 2021 versions. “Special focus” includes both two-year and four-year special-focus institutions. “Associate” also includes those institutions classified as “baccalaureate/associate.”\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

But a new analysis from the College and University Professional Association for Human Resources sheds light on how these dynamics play out by discipline. The report charts pay, growth, and hiring trends across 29 academic disciplines over a 20-year span. The Chronicle focused on 10 of the largest disciplines for this analysis.\nWhile the data paint a pessimistic picture for salaries and the attainability of tenure across the board, they do highlight a few fields — including business, health-care, and STEM fields — that have fared relatively well in terms of pay and growth. Education, meanwhile, has struggled: It experienced the highest percentage drop in salaries among The Chronicle‘s subset and was the only field to have fewer faculty members in the 2023-24 academic year than in 2003-04.\nNo discipline saw salaries keep up with inflation during the period CUPA-HR studied, which included both pandemic-driven cuts to pay and jobs as well as the markedly high levels of inflation that followed. Median pay for just three disciplines — business, health professions, and biological and biomedical sciences — had single-digit percentage drops between 2003 and 2023 when adjusted for inflation, while faculty members in education and computer science endured declines of 13 percent.\nWith the largest increase in median salary, business remained the gold standard for pay. It’s been among the top four highest-paid disciplines in each of the past 20 years and the single highest-paid discipline for the past nine years, a trend the CUPA-HR researchers attribute in part to stiff competition with the private sector for doctoral-degree holders.\nWhile engineering and computer science were the disciplines closest to keeping pace with business salaries, they were also among the disciplines in which hiring flagged most last year. Only 14 and 17 percent of institutions, respectively, reported having hired an assistant professor in those fields during the 2023-24 academic year, whereas more than a quarter of institutions said they’d added an assistant professor in business. (The CUPA-HR researchers point out that the high demand for business faculty members correlates with the popularity of business as an undergraduate major in recent years.)\nThe CUPA data also illustrate the shift away from tenure-track staffing in the past decade. In 2013-14, just two of the 10 disciplines whose data The Chronicle analyzed had more than a quarter of faculty members not on the tenure track. But by 2023-24, that trend had reversed: Only two disciplines reported that less than a quarter of faculty members were non-tenure-track. Health professions was an outlier, having started with a much higher proportion of non-tenure-track faculty members than other disciplines. In 2023-24, that proportion ballooned to 61 percent.\nNine of the 10 fields The Chronicle analyzed boasted more faculty members in 2023-24 than in 2003-04, with education being the exception. During a similar period, bachelor’s programs in these disciplines (including education) also grew, according to a Chronicle analysis last year.\nHealth professions more than doubled its faculty ranks in that 20-year span, which the CUPA-HR researchers note indicates an emphasis on academic programs with clear career paths and high demand in the work force. (Those new jobs are largely off the tenure track.)\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

Furlong and Stacy M.

It can be a productive source of professional support in your life, a complete interpersonal disaster, or anywhere in between. And no topic of conversation between adviser and advisee is more potentially fraught than one about Ph.D. career options.\nIt is easy to understand why. Compared with most professional relationships outside of academe, faculty advisers have far more power over their graduate students’ careers. The adviser/advisee connection is often much more personal than that of boss and employee, and may feature little oversight. All of those factors, taken together, mean that it can feel very risky to tell your adviser that you plan to deviate from the expected career path in your field.\nGraduate students worry about disappointing their advisers in any number of ways. But when it comes to the job search, you may be stressed about revealing that you:\nPlan to seek both industry and academic jobs.\nDon’t want to pursue a tenure-track search at all.\nHave decided not to do a postdoc, particularly if you are in a STEM field.\nHave declined a tenure-track offer.\nHave accepted an industry job offer.\nPlan to accept a nonacademic job offer without completing your Ph.D.\nJorge Cham, an “engineer turned cartoonist,” illustrated this dilemma in one of his Ph.D. Comics that describes the differences between “the plan you tell your adviser,” the “real plan,” and the “secret plan.”\nPh.D. students often feel compelled to make their career plans in secret. As experts on graduate-career counseling, we both believe that the benefits of being honest with your adviser are worth the risk (in most cases). By being open, the two of you can:\nDiscuss your research more productively in light of your actual career plans.\nHelp you take advantage of professional opportunities that may require a letter of recommendation or a sign off from your adviser.\nLeverage your adviser’s network in ways that are most useful to you.\nNot waste time on things that you know won’t be helpful to your career plan.\nAnd finally, the sense of well-being that comes from not feeling as though you have to lie about your nonacademic search or sneak around doing industry interviews can’t be underestimated.\nThere is, in our experience, a high likelihood that the conversation will go better than you expect, especially if you prepare for it. Here’s how.\nWhen should we talk about careers? This conversation is worth having at any point in your graduate career. Discussing your interest in multiple career options early on means that your adviser won’t be surprised or taken aback by your decisions at the end of the program. It also means that you can take advantage of opportunities that come your way with your adviser’s full knowledge and consent.\nADVERTISEMENT\nBut the timing of this conversation may also depend on how committed you are to the tenure-track path. Some students enter Ph.D. programs already knowing that they will not pursue faculty roles. For them, being upfront about those intentions means the freedom to choose an adviser and committee members, and plan their time in the program, with an eye toward their ultimate goal.\nOther students enter graduate school convinced that they want to be a professor — and change their minds. Or they realize they would only be interested in a faculty career in particular locations or at certain types of institutions and, therefore, need to plan an alternative pathway. If you fall into one of those camps, aim to have the career conversation with your adviser in the middle of your doctoral program, around the third or fourth year. That still leaves plenty of time to explore career options, expand your network, and even undertake a dissertation that would support your interest in a nonacademic career.\nHow do I tell my adviser? What should I say? That will depend on your particular mix of reasons for wanting to run a tandem job search (for both faculty and industry jobs) or only pursue careers outside of academe. Here are some ways to phrase your explanation:\n“The academic market being what it is, I want to ensure that I have options as I finish my program.”\n“I’ve been learning about nonfaculty careers for Ph.D.s, and I’m really excited about [fill in the blank].”\n“Finding a tenure-track position is my first choice, but I know I can’t do short-term or adjunct positions forever. I want to make sure I have paths to more stable employment.”\n“I want/need control over where I live, so I’m going to pursue both academic and industry jobs in the area.”\n“I’ve learned that academe might not be the best fit for me. I want to finish my degree, but I’m going to explore a range of career options for when I finish.”\nWhatever your reasoning, explain it as calmly and confidently as possible. Practice the conversation, if you need to, with a trusted friend, partner, or family member. And resist the urge to apologize for your choices. Making decisions that feel right about your own future is not something you need to apologize for.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhat kind of reaction should I expect? Once you tell your adviser that you will be (also or only) looking for industry jobs, the most common response will be support, coupled with confusion about next steps. Most faculty members know the tenure-track market but have little or no expertise in nonacademic careers. Your adviser may say something like, “You should do what is best for you, but I don’t know how to help you on the industry front.”\nSo it’s a good idea to spend some time thinking about exactly what it is that you want your adviser to do after this conversation. Among the possibilities:\nNothing, just yet. Maybe, at this point, you merely want your adviser to be aware of your career goals and aspirations.\nConnect you with former students who are working outside of higher education.\nKeep an eye out for opportunities you might be interested in, such as internships, workshops, and training programs.\nAllow you to take time away from your doctoral work to apply for and attend those internships, workshops, and training programs.\nWork with you to design a dissertation that supports your professional goals.\nWill your adviser try to talk you out of an industry search? Probably not. But your professor may try to reassure you that your scholarship is, indeed, good enough for you to pursue an academic career, if you chose to do so. Thank your adviser for their kind words but make clear that a lack of confidence in your own research isn’t why you are pursuing a career outside of higher ed. Don’t let praise dissuade you from pursuing your own goals.\nADVERTISEMENT\nFinally, your adviser may express disappointment, which can be really hard to hear. Doctoral students tend to be high achievers who want to live up to other people’s expectations — especially those of someone whose intellectual work they admire.\nTry to reframe your adviser’s dismay. Make it less about you and more about a misalignment between the adviser’s expectations and your goals. Good advisers, disappointed though they may be, will deal with those feelings themselves. If their disappointment begins to feel burdensome, or becomes an ongoing source of anxiety, you might think of this as practice in setting boundaries. Consider the advice of Oliver Burkeman who, in his newsletter, The Imperfectionist, calls it “a critical life skill” to “get better at disappointing people.” He notes: “It’s never your job to spare someone the experience of disappointment, provided that the action that triggers it is, in other ways, the right one to take.” You cannot please everyone all of the time, and your life is your own.\nWhat do I do if the conversation goes badly? Ultimately, you cannot control your adviser’s reaction — or overreaction, as the case may be. Here are some things you can do:\nHave a trusted friend or loved one ready to debrief with you about the experience.\nGive your adviser some time and space to think about what you’ve revealed. Some people may react poorly in the moment but eventually come around.\nSet up a meeting with another faculty member you trust to get advice on how to proceed.\nDepending on where you are in your program, the politics of your department, and the structure of your funding, you may want to consider changing advisers. We don’t suggest that you do this hastily, but if things get ugly, it may be your best option.\nWhen is it OK to keep my industry career goals from my adviser? Only you can really judge your relationship with your mentor. If you feel that it would be truly detrimental to your career to share your decision with your adviser — and you are not in a position to change to a more supportive one — then it is OK to decide not to say anything. At some point, your career path will become obvious — if, for example, you decide not to go on the academic job market at all or decide to only apply to a handful of jobs. Steel yourself for what may be a very difficult conversation.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTo be clear: We do not recommend going on the academic job market just to please your adviser. Nor do we advise hiding your true career plans. The academic job market requires an incredible investment of time and energy — from both you and your adviser. Don’t go on the tenure-track market just to avoid a tough conversation.\nDon’t hesitate to seek support if the adviser-advisee relationship is causing you a lot of stress. One often overlooked resource for managing your relationship with your adviser is your university’s mental-health services. A trained counselor can help you unpack what might be happening with your adviser — the communication habits that you bring to the relationship and how you might change your approach to make these conversations more productive. A counselor can also help you strategize difficult conversations.\nIn our experience, the vast majority of faculty advisers want their advisees to succeed and live good lives. Sometimes advisers make assumptions about what success looks like, based on how it has historically been defined in the professoriate. Sometimes they forget just how variable people’s ideas of what constitutes a good life are. Yes, these career discussions can feel personal and dicey, but honesty is generally better than deception for any relationship, as is the assumption of good intent.\nAnd if you are a faculty member reading this, wondering what you can do to encourage your own students to be candid about their career goals, here’s our advice:\nDon’t assume that your students came to graduate school for the same reasons you did.\nAsk questions about what they want from their careers and be open to a range of answers.\nBe willing to help when you can. Turn your excellent research skills toward investigating career resources to help guide your advisees.\nHelp them take advantage of opportunities that come their way.\nSwallow your “disappointment” and, as much as possible, express support and enthusiasm.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

Self-promotion may feel awkward, but it’s not about selling you so much as helping to ensure your book reaches its intended audience. As the author, you are the expert. No one is better poised to spread the word and connect with readers.\nScholarly books are written to shape conversations and have an impact both in particular fields and the wider world. At its best, so-called self-promotion — whether posting on Bluesky, giving a traditional academic talk at a conference, or pitching an opinion piece to a major newspaper — means getting to share ideas, build relationships, and celebrate your hard-won accomplishments.\nIn my experience as an acquisition editor, while there is no one-size-fits-all model, promotion is most effective when started early and kept up consistently. Here are eight tips to help you develop a marketing strategy that’s right for you and your project.\nNo. 1: Know who your audience is. Academic presses will expect some discussion of your book’s “market” or “audience” in your book proposal. With which fields do you engage? Does your book have the potential to be used in the college classroom and, if so, in which courses? What level is it pitched to — undergraduate or graduate students? Will it appeal to general-interest readers? There’s a lot of buzz now about publishers wanting books with “crossover” appeal — i.e., the potential to reach readers outside of academe. I mean, sure, what publisher (or writer, for that matter) wouldn’t want that? It’s important, though, to be both realistic and specific.\nAcquisitions editors want to see that you have a practical understanding of who your audience is. In his new book on academic writing, Leonard Cassuto recommends aiming for “the field next door” instead of some phantom public. I encourage writers to think in terms of concentric circles. Who are your primary, secondary, and tertiary readers? Maybe your project takes an ecocritical approach to Victorian poetry and you want to engage scholars in the environmental humanities more broadly. Or perhaps your book is on diversity in higher ed and you’re hoping to reach not only fellow researchers but also administrators and practitioners. Or maybe you’re writing about a popular figure and you’re hoping to appeal to their fans.\nRemember: Acquisitions editors are seldom specialists in the areas in which we publish. Your book proposal is an opportunity both to tell us who you want to reach and to show us that you can effectively convey your argument to nonspecialists with some baseline curiosity or knowledge about the subject.\nNo. 2: Build an “author platform.” Devoney Looser, aka the “Jane Austen professor,” has a great 2018 Chronicle piece encouraging scholars to set aside their squeamishness about “selling” their work and create an author platform, which she calls “a plan to reach a broader audience, within or beyond academe.” Jane Friedman, an expert on the “business of being a writer” and an important resource for Looser, defines “author platform” as your visibility — to your target audience — as an authority (and, in more commercial terms, as “an ability to sell books because of who you are and who you can reach”).\nGiving papers regularly at your home field’s annual conference, writing a Substack newsletter, publishing reviews of other people’s books on germane topics — all of those can be a means of building your platform by establishing your credentials among your intended audience. I could have a wildly popular YouTube channel, but if it’s devoted to funny cat videos, it won’t help much if I’m trying to find a publisher for a book on Marxism — unless the book is Marx for Cats. The point is: Your author platform should be a logical extension of your work. Looser stresses this, too: You need to be visible to the right people.\nIf you’re hoping to publish a book, now is the time to take stock: What are you already doing in the spaces where you want to find an audience? And what are you planning to do to further establish yourself? Think about the media you read, watch, and listen to for news about books in and around your field. Start making a list now of places — journals, podcasts, event series — where you’d most like your book to be reviewed or discussed. Think about where you know people — and where the people you know know people.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNo. 3: Use social media. If you’re on social media, use it regularly. The number of followers you have on X or Bluesky may not readily convert to sales (if only!), but promotion on social media does have an impact. The University of Chicago Press has some fantastic guidelines for authors on how to approach different sites such as Instagram, Wikipedia, or GoodReads.\nWhile some scholars are wary of posting about their book project until they have a publishing contract in hand, others use social media as a source of support throughout the writing process. You won’t get much of a reaction if you wait until your book is out to create a social-media account or revive a long-dormant one. Instead, use your social media to offer highlights along the way: when your cover is finalized, when you get blurbs (aka endorsements), when it becomes available for preorder (ideally with a link to your publisher’s website rather than to Amazon). And keep sharing once the book is published: if you’re giving a talk about it, if your publisher is running a sale.\nNo. 4: Or don’t use social media. As Looser noted in her 2018 essay, “most effective author-platform strategies involve social media,” and that remains true even though the online scene has changed a lot since then. We now have TikTok (and hence “BookTok”) for cover reveals and unboxing videos. Meanwhile, Twitter became X, and some — though by no means all — academics and university presses have since left X for Bluesky. In January 2025, Meta got rid of fact-checkers and relaxed its “hateful conduct” policies, causing concerns about the platform paving the way for more such conduct.\nThose issues are on my mind a lot, not least because I acquire books in fields that are quite openly under attack. On the one hand, expert voices and perspectives have never been more desperately needed in public conversations. On the other, as a writer, you need to decide for yourself what level of public interaction you’re comfortable with in the current climate, whether online or in person. I always say I work with people more than I work with texts, and people come first.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNo. 5: Talk with your editor. That’s the golden rule for most everything in publishing, and publicity is no exception. Promotion takes planning.\nThe wheels of bigger endeavors will likely need to be set in motion long before you’ve been connected to the marketing department. For example, whether or not your book is on an obviously “timely” topic, it’s absolutely worth pitching an op-ed or short essay that “applies” or riffs on your research. Your editor may have thoughts about timing and an appropriate venue, or even helpful connections. Or maybe your scholarly association holds author-meets-critic sessions, the deadline for proposals is fast approaching, and you want to know if the press will be there and hold a signing.\nWhen in doubt, reach out to your editor. Depending on where you are in the writing process, the editor may gently encourage you not to put the cart before the horse. After all, we can’t always promise that “Yes, your book will absolutely be published by such-and-such date.” But that’s also why it’s important for editor and author to communicate early on about promotion ideas.\nNo. 6: Be meticulous in completing your marketing questionnaire. Either before your book goes into production, or shortly thereafter, you will be asked to complete a marketing questionnaire, also known as an author questionnaire. This document is where your publisher collects information about you, your project, your potential audience, and your ideas for reaching them. You may be asked to provide a draft description for the back cover and catalog along with lists of keywords, subject areas, “selling points” (i.e., important features of the project), associations you belong to, conferences you attend, courses it might be used in, and more. Be thoughtful and thorough. This document is your publisher’s primary resource in creating not only a marketing plan but also your book’s metadata — all the coding and details that make it discoverable to libraries, bookstores, individuals, and more.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThis is also where your publisher will ask for a list of journals that should receive an announcement of your book’s publication and prizes for which it could be submitted. Be realistic, but also ambitious. Look back to those concentric circles I mentioned: What are the primary journals in your field? Are there other, more public-facing outlets where you’ve seen books like yours (aka competing or comparable titles) reviewed? Take advantage of whatever connection you or your press have to those outlets.\nOnce you’ve submitted your author questionnaire, keep the channels of communication open. If you learn of a new prize for which your book is eligible or have been invited to give a talk, let your press know. It may be able to provide a discount code or signal boost on social media. Be sure to share any reviews of your book so they can be quoted on your book’s webpage.\nNo. 7: Think locally and mobilize your networks. As the publication date nears, and in the months thereafter, there are lots of little things you can do close to home — and every bit helps:\nAdd your book to your e-signature with a link to its webpage.\nUpdate your website.\nLet your university know so it can share the good news. Derek Krissoff, a longtime publisher, has argued that universities should celebrate the success of their faculty’s books as much as any big research award or sports championship, and I tend to agree.\nAsk your institutional library to purchase a copy — and ask your friends to ask their libraries to do so, too.\nOffer to visit your colleagues’ classrooms and give a talk, virtually or in person.\nLook into whether your local bookstore hosts readings.\nAnd, above all, don’t hesitate to ask both your publisher and your peers for guidance and help. No journal editor will be eager to publish a glowing review of your book if it’s written by someone you’ve praised prominently in your acknowledgments. But friends and colleagues may know others who would be appropriate and willing to pitch a piece about your book to a relevant journal. Or maybe you know someone who successfully pitched an op-ed based on their book to The Conversation,The New York Times, or The Chronicle. Ask about their experience and their contact at the publication.\nNo. 8: Promote other people’s books. I don’t mean in a tit-for-tat way, with the expectation that they’ll promote your book in turn. Build genuine goodwill. If you’re reading something you like, let its author know. Post about it on social media. Pitch a review of it. Ask your library to buy your friends’ and peers’ books. Buy a copy yourself if you can afford it.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThese are challenging times. For some scholars, self-promotion may feel uncomfortable, if not outright cringe. For others, it may entail real professional and personal risks. I don’t take any of that lightly. But it is possible to craft a marketing plan for your book that feels genuine and appropriate.\nWe publish to be read. Self-promotion helps make that happen, but it’s also not the best term to capture what’s really at stake — the dissemination of ideas and expertise, the spurring of spirited debate, the amplification of stories and voices that have been silenced.\nI’ll end on a practical note: Throughout this column, I have cited and linked to various Q&As for authors posted on Ask UP, a site sponsored by the Association of University Presses and a treasure trove of tips and information about publishing. Bookmark Ask Up. Read it. Share it. Full disclosure: I’m a member of the association committee that manages the site. But, hey, what would a piece on self-promotion be without a little self-promotion?\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

Read the previous essays here.\nIt’s easier than ever to find doom-and-gloom rhetoric in higher education. In April I wrote about what it’s like to work in a labor sector targeted by its own government: We often feel angry, abandoned, adrift. Many of us have days when we want to do something about it, yet quickly become overwhelmed by the obstacles or stalled by self-doubt.\nBut that’s only part of the story. It’s also true that, in the face of ceaseless attacks from the White House and governors’ offices, some faculty and staff members are standing up for academe.\nTo hear their voices, I started interviewing people I call the doers. Talking with them challenged my assumptions about what taking action — individually and collectively — looks like in this moment and helped me see a path through panic and pessimism. What surprised me most is that the doers weren’t a bunch of unrealistic idealists. Instead they offered a pragmatic playbook for change. My aim here is to distill and pass along what I learned from them.\nIt turns out, we’re bad at this activism stuff. If it makes you feel better, many faculty and staff members in higher ed have a hard time figuring out how and where to begin the fight.\nFirst, you are trained — through disciplinary specialization and organizational silos — to stay in your lane. It’s often been hammered into your head that you’re a mathematician or instructional designer, and you’ve been conditioned to believe that someone else with more expertise is better suited to champion a cause or engage in grass-roots organizing. You reason: There must be a social-movement scholar or someone else whose job description better lines up with this problem.\nSecond, graduate training can sometimes prevent you from trying things outside your comfort zone. Jessica Riddell, a professor of English and a Shakespearean scholar at Bishop’s University, in Canada, and author of Hope Circuits: Rewiring Universities and Other Systems for Human Flourishing, explained to me in an interview: “As we progress through the academic hierarchies, we are increasingly named as authorities. But if we’re expected to be perfect, impervious experts on a particular subject, then there is little room for the vulnerability or emergence to challenge the actual in the name of the possible.”\nThird, a specialist’s fervor for nuance and carefully weighing the evidence on a particular issue can become an impediment to action. It’s easy to fall victim to the “just one more book fallacy” — that’s when you struggle to take meaningful first steps because you believe you need to study more. Or you get caught up in debates about the most effective course of action and convince yourself that strategies won’t work. After years of turmoil in higher ed, you could be forgiven for thinking nothing will get better. However, as Jamil Zaki, a professor of psychology at Stanford University, argues, it is precisely that type of cynicism that maintains the status quo.\nBut, argues Riddell, you do have a choice here: You can give in to despair, or you can practice hope. “Hope is not a stance,” she said. “It’s not optimism. It’s not Pollyanna. It’s a verb. And while despair gets monolithic and detaches us from each other, hope gets granular, proximate, and in conversation.”\nSo what do the doers teach us about practicing hope?\nADVERTISEMENT\nStep 1: Connect with a community. A petition with more than 4,000 signatures affirming the essential role of higher ed in a democratic and free society originated in a group chat. Daniel Laurison, an associate professor of sociology at Swarthmore College, drafted the petition with the help of a group of scholars who had been talking regularly to create a support network for people doing work on issues pertaining to queer, trans, and other marginalized communities.\nThat group was organized by Alison L. Gash, a professor and department chair of political science at the University of Oregon. “At first, we were just talking about mutual aid, or stepping up to fill in gaps left by institutions, or creating support that was never there,” Gash explained. When Laurison reached out with the idea for a petition, there was already a group ready to help make it happen.\nThe lesson here is that you don’t need to join a big or formal organization. Sometimes the first step toward defending your profession is as simple as having regular conversations with a group of trusted colleagues.\nStep 2: Don’t discount small steps. I asked Laurison and Gash if they ever questioned the effectiveness of a petition. “The letter, by itself, doesn’t do very much,” Laurison admitted. “But there is a lot of fear out there right now. For some people, simply adding their name is a brave first step.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nIf you’re anxious about getting involved in politics, seeing all of those names suggests that there are others who share your values. And after taking that first brave step, you might feel emboldened to take another. Petition signers, Gash said, “also realized there are a lot of different ways you can show your support for the values of education, diversity, and human dignity that don’t require you to be marching down the street.”\nThe petition allows people to check if they are interested in being connected with others on their campus who signed it, creating an additional opportunity to be part of a community. For Karen Costa, an adjunct instructor and faculty developer, it’s those small steps in tight communities that truly drive change: “Small things will eventually scale if we keep doing them and start building our communities. So the way I take action is to say to myself, ‘What is the next, best, smallest step that I can take?’”\nStep 3: Leverage your strengths. A theme in my conversations with the doers was that they found ways to use their existing knowledge and talents. A good example is Karim Mattar, an associate professor of English at the University of Colorado at Boulder who studies Palestinian literature and was involved in organizing the April 17 National Day of Action for Higher Ed. Mattar reminded me that there is a continuity between what many people already know how to do in higher ed as educators and the work of organizing others for action. “This work is about engaging with people and meeting them where they are,” he said. “It is about having difficult dialogues and constructive conversations.”\nAbby André, a doctoral fellow at Ohio State University, was spurred into action because of her experience as a lawyer with the U.S. Department of Justice. “I’m a former fed,” she said. “Many of my friends are still there. People who I consider my chosen family are there, and they were on the front lines of these changes. And the more I was talking to people who don’t have that experience, the more I really understood that communities outside D.C. don’t really understand how the federal government touches their lives.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nAndré started The Impact Project to visualize how cuts to the federal work force and grants affect everyone. One of her goals was to provide data so that the public could understand what’s happening across the country and make sound decisions. “This is just an honest and earnest attempt to represent the data,” André said. “And that is very much in alignment with who I am. We all have to find our own paths, our own ways of being in the world that won’t drain us in this very chaotic time.”\nStep 4: Prioritize your mental health and clarify your role. “How do we live and work in this era of permacrisis? It’s a good question, and people really want answers.” That is how Costa, who specializes in climate pedagogy, neurodiversity, and trauma, started our interview. “It’s very difficult to do any of these sort of movement strategies when people are not feeling well.”\nShe sees widespread signs that faculty and staff members are struggling with their brain and nervous-system health right now. “My climate pedagogy work is grounded in my ability to stay healthy,” Costa said. One simple outlet to help with her mental health has been meeting regularly with a pottery class. She also receives professional help: “I’m very happy to be transparent that I take two medications and do other things to give me a baseline of safety and capacity to take action.”\nThe point: Take the time to put yourself in the best position mentally and physically to pursue your activism.\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhich brings me to Costa’s other tip: Figure out your marching orders. If you’re like most of us, you feel so flooded with feelings and inundated with breaking news that you aren’t sure what to do next. “I think people really could benefit from taking an hour to sit down and reflect about what you see as your role,” Costa advised. “Get off the internet. You can’t find your role on social media.”\nThink about what kinds of things you feel comfortable doing to defend higher education and your profession, and which ones are outside your comfort zone. “Even when I have all the emotions,” Costa said, “I can say that I feel like I know what my part is. I have clarity about those priorities. It’s wiggly and it’s messy, but I know what my role is and what my role is not.”\nStep 5: Embrace the possibilities of hope as a verb. Perhaps the most important lesson that I took from these conversations was that practicing hope is itself hope-giving. Doing something good in the world does a world of good for us as humans. Very few of the people I interviewed set out to solve a giant, structural problem in one fell swoop. Rather, they got, as Riddell said, “granular, proximate, and in conversation” with others.\nMattar put it best: “Getting involved in these communities, both locally and with colleagues at other campuses, offered succor and a feeling of solidarity and connection in what otherwise would have been a moment of deep isolation and despair. These communities have been sources of hope for me in such deeply meaningful ways.”\nOn a personal level, I’m starting a leadership role in my department, and I’m already implementing these steps. I’m doing things I know are good for my mental health and writing out my values. I’m replacing scrolling with strolling to coffee with colleagues. And remembering that small acts — even “easy” ones squarely in my wheelhouse — can clear a path for subsequent steps.\nRead other items in Working Better.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

As we strategize to recruit, yield, and retain students, we must ask ourselves: What if one of our most powerful tools is not new technology or a slick marketing campaign, but the human-centered practice of hospitality?\nWhen I served as a dean of admission, I used to tell my team: We may not be able to outspend or out-prestige other institutions, but we can beat them on how we make people feel. That mind-set helped us build a culture of care and belonging — one that students and families remembered long after their visit ended. And in a world where students crave belonging and families want to be acknowledged and valued, that emotional connection matters more than ever.\nMaya Angelou captured this truth perfectly: “People will forget what you said, they will forget what you did, but they will always remember how you made them feel.” That quote has guided my leadership throughout my career, and it’s never been more relevant than it is today. In fact, when I was an admission dean, I had it laminated and gave it to every member of my team as a daily reminder of our charge. In a competitive, uncertain environment, students aren’t just looking for academic fit or financial-aid packages — they’re looking for human connection. They’re looking for home.\nCreating a culture of hospitality isn’t about being nice or offering perks. It’s about intentionality. It’s about recognizing — as restaurateur Danny Meyer writes in Setting the Table: The Transforming Power of Hospitality in Business — that “everyone is walking around with an invisible sign that reads: Make me feel special.”\nIn the enrollment game, that sign is hanging around the necks of prospective students, their parents, current students, and even our faculty and staff members. Hospitality isn’t a department — it’s a mind-set. Hospitality in college admissions means moving from a one-size-fits-all mentality to ultra-personalization. Every student should feel like the institution is creating experiences specifically for them.\nHow? These four steps are a good place to start:\nFirst, we must train for it. Just as we prepare teams to handle applications or conduct interviews with prospective students, we must build training programs that equip all of our people — admissions officers, faculty members, financial-aid counselors, and even student workers — with the tools to practice empathy and read emotional cues. Are we training staff members to anticipate needs rather than simply respond to them? Are we creating a sense of welcome that transcends departments and internal silos? Everyone should understand their role in this culture change.\nConduct a hospitality audit. Walk through your student experience from inquiry to enrollment to orientation. Where are the friction points? Where might a student feel invisible or overwhelmed? Small details — unclear signage, rushed interactions, or inaccessible information — can erode belonging. But with intention, those same moments can become opportunities for connection.\nInvest in formal hospitality training. We can train our admissions staff internally on how to make families feel special, design a wonderful tour, or create an effective admitted-student day. But if you really want to differentiate how you make students and families feel, and have the resources to do so, investing in professional hospitality training can be a game changer. Form partnerships with experts in the restaurant, hotel, and service industries — those who have long mastered the art of making people feel valued. I once attended a training called Creating Raves that fundamentally shifted how I lead organizations. It reminded me that we all work in the service industry — and like any service sector, higher education’s success depends on the emotional resonance of the experiences we deliver.\nReward it. Celebrate the people who go above and beyond to make others feel at home on the campus. Make hospitality a value that shows up in performance reviews, recognition programs, and leadership messaging. When you reward what you value, you build a culture that sustains it.\nHospitality has the power to surprise and delight. It isn’t just about comfort — it’s about creating moments that elicit emotion, spark joy, and foster deep belonging. I’ll never forget an admitted-student day when, without warning, a big group of us (including the president) launched into a flash mob on the quad. The prospective students were in awe. There was laughter, cheering, and a contagious energy that filled the air. That moment may not have been the only reason my enrollment numbers went up that year — but I have no doubt it helped. Those prospects felt something. They felt joy. That’s the kind of emotional memory that stays with someone long after they leave the campus. Bring the joy.\nWill Guidara, in his transformative 2022 book Unreasonable Hospitality, describes hospitality not as a service transaction, but as an act of emotional generosity. “Service is black and white,” he wrote. “Hospitality is color.”\nIn higher education, we’ve mastered the service checklist — information sessions, campus tours, academic-advising appointments — but, too often, we miss the opportunity to infuse those moments with the color of hospitality. Hospitality, when done right, becomes a differentiator. It’s what turns a campus visit for an admitted student into a moment of belonging. It’s what makes a first-generation student feel like college is for them. It’s what keeps a struggling sophomore from transferring. In short, it’s what keeps the heart of our institutions beating.\nResearch supports what many of us have long observed anecdotally: We can train our staffs internally on how to make families feel special, how to create a wonderful tour or admitted-student day, but if you really want to differentiate how you make students and families feel, and have the resources to do so, investing in formal training can be a game changer. Admitted students who feel a strong sense of belonging are more likely to commit to the college, persist and graduate. As The Chronicle reported in 2023: “Research shows that college students who feel that they belong at their institutions get better grades and fare better on persistence, engagement, and mental health.” Similarly, the Institute for Higher Education Policy highlights belonging as a key contributor to academic success, particularly for students of color and first-generation college-goers. Hospitality isn’t just nice — it’s strategic.\nYet too often, hospitality is misunderstood as the responsibility of the admissions office or student affairs. That’s a mistake. A culture of hospitality must permeate every corner of the campus. It must show up in how financial-aid offices explain award letters, how professors interact with students during office hours, how facilities staff members greet passersby on the quad. Everyone is part of the welcome committee, whether they know it or not.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnd just like in the restaurant industry, hospitality in higher education requires training, intention, and practice. In Setting the Table, Meyer talks about “enlightened hospitality,” where putting your team first allows them to better serve others. The same principle applies on our campuses. If we want our staff and faculty members to exude warmth and care, we must first extend that same hospitality to them. Leadership must model it — and reward it.\nOne of the most compelling moments I ever witnessed as a campus leader came from a custodian. A family had arrived early for a tour and wandered into a quiet building. The custodian, seeing them looking a bit lost, stopped, smiled, and offered to walk them to the admissions office personally. That family later wrote to me, saying the moment sealed their decision: “We knew this was a place that would take care of our child.” That is the power of hospitality.\nImagine what might change if we all saw ourselves as hosts — if everyone who worked at your college understood that part of their role was to make other people feel welcomed, valued, and special. It requires us to slow down, to be present, to center human experience in environments often driven by metrics and efficiency.\nSome might argue that hospitality is a luxury we can’t afford in the face of public skepticism, federal budget cuts, and enrollment challenges. I believe the opposite: It is a necessity we cannot ignore. Because at its core, hospitality is about human connection. And that — more than prestige or rankings — is what drives student success. What I learned in my years as an admissions dean is that it wasn’t the most selective or prestigious institutions that won over students. It was the ones that made them feel seen.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSome colleges and universities have already begun to go “all in” on hospitality. For example, Quinnipiac University, Robert Morris University, Southern New Hampshire University, and the University of Utah have hired a “chief experience officer.” They know what businesses have known all along: that we live in an experience economy, and those who focus on how their customers feel will outpace everyone else. This is why the first position I hired when I became head of the National Association for College Admission Counseling was a chief experience officer.\nIf we are to thrive in the years ahead, we must not only welcome students, but also build a campus culture in which hospitality is the default, not something reserved for special occasions. We must remember that education, at its best, is not just about knowledge — it’s about belonging.\nAnd belonging begins with how we make people feel.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

How can academe respond to such intense criticism of its very purpose? How do we prove our worth — particularly at a time when public funding of university research is being loudly and vigorously debated in the political arena?\nThose aren’t new questions. Three years ago, responding to just such public pressures in Arizona, we came up with a solution. Our Board of Regents — overseeing Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University, and the University of Arizona — pioneered a novel approach to research funding: What if we created a new grant program that put the public interest first and applied practical research to the most pressing problems facing our state?\nThe result — known as the Regents Research Grants program — has been a big success here and is a model that other states could replicate. As a member of the Arizona governing board and founder of the program, I am sharing here how it works in the hope that it will spark similar innovation across the country and help other universities to make the case for the value of publicly funded research.\nHow we got started. Given our intention to spotlight how the public might directly benefit from academic research, our first step was a listening tour. We asked a broad array of public partners: “If you had a think tank at your disposal, what problem would you ask it to solve?” We heard from city, county, law-enforcement, and other community leaders. Most important, we put the question to then-Gov. Doug Ducey, who assembled a task force to solicit ideas from agencies across state government.\nResearch proposals poured in, identifying problems for our “think tank.” The Board of Regents culled through the projects using criteria that gave extra weight to those with the greatest public benefit, as well as those that could be tackled by multi-university teams.\nWhat we funded. We pulled aside $10 million a year for the program. And because of the unique public interest being served, these grants have received as much mainstream media attention — more than 100 stories in the past three years — as the full $2.2-billion worth of research done by our three universities in the same time span.\nThe program’s funding comes from a very small allocation of state sales tax, paid directly by every Arizona consumer at the cash register. So we had one requirement: Every recipient of a Regents Research Grant had to pass what we called the “Starbucks Test” — the project had to be simple and cogent enough that it could be explained to someone in the time it takes for them to wait in line for coffee.\nAmong the recipients that pair university researchers with state needs:\nArizona’s Department of Forestry and Fire Management has used the Regents program for multiple projects focused on controlling wildfire. For example, university researchers are tackling the impact of bark beetles, which have been ravaging state forests and rendering them more vulnerable to wildfire. Scientists have been using acoustic and sonar technology to track and predict the beetle’s migration patterns, enabling its targeted eradication.\nThe state’s Department of Water Resources recognized that a massive amount of precious desert rainwater might be captured if our geologists could map aquifers, and the state could create runoff corridors to collect it. With the help of our universities, we did.\nState health officials have identified Valley fever as one of the most dangerous and avoidable health risks facing Arizonans. It is caused by coccidioidomycosis, a fungus that lives in desert soil and is spread by the wind. Atmospheric scientists at our state universities are identifying predictive tools to anticipate when and where the risk of Valley fever is highest, and to alert the public. Meanwhile our chemistry professors are pioneering a spray that may be used at scale to harden the soil and prevent the fungus from going airborne.\nA brief summary of other projects: Professors at our public universities are examining how state policy and resources can be used to mitigate accidents among new drivers (for the transportation department); seeking an engineering solution to the removal of fluorinated organic species from water (environmental quality); and developing a highly customizable computer program that could inventory dangerous abandoned mines (for a collection of state agencies).\nAll of that work continues under Gov. Katie Hobbs. While the state’s been our primary customer, it’s not the only one. Regents grants are digging into local and regional problems, too:\nArea fire chiefs asked for help dealing with the effects of PFAS chemicals on firefighters, whose cancer rates are significantly higher than the average. Campus researchers are helping to identify causes and mitigation options.\nThe League of Arizona Cities & Towns brought to our attention the reality that recycling only works on a scale that is unattainable by most rural cities and towns. In response, university social scientists diagnosed the recycling portfolio of dozens of small towns and created a hub-and-spoke model that enables them to reach commercial scale as a consortium.\nAn association of county supervisors has sought help from faculty experts on purchasing practices and on hiring detention officers, law-enforcement personnel, and firefighters.\nThere are more. The volume of grant proposals has increased each year. In the next iteration of the program, we have created Regents Community Grants that will be focused on communities and economic sectors. Later this year, we will convene problem-solving sessions with representatives from key Arizona industries — such as agriculture, forestry, and bioscience — to identify areas where our universities can be of service. We’ve set aside about $1 million as a trial run, and there is strong interest.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAll of these projects have had to pass that Starbucks Test. And they do. They’ve earned public support and media coverage because the grants are relatable.\nMedia exposure isn’t the primary objective, of course. But it is a valuable indicator of public interest — no small factor when public dollars are involved. Additionally, the Regents grants have helped foster a whole new collection of university advocates. At the State Capitol this session, firefighters, police chiefs, and local mayors were among those advocating on behalf of the Board of Regents and its budget request for universities. That’s a new look, to be sure.\nSolving societal problems. Building community advocates. Turning intellectual capacity into political capital. Who knew that a simple refocus of a portion of university research funding could accomplish so much?\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

The list of attendees is in front of you and now comes the part that matters most: making sure they show up on your campus in the fall. But with so many students to reach, and limited time, it’s easy to feel stuck and overwhelmed. That’s where generative AI can help: Not by replacing your expertise, but by acting as a time-saving collaborator on routine enrollment tasks so you can focus on making personal and authentic connections with students and parents.\nIn my work as a higher-ed-enrollment marketer, I’ve spent years studying yield — the share of accepted applicants who commit to a college. In a recent series of my podcast, The Application, I explored how AI can enhance “yield season,” that anxious period between when admissions decisions go out and when students commit to a campus. I’ve thought a lot about what drives student decision-making and even wrote my dissertation on audience-centered marketing in higher education. So when I say AI can help with yield, I mean I’ve tried it myself.\nWhat I’ve learned is that AI doesn’t have to make our work feel less personal. Used thoughtfully, it can actually do the opposite.\nWe’re in a moment when every new tool claims to be “powered by AI.” I get at least one email from a vendor every day with that pitch. At the same time, many enrollment professionals are skeptical about using generative AI in their work. They’re worried about ethics, privacy, even the environmental impact. Others simply haven’t had the time to explore AI and don’t know where to start.\nThose reservations are valid and worthy of real conversation. We should be asking hard questions and making deliberate choices. My aim here is to make a different case: That AI can actually support the human side of our work. That these tools, used with intention, can free up our time to do the parts of our work that matter most — like connecting with students, providing them with clear and relevant information, and showing we understand them.\nThink of AI as a tech-driven intern, not a substitute for your knowledge.\nSkepticism about AI’s ability to do any of that is healthy and forces us to ask: What does this tech actually solve in the admissions context? And what should it never touch?\nIn yield season, one of our biggest challenges is scale. Students and parents expect customized and personalized information to guide them in making this choice. That is simply how we all experience life as consumers now. AI can help us meet these expectations more efficiently and effectively.\nThink of AI as a tech-driven intern, not a substitute for your knowledge. It can help you move faster, but you still need to steer. For example:\nA student submits an inquiry form on your campus website asking about their intended field of study. Halda, an AI-driven tool, instantly serves up content tailored to their interests without endless clicking or digging through your site. The student gets what they’re looking for immediately, and you get an insight into that student. You now know not just their prospective major but what they most want to know about it. When you reach out to the student, you’re not starting from zero, and you can provide a relevant, truly personal outreach.\nOr take personalized videos. Allied Pixel creates dynamic, data-driven videos that adapt to each student’s name, academic interests, location, and even financial-aid status, tailoring the narrative to what matters most to each viewer. For a prospective nursing major from out of state, the video might showcase the university’s lab facilities and dormitories. A local business major could see highlights of commuter support and nearby internship opportunities.\nElement451 offers AI-powered agents that help students navigate financial aid, stay on top of deadlines, and connect with campus resources, supporting both yield and retention. These AI agents can also help students stay engaged after committing to college and making their deposit, which is an increasingly critical step for reducing melt.\nOn my podcast, Kelsey Smith and James Cox, both of Purdue University’s business school, explained how they use progressive profiling to collect information from prospective students gradually, and from multiple sources, instead of overwhelming them with long forms to fill out up front. As students interact with the admissions office, their profiles grow richer. The role of AI here is to help the admissions team tailor its responses: Someone focused on affordability might see messaging about the value and return on investment of a bachelor’s degree, while a student asking about campus life might receive content highlighting student experiences. As Kelsey put it, “They’re getting similar information — it’s just presented in different ways to get them to take the action that’s best for them.”\nAnother compelling example comes from the University of California at Davis. On the AI for U podcast, Lisa Nguyen, a digital marketer supporting the university’s part-time M.B.A. program, shared how her team uses ChatGPT to analyze their own application data. With enrollments declining, they needed to pinpoint the most effective windows for marketing their programs. Historically, they relied on anecdotal input from program directors to determine timing. Now, using AI, they’ve been able to identify trends — such as when applications are most likely to be submitted — and adjust their marketing accordingly. For prospective students that means they’re more likely to hear about the program at just the right time — when they’re thinking about applying but haven’t yet made a decision. That kind of well-timed, relevant communication can improve engagement and, ultimately, increase yield.\nThose are creative, ambitious ideas for how AI tools can help us bring more of the students we admit to the campus, come fall. But what would everyday use of AI look like in our roles? Below are a few ways that enrollment and marketing teams can put generative AI to work — starting with simple, low-risk tasks that support personalization without sacrificing authenticity.\nADVERTISEMENT\nUse it to prepare for one-on-one conversations with prospects. Imagine using ChatGPT, Bard, or another generative-AI platform to summarize what you know about a student before a call: the major they plan to pursue, the prospective-student events they’ve attended, the questions they’ve asked. The AI gives you talking points. You spend less time digging through notes and more time building personal connections with the student.\nAsk AI to help you tailor a message to different groups of recipients. Take a routine task like sending out deposit reminders to admitted students. AI can help you write multiple versions of the reminder email — one for STEM students, one for first-generation college students, and one for students who live in counties near the campus. Small shifts in tone and relevance can mean big changes in response rates. When students receive content that reflects their interests and background, they “feel seen” by the college.\nCheck out The Chronicle’s latest advice stories\nStill skeptical? Start small. Use an AI tool to help brainstorm the subject line of a marketing email. Ask it to help you update an old blog post. Or, if your college is already using a chatbot to capture the concerns of prospective students, ask AI to analyze the transcripts for trends. You might discover housing is the top concern this month, or that admitted students are asking more questions about career outcomes than in previous years. With those insights, you can update your messaging, adjust your outreach strategy, or create content that directly responds to those concerns.\nAI can also help your marketing staff with A/B testing (comparing two variations of content to see which is more effective). Create two versions of an email: one written entirely by you and one written with the help of AI. Compare click-through rates, or see which version earns more clicks or replies.\nADVERTISEMENT\nHere’s the line I wouldn’t cross. I would never use AI to generate entirely original content meant to sound like a human wrote it, especially if you’re not reviewing or editing it carefully. Generic messages can’t replace genuine voice or real insight, and they do not help us to differentiate our institutions. A post written entirely by ChatGPT for a new-students blog might look clean, but students are smart. They can tell when something doesn’t sound like it came from a real person or reflect the actual tone of your institution.\nAgain, the goal is to use AI to assist your work, not to replace your work.\nThis very essay is an illustration of what I mean: I wrote it, but I also used generative AI in the outlining and editing stages of the process. An AI tool helped me structure an outline for my ideas, and once I’d written a draft, it pointed to unclear sentences and made proofreading suggestions. Every idea, decision, and example I’ve shared here came from real conversations, real experiences, and a human who still believes that authentically connecting with students and families is at the heart of admissions work.\nWe shouldn’t use AI to replace creative thinking or strategic storytelling. AI doesn’t know your campus culture. It can’t feel what a student is feeling the week before their deposit is due. But it can make the work behind personalization — like segmenting, repurposing, and analyzing — much faster and more manageable. In fact, the more time AI saves you, the more time you can spend on what matters most: building relationships with students and families.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.
