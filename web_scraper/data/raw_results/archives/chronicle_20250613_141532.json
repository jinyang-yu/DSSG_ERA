Ono, a respected immunologist and the former president of the University of Michigan, appeared for a public job interview and seemed to feign ignorance on the efficacy of vaccine mandates?

Ono, a respected immunologist and the former president of the University of Michigan, appeared for a public job interview and seemed to feign ignorance on the efficacy of vaccine mandates? Or when he struggled to answer whether any doctors at Michigan had ever surgically removed the genitals or breasts of minors in gender-affirming procedures? Or was it weeks before that, when he decided he wanted to become president of the University of Florida, and instead dove headlong into a political buzzsaw?\nWhatever the moment was, it became abundantly clear sometime on June 3 that Ono wasn’t going to be the 14th president of Florida’s flagship university. The State University System’s Board of Governors spent that afternoon pummeling him with questions during a three-hour meeting that more closely resembled a partisan Senate confirmation hearing than the fawning ratification ceremonies that are customary for soon-to-be anointed presidents.\nBy the time the board held a roll call vote, rejecting Ono 10-6, the majority seemed to have had it, not just with Ono, but with everything he represented. They were not going to be fooled, the board said with their votes and their incessant questioning, by what they’d concluded was just another liberal academic in disguise. It didn’t matter that Ono, sporting a solid red tie, had promised he was now essentially one of them — a repentant past supporter of diversity, equity and inclusion, who’d come to see DEI as a stifling orthodoxy that had spread like kudzu in academe’s garden of liberal groupthink.\nIn another era, Ono’s ordeal might have been seen as little more than an embarrassing miscalculation by a campus-level board that backed the wrong horse. But across higher education, what happened in Florida this month now stands as a signal event that speaks directly to its times. Colleges are facing enormous pressure to do away with anything that might be seen as “woke” — from gender studies to diversity programs — and many institutions are falling in line, either by choice or by law. But there is reason to question whether any rollback of progressivism on a college campus will ever be seen by the sector’s critics as sufficient. After acceding to many of the Trump administration’s recent demands to change its policies and practices, Columbia University hasn’t seen its federal funding restored or its political fortunes meaningfully changed.\nAt a moment like this, the story of Ono, an aspiring college leader who foreswore DEI and walked away with nothing, has taken on an allegorical quality. His experience strikes at the heart of the most pressing moral and practical questions confronting higher education today: What do we stand for? What are we willing to abandon? And how much will ever be enough?\nIn the days since Ono’s resignation, academics across the country have been wrestling with what this episode says about higher education’s precarious trajectory in the current political environment. They’ve also, either soberly or gleefully, whispered about the damage all this has done to the reputations of Ono, the University of Florida, and a conservative-controlled state that many academics say they’ve written off entirely.\nThis article is based on interviews with more than 15 people tied to higher education and state-level politics, including current and former search consultants, former college leaders, faculty members, and others. Some spoke to The Chronicle on condition of anonymity, either to protect professional relationships or future career prospects. (Ono did not respond to a message over LinkedIn seeking comment, but shortly thereafter he viewed a Chronicle reporter’s profile page on the networking site.)\nIt started with Christopher F. Rufo. Soon after Ono was named the sole finalist for the UF presidency, the conservative activist concluded that Ono was hopelessly woke — the very sort of left-wing intellectual that Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has lambasted for years. Rufo, whose past social-media campaigns helped unseat Harvard University’s president for plagiarism, saw another opportunity to take down a liberal academic.\n“After consultation with power brokers around the state of Florida, I felt that it was possible to win this persuasion fight at the Board of Governors,” Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, told The Chronicle in an interview before the system board vote.\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnd win he would. In the ensuing days, Rufo waged an all-out campaign on X to sink Ono’s candidacy. A deluge of digital evidence, from documents to videos, captured Ono’s enthusiastic past support of DEI, preaching the virtues of gender pronouns and Indigenous land acknowledgments. In short order, UF’s preferred narrative about Ono — that of a rising star who was leaving Michigan, ranked as a top-3 public university, for Florida’s emerging higher-ed utopia — was all but erased. The university, by any objective measure, was completely outmatched by laptop warriors like Rufo, who have utterly changed the game when it comes to shaping public opinion about higher education.\nThat’s not a surprise, a former university president told The Chronicle. Outside activists are using increasingly sophisticated and effective tactics, the source said, while “universities and boards have the equivalent of a quill pen.”\nOno launched his own countercampaign, publicly announcing his evolution on DEI in an op-ed published by Inside Higher Ed. He quietly asked that his name be removed from a public letter, signed by more than 600 college presidents, decrying the Trump administration’s interference into higher education.\nBut Rufo’s message resonated with the right people, who saw Ono’s clean-up effort in a harsh light. Paul Renner, a former Republican speaker of the Florida House of Representatives who joined the system board this year, said Ono’s PR campaign showed a lack of conviction. Given all of his past statements, including a very recent decision to sign the anti-Trump letter, it didn’t track that Ono’s political conversion predated his interest in the UF position, Renner said. In Renner’s thinking, he was an employer, and this was a job candidate who simply wasn’t on the level.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“It’s not a political thing,” he said. “It’s a candor thing.”\nAppearing in person before the board, Ono found he couldn’t possibly salvage his candidacy. It didn’t matter that he had, as Michigan’s president, abolished what was widely considered to be among the most expansive and well-funded DEI operations in all of higher education. Nor did it matter that one of Ono’s biggest supporters, seated alongside him like a guardian angel, was none other than Morteza (Mori) Hosseini, the chair of UF’s Board of Trustees and a major Republican donor with strong ties to DeSantis.\n“There wasn’t really anything he could say to move my opinion,” Renner said of Ono.\n(The governor did not pressure the board to vote one way or the other, Renner said, but advised members to “vote your conscience.”)\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe board’s interview took on such a prosecutorial tenor that, at one point, the chairman declared: “We are not at the Supreme Court.” Ono was confronted with documents and evidence he hadn’t seen in advance. Some of the intel used to prosecute him came from Ono’s own former board back in Michigan. At least one Michigan regent shared internal emails with a member of Florida’s system board, two sources told The Chronicle.\nIn hindsight, Ono’s supporters looked naïve. They headed into the meeting thinking he would emerge from it bruised but ratified, three sources told The Chronicle. What followed, though, looked to many like a premeditated takedown that went beyond just blocking Ono. A signal was being sent, several observers concluded: This is what we do to woke academics down in Florida; and much of the country is with us now.\n“They had it soup to nuts who was going to ask what question,” a former longtime UF administrator said. “They did a remarkable job, if you like executions.”\nBoard votes of this kind usually feel more like coronations than deliberations, which made the spectacle all the more jarring. “I viewed it as appalling,” said Gene D. Block, chancellor emeritus of the University of California at Los Angeles. “It put him in such an awkward position. You’ve given up one position, you’re kind of assured that you’re going to get an appointment at a new institution.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nTechnically speaking, of course, that isn’t so. Alan Levine, vice chair of the Board of Governors, who voted against Ono, said in a recent column that the board had a “constitutional responsibility” to do its job in public. “Governance works,” Levine wrote, “even when it feels uncomfortable.”\nBut Florida may find that good governance comes at the expense of qualified candidates. The state’s process of selecting college leaders is more confidential than it once was, but the law still requires a 21-day period in which the finalists — or, in UF’s case, a sole finalist — are publicly known. That left Ono twisting in the wind, as the Rufos of the world piled on. Before the vote, even Donald Trump Jr. had weighed in, blasting Ono on X as a “woke psycho.”\nThe saga has left a bad taste in the mouths of some practitioners who work behind the scenes to fill top-level jobs. Two search firms told The Chronicle they will no longer participate in higher-education searches in Florida. “We aren’t going to even bid on jobs in Florida,” one top search firm leader said. “Too much outside interference. We do a lot of work in these searches and don’t want it just thrown away.”\nAnother search consultant, in a separate conversation, said the board vote sent an unambiguous message to all of higher education: Only candidates aligned with the board’s uber-conservative members need apply.\nADVERTISEMENT\n“Top people looking for presidencies have avoided Florida for years now — at least a decade,” another former university president said. Sitting presidents and other marquee applicants won’t participate in a process so lacking in confidentiality, the person said, and “their current political divides will just make the searches even less attractive than they have been. But the truth is that most strong candidates have avoided the state already.”\nAfter Ono’s public flogging, would-be college leaders nationally are likely to be more circumspect about being public finalists for very long, a search consultant said. “I think more applicants will want to keep their names private for longer so they don’t have to go through weeks of attacks online and in social media,” the person said.\nWhat happened here shows complete and utter hypocrisy.\nFewer qualified candidates may further clear the way for politicians to seize jobs like these, building on a trend in Florida. But lawmakers often “aren’t prepared for the complicated nature of these public flagships,” said Michael S. Harris, interim dean of the Simmons School of Education and Human Development and a professor of higher education at Southern Methodist University. “What are they going to do when asked to negotiate the F&A rate for the medical school?” he said, referencing facilities and administrative costs. “You need experienced presidents.”\nThat’s probably not what UF will get, though, many observers said. “What qualified academic in their right mind would choose to subject themselves to such a process?” said Amanda J. Phalin, a former chair of UF’s Faculty Senate, who recently completed a term on the Board of Governors.\nADVERTISEMENT\nPhalin, an instructional associate professor in UF’s business school, isn’t universally opposed to politicians leading universities. As an ex officio trustee, she voted for Ben Sasse — the former Republican U.S. senator who lasted less than two years in the job — and took considerable heat for it from her colleagues. But the cat is out of the bag now, Phalin said. The majority of the state governing board has shown itself to be an undisputably politicized body, she said, with little interest in what’s best for the university. For all of the talk about the need for “viewpoint diversity” in higher education — a common refrain among conservatives — “they clearly only care about it when it impacts their side,” she said.\n“What happened here shows complete and utter hypocrisy,” Phalin said. “And you know what? I think they know it, too. I think they know it, and I think they don’t care.”\nIn his quest to become president in Florida, Ono, a scientist at heart, allowed the country and his higher-education peers to observe a real-time experiment in which he was the test subject. He started with a powerful and pertinent question: Could a longtime DEI proponent believably “evolve,” convincing even hard-line conservatives he had come to see its folly? And what would be required to succeed?\nFlorida is a sui generis state with a particular aversion to academe’s leftward tendencies, so the replicability of Ono’s experiment in other parts of the country isn’t clear. But many observers say they were stunned by the lengths to which Ono seemed willing to go to prove his dubious hypothesis that Florida might accept him as a credible convert.\nADVERTISEMENT\nTime after time during his public interviews, both before the state board and UF’s trustees, Ono showed a willingness to embrace positions popular among conservatives or to renounce his past liberal stances. Questioned about mandating Covid vaccines, for example, Ono played down the real-world applicability of his hard-earned academic credentials, pronouncing himself a mere “mouse doctor,” and “a test-tube guy.” It was, for some who watched, a cringy and telling moment in which a well-educated person seemed willingly to shun the one thing academics value most: expertise.\n“It is like a historian saying, ‘Well, we don’t know what caused the Civil War,’” a former university president said. “I think that’s why it wounded or shocked people so much.”\nOno is not without supporters. But his compromises, which he seemed to stack up by the hour, made him a bit of a heel among some of his higher-ed peers. Erin Hennessy, executive vice president of TVP Communications, was at a gathering of American Council on Education fellows when news broke of Ono’s rejected bid. “There was a lot of schadenfreude in that room — a lot of people thinking pride goeth before the fall,” she said.\nAt a moment when higher education is in the political crosshairs, Ono appeared to some like he was more interested in joining the snipers than fighting back alongside his academic brethren. “It absolutely felt like a political candidate trying to dance around objective reality,” Hennessy said. “You have to answer something.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nDennis M. Barden, a higher-education consultant who worked for 25 years in executive searches, described the entire episode as “unrelentingly sad.” Ono was, by Barden’s estimation, a “shooting star.” But he has “severely compromised his academic future” by running away from the things people thought he stood for, Barden said.\n“I think very highly of Santa. I always have,” Barden said. “And this is not the person whom I thought I knew.”\nSome who have worked with Ono, though, said they were more validated than surprised by how he acquitted himself.\n“He’s not a strong leader,” a senior administrator who has worked closely with Ono said. “He wanted to do all the fun stuff, but not the hard stuff. He hated conflict because he wanted to be popular and liked. Conflict could result in someone not liking him, and he couldn’t stand that.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nWhat’s surprising, the administrator continued, is not that Ono shifted his positions; it’s that he misread the politics of the moment. “I thought he always was very astute at picking up on the political winds and adjusting to them,” the person said. “He was a windsock that way. I don’t know how that backfired so much at Florida.”\nLike a political candidate, an aspiring college president has to be ambitious without seeming opportunist. A compelling origin story can help, and Ono has that. The child of Japanese immigrants, Ono was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, and holds dual citizenship in the United States and Canada. His father, a mathematician, came to the U.S. in 1959 at the invitation of J. Robert Oppenheimer, who at the time directed the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. Ono’s parents arrived in North America, he said at a Michigan commencement ceremony, “with a single suitcase, limited English and a deep hope for a better future.” They raised a boy, Ono told UF’s trustees, who, even now, marvels at reading “the words of The Star Spangled Banner.”\nEvery decision he makes is viewed in how it affects his career. ... He always leaves before the check comes due.\nBut there is another less flattering story about Ono that some people in higher education say screams from his CV. Tenures for college presidents have gotten shorter, but Ono stands out in this regard: president of the University of Cincinnati, four years; president of the University of British Columbia, six years; president of Michigan, less than three years — the shortest tenure in the university’s history.\n“Candidates with serial short tenures for most search committees would be red flags,” said Shelly Weiss Storbeck, a recently retired search consultant who worked in the industry for three decades.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe former senior administrator who worked with Ono put it more bluntly, characterizing his leadership as a “sugar high,” adding that: “Every decision he makes is viewed in how it affects his career. It’s why he stays so short at places. He always leaves before the check comes due.”\nAt Michigan, Ono was greeted by many with great promise. “I felt a lot of pride, especially as an Asian American, to have an Asian American president,” said Allen Liu, a Michigan professor who served as chair of the Faculty Senate in the early 2020s. Ono was good with students, Liu said, and “he brought energy to campus.”\nAmong some insiders, though, Ono’s style eventually wore thin. He was known to disappear without notice, sometimes for days at a time, leaving staff without direction. And he was reluctant to take stands on important issues that might be divisive, including campus antisemitism, even when Michigan regents urged him to do so, emails obtained by The Chronicle show.\n“You couldn’t pin him down on making a decision until he had figured out the fallout,” a second administrator who worked closely with Ono said. “If he could avoid making the decision, he would — so if it went bad it wouldn’t blow back on him.”\nADVERTISEMENT\nFor much of his career, Ono’s calling card has been his accessibility with students. He was way ahead of other presidents in cultivating a following on what was then Twitter. At Michigan, though, he became known for hunkering down. He had about a dozen people on his security team, and he tried to evade protesters by using decoy cars when leaving events, three sources told The Chronicle.\nAfter losing out on the UF job, Ono — the once-prolific Tweeter-in-chief — has gone silent on social media. That’s probably the right idea, said Hennessy, the communications consultant. “The only smart thing he’s done,” she said, “is to disappear since the vote was taken.”\nIt is now clear that, as much as he was running toward Florida, Ono was in some ways running away from Michigan, too. In a resignation letter, obtained by MLive/The Ann Arbor News, Ono described growing tensions with his bosses. “I’ve come to believe that the current dynamics within the board — and with a subset of the regents and myself — make it difficult for me to continue leading as effectively as I would hope and as the university deserves,” he wrote, according to the news outlets.\nHad the deal gone through at Florida, Ono stood to earn roughly $3 million per year in total annual compensation, about two and a half times his pay at Michigan. Under its terms, he made concessions that might have been nonstarters for other presidents. He would have agreed, for example, to appoint deans and a provost who were “firmly aligned with” the Legislature’s vision of higher education.\nADVERTISEMENT\nOno may have been struggling back in Michigan, but he was far from damaged goods in the eyes of the UF trustees who advanced his candidacy. Arguably more than any other public university in recent years, UF has embraced national rankings as a north star. Among trustees, you won’t hear any misgivings about whether U.S. News & World Report’s metrics are flawed or in tension with the university’s mission. In Gator Country, the rankings magazine keeps score. And Michigan has the lead. In that way, poaching Ono said less about him as an individual than it did about UF’s competitive edge.\n“The symbolism and substance of a sitting president of a university as prestigious as the University of Michigan choosing to come to the University of Florida should not be lost,” Hosseini, the UF board chairman, said days after Ono was voted down.\nIn U.S. News’s rankings, peer assessments count for a whopping 20 percent. Consequently, a university’s position is heavily dependent upon the story that the rest of higher education believes about it. Research prowess, faculty and student recruitment, and general vibes matter. For many years, these were the stories that people in Florida, including conservative politicians, cared about telling most.\nBut the Ono episode suggests that a different story has become the dominant one. It’s the story Governor DeSantis has been telling for years about Florida, and the story that President Trump is now telling about the country. It’s a story that casts higher education as an almost irredeemably lost institution, whose most seasoned leaders are to blame for propping up a brand of left-wing extremism that threatens the social order and the American way of life. Without even seeming to know it, Santa Ono entered that story, and wound up playing a lead role. He was, after all, a star.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

The former has long been the expositor of the meaning of academic freedom; the latter is active in litigating free-speech cases. The quarrel between the two organizations raises some hard questions about the AAUP’s current role.\nFrom its founding in 1915, the AAUP has gained the respect of the academic community and of the judiciary in explicating the meaning and application of academic freedom and tenure. Its work has had a significant impact on both. Its credibility has been earned by the consistent adherence to principle uninfluenced by exogenous policies or organizational ends, and by the sheer quality of its work. The latter was captured a half century ago by Judge J. Skelly Wright, who noted the “thoroughness and scrupulous care” in the AAUP documents placed before the court.\nRecent actions have departed from these standards — and radically. The AAUP, acting through its Committee A on Academic Freedom and Tenure, has, first, abandoned its prior position that systematic participation in the boycott of Israeli universities could threaten academic freedom and, second, declared that adherence to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) dictates as a condition of faculty retention can be consistent with academic freedom. These actions reveal a body now driven by considerations other than fidelity to principle. As a result, the deep well of communal respect has been drained dry; the AAUP’s credibility has been destroyed.\nCommittee A’s engagement with the call to boycott Israeli universities proceeded in two phases: a declaration strongly in opposition followed 19 years later by an about-face.\nThe story begins in 2005, when the British Association of University Teachers (AUT) called on its members not to cooperate or collaborate with two Israeli universities. The resolutions drew international attention. In response, Committee A placed the matter on its agenda. Its staff was asked to prepare a draft statement based on established policy for the committee’s consideration. The two-paragraph draft, which the committee adopted, condemned the AUT’s resolutions and called for their repeal:\nSince its founding in 1915, the AAUP has been committed to preserving and advancing the free exchange of ideas among academics and irrespective of governmental policies and however unpalatable those policies may be viewed. We reject proposals that curtail the freedom of teachers and researchers to engage in work with academic colleagues, and we reaffirm the paramount importance of the freest-possible international movement of scholars and ideas.\nAs the controversy continued, the committee responded by appointing a subcommittee to take a deeper dive. The subcommittee report, “On Academic Boycotts,” canvassed the issue in greater depth and in light of the texture of AAUP policy and experience. It set out a taxonomy of boycotts: “economic,” intended to injure the target financially; “symbolic and cultural,” intended to stigmatize the target, which might nevertheless have adverse consequences on third parties, on the earning capacity of writers and artists, for example; and “academic,” which strikes “directly at the free exchange of ideas.” Even though an academic boycott might call for noncooperation only at the institutional level, leaving individuals to their own devices, it “inevitably involves a refusal to engage in academic discourse with the teachers and researchers” housed in the targeted institutions.\nThe report’s conclusion was categorical: “We oppose academic boycotts,” albeit by institutions, not by individuals. The nature of what was opposed was further refined: Although academics are free to decide not to cooperate with foreign scholars or their institutions, when these individuals act collectively and the refusal “takes the form of a systematic academic boycott, it threatens the principle of free expression and communication on which we collectively depend.” That is, such group action could in effect come within the ambit of what Committee A opposed. However, the distinction between allowable individual and disallowed systematic group action was not further explained, nor the line between them explored. It should have been. In the event, that obvious lacuna was not addressed in the committee’s later action — even as the committee’s position was explicitly reversed.\nThere matters stood until the summer of 2024, when Committee A approved a statement that expressly “supersedes” the position adopted nearly two decades before. The new Statement on Academic Boycotts explained its raison d’être: The 2006 position was “controversial, contested, and used to compromise academic freedom. We therefore believe that this position deserves reconsideration and clarification.” Unfortunately, the reasons given for this reconsideration are threadbare, at best. The result is a tangle of inconsistencies and begged questions — without any reference to, let alone inquiry into, the role played by freedom of research and teaching on which the committee’s position rested a generation before.\nThe assertion that because the 2006 position has been “used to compromise academic freedom” it should be reconsidered could provide a valid reason for revision. But the report makes no mention of any instance, in press accounts or complaints brought to the staff, of any faculty member having been disciplined or threatened with discipline simply for advocating for a boycott. So “compromise” must mean something other than violation or abridgment, but the 2024 statement breathes no hint of what.\nAs we cannot find a guide to the meaning of “used to compromise” in the statement, we are compelled to look elsewhere. The chair of Committee A, Rana Jaleel, a professor at the University of California at Davis, essayed the notion earlier in “Teaching Palestine,” an article that appeared in a 2016 issue of the AAUP’s magazine Academe. We cannot know whether her thinking played a role in what the committee meant by “used to compromise,” but her essay is the only document we have that could shed light on it.\nADVERTISEMENT\nJaleel pointed to state legislation prohibiting public universities from doing business with companies that observe the anti-Israel boycott or that require entities under legislative control — university pension funds — to divest in such businesses. These laws, in effect, boycott the boycotters. She called on the AAUP to “push back” against these and all other laws that, she says, “cast any critique or less than favorable academic assessment of the Israeli state as discriminatory.” She demands the pushback “in the name of academic freedom.”\nThe sense seems be that legislative directives of this sort, even if at a remove from campus life, have the capacity to create an on-campus atmosphere so inimical to those who favor the boycott as to chill or, to use the statement’s phrase, to “compromise” advocacy for it. In other words, what the AAUP said in 2006 has to be reconsidered because advocates for the boycott have been put at a forensic disadvantage.\nThis argument is logically flawed and empirically unsupported. By its logic, were the state to accede to the demands of the boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement and divest university investments in companies that do business in Israel, those faculty members who oppose the boycott and wish to say so would have had their own academic freedom “compromised.” The only way that would not be the case would be to maintain that advocacy for BDS is protected by academic freedom, but advocacy against it is not.\nNor is there any factual basis for the claim that such legislation has actually “been used to compromise” academic freedom in that chilling sense. Illinois law, for example, directs its public-university retirement system to decline to invest in companies that observe the anti-Israel boycott and to divest in those that do. Yet at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the BDS movement shows no sign of abatement.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNevertheless, on these sinking sands the statement proceeds to ground a syllogism. The major premise: Violations of fundamental human rights abound across the globe, denying the right to life, liberty, religion, and much else. The minor premise: When faculty deploy an academic boycott against institutions of higher education in these countries in order to end or ameliorate these abusive conditions, academic freedom is not infringed. The conclusion: Individual faculty members should be free to “make their own choices regarding their participation.”\nThe conclusion would seem to be in keeping with the 2006 report’s recognition of “the right of individual faculty or groups of academics not to cooperate with other individual faculty members or academic institutions with whom or with which they disagree.” The difference lies in the fact that the drafters in 2006 took up the necessary next question: If individuals or groups have a privilege to decline to cooperate with foreign institutions, may they do so “systematically,” as, say, an entire departmental faculty, even as they declare it to be a personal, not a departmental, action? If the institutional/individual distinction is to be maintained, that question cannot be avoided. The 2006 report addressed it plainly: “When such noncooperation takes the form of a systematic academic boycott, it threatens the principles of free expression and communication on which we collectively depend.”\nThe 2024 statement declines to address the 2006 treatment of the systematic boycott directly, but it does so by indirection, and emphatically:\nCommittee A therefore holds that individual faculty members and students should be free to weigh, assess, and debate the specific circumstances giving rise to calls for systematic academic boycotts and to make their own choices regarding their participation in them. [Emphases added.]\nThis choice is asserted to be a matter of academic freedom.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe 2024 statement then extends academic freedom to participation in a specific kind of boycott. Unlike the taxonomy of boycotts given in 2006, the 2024 statement would seem to distinguish a primary boycott, an infliction of economic or reputational cost imposed on an actor to sanction the actor’s wrongful action, from a secondary boycott, where a party that has done no wrong is made a target of financial or reputational harm because it has a relationship to the wrongfully behaving actor in order to pressure the nonactor to pressure the wrongdoer.\nThe 2024 statement first embraces the secondary boycott full-throatedly, and then retreats from it without a word explaining why. It starts out by reciting a litany of fundamental human-rights violations in global terms, and states that faculty can support a boycott to “advance the … fundamental rights of colleagues and students who are living … under circumstances that violate … one or more of those rights”; that is, faculty can engage in secondary boycotts of institutions housed in countries whose governments violate rights against arbitrary arrest, detention, etc., for no reason other than that the institutions are housed there and that these violations affect faculty and students. But in its concluding sentence, the 2024 statement would restrict academic freedom to participation in the primary boycott: “Academic boycotts should target only institutions of higher education that themselves violate academic freedom or the fundamental rights upon which academic freedom depends” (emphasis added).\nThe statement makes no effort to connect the two assertions. It says faculty should be free to boycott on their own account, which fairly implies they may support a primary or a secondary boycott, but especially the latter in light of the litany the statement recites of human-rights abuses that cannot be attributed to the targeted universities — arbitrary arrest and detention, for example. But it then says that academic freedom extends only to participation in a primary boycott. The way it reads, a professor has academic freedom to engage in a systematic primary boycott, but not a systematic secondary one.\nA secondary boycott, if allowable, could rest on findings of human-rights violations by the Israeli government adequately documented by well-respected neutral bodies. The targeted universities need not be shown to have engaged in any wrongdoing. Not so the primary boycott. If Israeli universities are to be boycotted for their discrimination against Arab students and faculty — a matter much in controversy — the nature and extent of that wrongdoing should be found sufficient to justify the action. Unlike the process of an AAUP investigation wherein wrongdoing would be the subject of inquiry, the launching of a systematic primary boycott need not be founded on any process to assure the accuracy of the allegations, nor involve any opportunity for the targeted institution to defend itself. The issues of accuracy and fairness inherent in the primary boycott pass without Committee A’s notice.\nADVERTISEMENT\nNor did the 2024 statement attempt to explain how academic freedom applies. The 2006 report stated the boycott “threatens the principles of free … communication,” i.e., of the liberty of academic collaboration which the AAUP’s core document — the 1940 Statement of Principles on Academic Freedom and Tenure — assured. The 2006 report objected to the systematic group boycott on the ground that, akin to a boycott by the university, a systematic group boycott threatens (or compromises) the capacity of colleagues to freely decide what academic collaborations were best suited to their research and teaching. The 2024 statement emphatically rejects that reasoning, without a word of explanation.\nThen, there is the question of the AAUP’s position on so-called DEI statements. A number of universities have adopted policies governing faculty appointment, retention, and promotion geared to a sociopolitical end, i.e., to better achieve diversity, equity, and inclusion. Toward that end, at some institutions every candidate for reappointment, tenure, and promotion has to submit a statement explaining — and, for incumbent faculty, detailing — how, as one such policy puts it, the individual has “facilitated a diverse and equitable community in your teaching, mentoring, outreach, research, and/or service.”\nTo its advocates, the use of DEI statements is well within the prerogative of a university, especially when acting congruent with the sentiments of its faculty, to emphasize that aspect of its mission and to implement it in that way. To its critics, required DEI statements are parlously close to loyalty oaths, categorically inimical to academic freedom. As Ralph Fuchs, a former AAUP president, put it while the loyalty-oath controversy raged, even giving due allowance for the institution’s prerogative to chart its mission — “the essentiality of autonomy for academic institutions” — the “core of the matter” remains the “freedom of individual faculty against control of thought or utterance from either within or without” the institution.\nHad Committee A taken up DEI in keeping with its customary process of policy consideration in such a weighty matter, it would have assembled the data on what these policies actually provided, how widespread they were, and how they were being administered; engaged with the arguments on the relationship of DEI to academic freedom in the literature and in the deliberations of faculties, including those that refused to use them; and provided a clear, dispassionate analysis of how DEI stacked up against the 1940 statement’s commitment to freedom of research, teaching, and political engagement. It did nothing of the kind. Instead, it launched an aggressive defense of DEI accompanied by a strident attack on its critics, in all of six paragraphs and three conclusory recommendations. Each bears brief synopsis before the substance of the statement is addressed.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe first paragraph recites the AAUP’s support for affirmative action, which includes the promotion of diversity not only in the composition of the faculty but also in the production of knowledge, of opening “entirely new vistas of inquiry that were not possible without it” (emphasis added).\nThe second paragraph folds DEI criteria into this “broader vision,” thereby allowing “DEI criteria in faculty evaluation,” including the use of statements that “require faculty members to address their skills, competence, and achievements regarding DEI in teaching, research, and service” (emphasis added). It notes an AAUP survey in 2022 indicating that 21.5 percent of four-year institutions have included DEI criteria in their tenure policies and that another 39 percent were considering it.\nThe third paragraph notes the objection to DEI on academic-freedom grounds. The response then reads in its entirety:\nThis committee rejects the notion that the use of DEI criteria for faculty evaluation is categorically incompatible with academic freedom. To the contrary, when implemented appropriately in accordance with sound standards of faculty governance, DEI criteria — including DEI statements — can be a valuable component in the efforts to recruit, hire, and retain a diverse faculty with a breadth of skills needed for excellence in teaching, research, and service.\nThe fourth paragraph goes on at length to explore the role of the faculty in setting and applying standards for faculty performance and evaluation. It argues that DEI is in keeping with that traditional role when the policy is faculty approved.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe fifth paragraph attacks critics of DEI who use “sweeping or abstract criticism” of it to misrepresent, “often deliberately,” what it really does, which, to repeat, is to ensure “teaching, research, and service that responds to the needs of a diverse global public” (emphasis added). Faculty members are free to voice dissent, but “when an appropriate larger group” — a faculty committee, one would assume — adopts an “educational policy” by which an individual’s performance is measured toward these ends, the policy must be adhered to.\nThe sixth paragraph pursues the critics of DEI with greater vehemence. Attacks on DEI have gone “hand in hand with partisan … efforts to restrict or ban” the teaching of some subjects. Moreover, “attacks on DEI have played an integral part in the partisan political playbook to turn back the clock on advances that have been made toward the goal of diversity in the faculty, student body, and areas of study.”\nThe statement concludes by recommending that faculty be involved at all stages in developing DEI policies and, critically, that “meaningful DEI faculty work should be evaluated as part of the core faculty duties of teaching, research, and professional service.”\nBefore addressing the statement’s rejection of DEI’s incompatibility with academic freedom, when “implemented appropriately,” the manner in which the statement sets the stage should be noted: It stresses widespread acceptance; it denigrates those who are of a contrary mind; and it places dispositive weight on faculty approval. Let us look at each.\nADVERTISEMENT\nThe statement starts out by noting a staff report describing the broad extent to which DEI criteria in faculty hiring and promotion have been adopted, but it declines to note that the same staff report also found that over 39 percent of the institutions surveyed had decided not to consider such policies, nor that several months before Committee A issued its statement the Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard University rescinded its DEI-statement policy, as did the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The reasons for Harvard’s and MIT’s actions were never inquired into, let alone addressed.\nThe attack then impugns the motives of those critical of DEI, without naming or citing any of them. I myself am one such critic. I am also a former chair of Committee A. My analysis of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign’s DEI policy in terms of academic freedom appeared the year before Committee A’s statement, but it was ignored. Shortly before Committee A acted, but in ample time for it to take into account what was said, David M. Rabban, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law and a former chair of Committee A and AAUP general counsel, published a comprehensive work on academic freedom and the First Amendment — Academic Freedom: From Professional Norm to First Amendment Right (Harvard University Press, 2024) — that provided just the sort of dispassionate assessment one would have expected of Committee A. Rabban concluded that, on balance, the opponents of DEI statements had the better of the argument. Rabban is not a partisan for the repression of teaching. Committee A took no note of his work.\nThe statement then makes key to its endorsement of DEI that the policy be faculty approved. For academic-freedom purposes, faculty approval is and should be irrelevant; the heavy reliance placed on it is fraught with mischief. As a matter of sound institutional governance, faculty are accorded a primary role in the development and adoption of educational policies bearing on instruction, research, and faculty status; a faculty is accordingly expected to understand and respect academic freedom. But faculties can and have failed in that regard. When one does, Committee A’s role is to correct the error. In the past, it did so.\nIt is worth noting that a number of faculty members subject to the anti-Communist loyalty oath supported it, and a larger number were indifferent. The AAUP did not consider the depth of faculty support for the loyalty oath to have any bearing on its consequences for academic freedom. The reason is that the abridgment of academic freedom is a matter of fact irrespective of the status or motive of those effecting or acquiescing in it. The way Committee A has cast it, a DEI policy identical in every word would or would not abridge academic freedom depending only on the ideological or political proclivities of a majority of a bare quorum of “an appropriate larger group.” Faculty liberties cannot be made to hang by so precarious a thread. It should be enough to say of the right to exercise academic freedom what the Supreme Court said of the right to exercise freedom of thought and speech: It depends on no majority; it hinges on the outcome of no vote.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLet us step back to take the statement as a whole. Committee A has endorsed a policy that allows professors to be put to a Hobson’s choice: either compromise their judgment in teaching or research, or engage in officially approved political and ideological expression and association. In public universities it is difficult to conceive that this could possibly withstand constitutional muster, nor can it be reconciled with the 1940 statement’s assurance of professional and personal liberty. Committee A flatly “rejects” that conclusion, but it does so without any engagement with the 1940 statement, the source of its authority; in fact, the 1940 statement makes no appearance in this document. Instead, the committee attributes its support to the “needs of a diverse global public” without a moment’s reflection on the fact that if academic freedom can be sacrificed on that alter, the door is opened to any authority vested with legal control of the institution to declare what those needs are and to condition faculty retention on fulfilling them.\nIt seems inevitable that sometime, somewhere, one or more instructors will not be reappointed for no reason other than the failure to satisfy a DEI requirement. It seems equally inevitable that at least one housed in a public university will contest the decision on constitutional grounds; and, in that event, that the AAUP will appear before the court as amicus curiae. In that case, it would be expected that the AAUP will address the court much along this line:\nWe appear before this court as the repository of a century’s thoughtful engagement with the meaning and significance of academic freedom, to bring our considered judgment, expressed in the Statement on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Criteria for Faculty Evaluation, to the court’s attention and to argue in support of it.\nTo which the only frank response a court could make is: “You are the successor in title, but no longer in principle, spirit, or scrupulous care.”\nThis essay is adapted from an article originally published in Telos Insights.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.

But even among those institutions, can distinctions be drawn between the haves and the have-somewhat-lesses?\nThe small liberal-arts colleges in line for tax hikes think so. They comprise nearly half of the 31 institutions that would fall into the top three endowment-tax tiers under the budget bill that recently passed from the House to the Senate. Their lobbying strategy is coming into focus, our Sarah Huddleston reports. It might be summed up thusly: “We’re not the same as Harvard.”\nAt the core of their message: “We spend more of our endowment income than you might think.” Research behemoths like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and Northwestern Universities might draw between 20 and 40 percent of their operating budgets from endowment revenue, tapping into very small proportions of their investment earnings. But at small private colleges, the percentages can swell:\nPomona College’s endowment revenue contributed 49 percent to its operating budget.\nGrinnell College’s investment earnings cover 60 percent of its operations. It could see its tax rate climb from 1.4 percent to 21 percent.\nQuotable: “Endowments are our primary source of revenue,” said Anne Harris, Grinnell’s president. “We don’t have a D-I athletic team. We don’t have a medical center. We don’t have billions of dollars of grants.”\nThe colleges say much of their endowment spending goes to financial aid — something politicians on both sides of the aisle claim to want:\nSixty percent of Pomona’s financial-aid budget comes from its endowment.\nTwo-thirds of students at Smith College receive financial aid, which is financed chiefly through endowment interest.\nQuotable: “Essentially, it is a tax on the students who most need aid,” said Stacey Schmeidel, a spokesperson for Wellesley College, which estimates that a jump to a 14-percent tax bracket would be equivalent to fully funding 325 students.\nSmall private colleges are also touting their outsize role as economic engines. Many of the colleges are located in rural areas. Their endowment returns trickle into those communities, they say, in the form of jobs, grants to local institutions, and subsidies that encourage students to spend money off campus.\nThe jockeying over the endowment tax is now at its most intense. The House bill set the terms of engagement by capturing small privates in its trawl net. Now, as the reconciliation process truly gets underway, a coalition of two dozen such institutions have only a short time to make the case that they’d be bycatch.\nThe coalition is floating alternatives that would soften the financial blow they face. Among the options they’re trying to put on the table: different tax rates for colleges with fewer than 5,000 students, carve-outs for religiously affiliated institutions, and tax breaks for institutions that spend heavily on financial aid.\nThe big question: It all hinges on the Senate, long seen as a possible check on the House’s most aggressive impulses. At least some Republican senators seem interested in softening the endowment-tax hikes, as Politico has reported. But those lawmakers aren’t just motivated by sticking it to the Ivies. They also need to find a way to pay for planned tax cuts. How will they thread the needle?\n📱Read Sarah’s full report: Small Colleges Are Banding Together Against a Higher Endowment Tax. This Is Why.\nFederal news\nTax exemptions under threat: The Treasury Department is considering new rules that would revoke the tax-exempt status of colleges that consider race in admissions, scholarships, financial aid, and other programs. The revisions, drafted as new guidance to the Internal Revenue Service, could be implemented without congressional approval. President Trump and the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, have said they plan to strip Harvard University of its tax exemption, though the revocation process could take years. (Bloomberg, The Chronicle)\nRussian scientist released: Kseniia Petrova, a Harvard researcher, was freed on bail from federal custody by a magistrate judge Thursday. Petrova had been detained for four months after failing to declare frog-embryo samples she had brought into the country from a work trip in France. The Trump administration is attempting to deport her and continues to prosecute her on felony smuggling charges. (The New York Times)\nEd. Dept. was eager to outsource: As it fired a huge swath of its work force, the department reached agreements with other agencies to transfer services and even employees, court documents show. One deal would have sent billions of dollars to the Labor Department to oversee education grants; another would have detailed staff members to the Treasury Department to help run student-loan collections. Those plans have been on pause since a federal judge ordered the department to rehire employees laid off in March. (Politico, The Chronicle)\nGovernment climate site marked for death? Climate.gov, run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, will soon stop publishing new material after the feds terminated contracts with the site’s writers and producers. (The Guardian)\nQuick hits\nLawsuit attacks legality of HSIs: The State of Tennessee has joined Students for Fair Admissions, the group that successfully sued to abolish race-conscious admissions, to argue that a federal program disbursing millions of dollars annually to Hispanic-serving institutions is discriminatory. The lawsuit contends that Tennessee’s public colleges have been unjustly shut out of federal funding because they do not meet a threshold of 25-percent Hispanic student enrollment. (The Chronicle)\nFunding showdown looms in Michigan: The state’s Republican-controlled House and its Democratic-controlled Senate are worlds apart in their budget plans for the state’s flagship and its largest land-grant university. The Senate’s budget would slightly increase appropriations for the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor to $373 million; the House’s plan would slash funding by a whopping 91 percent, to less than $31 million. Michigan State University would receive $409 million under the Senate’s plan, and just $89 million from the House’s. The two chambers have until July 1 to agree on a budget. (MLive)\nA call to arms on accreditation: Accreditors must do more to enforce high academic standards and identify innovative approaches that serve students and colleges, according to a set of “bipartisan principles for accreditation reform” issued by the right-leaning American Council of Trustees and Alumni and the centrist Third Way. The groups argued that accreditation has become “a bureaucratic practice that offers few tangible, institutional benefits.” (ACTA, Third Way)\nTug of war over Wells College: Two alumni groups are battling to buy the institution in upstate New York, which shut down last year amid dwindling enrollment. One group, led by a former philosophy professor and running coach, has put in an $11-million bid to bring the college back to life; the other, led by an investment-adviser alumna, has offered $10 million with an escalation clause. (Bloomberg)\nLimestone’s closure leaves online students fuming: In April the South Carolina university told students to pay in advance for virtual summer courses. It initially said those courses would continue even as it shut down its brick-and-mortar offerings. But after a fund-raising effort failed, the college reversed course and canceled the online classes, too. Six weeks later, students who paid say they haven’t received refunds. (South Carolina Daily Gazette)\nOhio law fuels union dispute: A sweeping higher-ed overhaul signed into law in March has thrown a monkey wrench into collective bargaining at Central Ohio Technical College. The institution and its faculty union had reached a tentative agreement on a new contract earlier in the month, before the overhaul was signed. In light of the law, which calls for post-tenure review, prevents faculty from striking, and mandates “intellectual diversity,” the college’s president wants to come back to the bargaining table. Faculty say the institution has dragged its feet. (Inside Higher Ed)\nUndocumented students seek to challenge loss of in-state tuition: When the Department of Justice sued the State of Texas last week over a law granting in-state tuition to undocumented Texans, the state concurred and asked a judge to nullify it. Now a group of students are attempting to join the suit to argue that the law should stay on the books. (The Texas Tribune)\nFaculty handbook expurgates diversity: Missouri State University’s Board of Governors will vote tomorrow to approve revisions to the handbook, which include repeated deletions of the phrases “diversity” and “affirmative action.” (Springfield News-Leader)\nIowa board bides its time on DEI: The state’s Board of Regents has postponed until July a vote on a proposal to prevent public universities from making any courses deemed to teach diversity, equity, and inclusion or critical race theory content a requirement. Objections from faculty unions and a Democratic state senator prompted the delay. (Iowa’s News Now)\nQuote of the day\n“We really do believe that DEI initiatives stifle speech.”\n— Pano Kanelos, founding president of the University of Austin, said the start-up college’s social-media posts — including a video tease declaring that “DEI, ESG, and BS are out” and a message mocking course offerings at the University of Texas at Austin — do not violate its stance of institutional neutrality. Campus leaders have a “responsibility to speak” when political issues “intersect with the operations of the university,” Kanelos told The Chronicle’s Christa Dutton. “But I’m not going to make a comment about what’s happening in Ukraine, right?”\nRead Christa’s full interview with Kanelos: One Year In, What Has ‘the Anti-Harvard’ University Accomplished?\nWeekend reads\nColleges Can’t Trust the Federal Government.

Academic-program cuts seem unavoidable. Work-force reductions have been teased.\nAdd another casualty to the list: the Les Bolstad Golf Course. The system’s flagship Twin Cities campus has informed the Board of Regents — and city managers — that it plans to sell the 141-acre property, a mainstay of Saint Paul’s Falcon Heights suburb for nearly a century.\nOn the one hand, the planned sell-off is just one small data point in an escalating national trend. In an era of short-term budget crunches and longer-term fiscal uncertainty, myriad institutions are scrutinizing their land holdings, looking for high-upkeep, low-reward properties that can be turned into budget-balancing infusions of cash.\nOn the other hand, each of these decisions can leave a profound local impact. So it is with the Les Bolstad. It’s by no means a nationally renowned destination or a bucket-list course — though it was the site of the 1958 U.S. Junior Amateur Golf Championship, and Golf Digest says it “plays tougher than you might expect from a course that’s just 6,300 yards from the tips.” But as the mourning on this Reddit thread makes clear, it’s beloved by local linksmen, and by runners: The Roy Griak Invitational, hosted at the course, is one of the Midwest’s premier cross-country events for high-school and college athletes.\nPart of the charm and value of these spaces is the way they immortalize local legends. Les Bolstad, a Big Ten golfing champion in the late 1920s, went on to lead his alma mater as a coach for three decades. Roy Griak, a coach for more than 50 years, guided the Gophers to two cross-country titles. The golf course may be repurposed; the invitational may not live on. But hopefully the university and its city can find other ways to honor these native sons.\nADVERTISEMENT\nADVERTISEMENT\nMore News\n'Unrelentingly Sad'\nSanta Ono Wanted a Presidency.

Perlmutter June 13, 2025\nGetty\nThe first time I served on a faculty search committee, I felt awkward and unsure of my role. After all, we were looking to hire an assistant professor, and just two years earlier, I had been a candidate myself for the same type of position. What most stood out to me then — and still resonates all these years later — was a comment made by a senior professor on the committee: “Remember: If the candidates are good enough for us, then we have to show we’re good enough for them.

After all, we were looking to hire an assistant professor, and just two years earlier, I had been a candidate myself for the same type of position. What most stood out to me then — and still resonates all these years later — was a comment made by a senior professor on the committee: “Remember: If the candidates are good enough for us, then we have to show we’re good enough for them. This is wooing, not fraternity hazing.”\nIt made an impression because the department had treated me well during the hiring process, too — more like a future colleague than just a job candidate. And that was very different from the gauntlet of humiliation I’d been hearing from friends on the job market in my Ph.D. cohort. Since then, I have chaired my share of searches (including for three deans and a provost), overseen more than 100 faculty searches as an administrator, and heard the inside scoop on probably thousands more — and I still advocate for the importance of treating hiring as a mutual courtship.\nBut there’s a problem: A lot of search committees don’t seem to have gotten the message. Instead they view hiring as a one-way activity: It’s all about us. Candidates are expected to show their qualifications, demonstrate unwavering enthusiasm, and “prove themselves worthy of us.” I would like to think that such a retrograde notion is fading out, but, in truth, it stubbornly pervades academic hiring in this buyer’s market.\nIn the Admin 101 column, I write about all aspects of academic management, but certainly hiring is the most common and the most fundamental. Every hire seems especially vital in today’s financially stressed higher-ed economy. It falls to all of us, not just administrators, to emphasize that hiring is not just gatekeeping — it’s recruiting. It means putting our best face forward as much as the candidates do.\nTo that end, I am sharing here some practical steps that I have seen leaders and search committees take to improve the recruitment process. This month, I’ll focus on how to humanize the job ads and the candidate selection. In a followup column, I will concentrate on the all-important — for mutual wooing — campus visit.\nDon’t overload the job ad. Ten years ago, academics viewed the general reduction in the number of tenure-track positions across many public and private institutions as a crisis. Now that trend has moved beyond the crisis point to become an enduring and vexing reality.\nA natural consequence: When a full-time opening is advertised, it’s often overloaded with the qualifications and responsibilities that once belonged to multiple positions. Job ads today often resemble Frankenstein’s monster, cobbled together from various roles out of departmental desperation and internal compromises. I suppose it’s theoretically possible that an exceptional candidate might be found who can cover five responsibilities that once belonged to three different faculty members — but it’s unlikely. And candidates aren’t mind readers; they don’t know which of the five duties advertised are the ones that really matter.\nA simplified, straightforward hiring process would benefit both search committees and candidates.\nGiven the oversupply of candidates for too few full-time positions, you may think that it doesn’t matter much if your department’s ad has long, unrealistic lists of qualifications and job duties. But such job ads will scare off strong candidates, who know a recipe for disaster when they see one. Not to mention, a bloated position announcement tends to further stress the search committee because its members have to comb through an unwieldy pile of applicants, most of whom are not a good fit for the position you’re trying to fill.\nOne easy solution: Restrict the number of “required” and “preferred” qualifications you list in job ads. If you’re overseeing or chairing a search, persuade the committee to:\nSet a limited number of required qualifications for candidates — ideally, no more than four. For instance, a department hiring an assistant professor at a research university would list the main research area, secondary research area, main teaching area, and secondary teaching area.\nInclude no more than two preferred qualifications. Make clear that they fall into the category of “welcome but not required.”\nIf there are exceptions or additional skills you’re willing to consider, use phrases such as “open to additional areas” or “willing to consider X.”\nIn short, set priorities for the job and be explicit about them in the ad.\nADVERTISEMENT\nSlim down the search bureaucracy. Another factor that diminishes the interest and enthusiasm of strong candidates is an excessively cumbersome hiring process. That point has been made by many writers in these pages, including myself, yet search committees remain attached to hiring protocols of dubious value:\nWhy, in the initial stage of a search, require a list of references from each of the 100-plus candidates?\nWhy ask them to complete extensive questionnaires or fill out forms before the search committee had even reviewed their CVs?\nWhy ask first-round applicants to submit teaching, research, and other “statements” — all of which sound the same anyway, thanks to job Wikis, social-media sharing, and AI — until the committee has selected the shortlist of people who are actually a match for its required and preferred qualifications?\nA simplified, straightforward hiring process would benefit both search committees and candidates. Ask applicants for an assistant-professor position to submit a CV and a two-page (max) cover letter explaining their interest in, and fit for, the position. That should be enough for a committee to determine whether to continue the conversation. All of the other application materials can be elicited later.\nUltimately, the golden rule applies here: If you find a bureaucratic process frustrating and unnecessarily burdensome, why impose it on candidates, especially in the initial cull?\nADVERTISEMENT\nBe timely and efficient. In the past two decades, I’ve read a steady stream of social-media discussions about the most frustrating aspects of the hiring process in higher ed. One of the top complaints: The ways in which search committees communicate with candidates is not just random and inefficient but sometimes just plain cruel.\nI offer this embarrassing case study: As a dean, I was once mortified to discover that a job candidate had not been reimbursed, for months, for their expenses from a campus visit because I had mislaid a piece of paperwork. I called the candidate personally to apologize. I hope that was enough. It was a reminder to sweat those small details even more in the future.\nYour institution’s reputation for decency and courteousness must be built one search at a time.\nEven the most carefully planned search can be derailed by unexpected circumstances: A committee member may fall ill, a campus crisis may demand immediate attention, an array of scheduling conflicts may cause delays, or an honest and responsible human may forget a deadline or lose track of the paperwork.\nHowever, beyond such logistical hurdles, we must also acknowledge the cultural tendency in academe to treat searches as important but not urgent. Details of the hiring process are not always given the priority needed to press to a timely conclusion. This is where administrators can and should play a crucial role:\nEstablish firm deadlines for key steps of the hiring process, and be willing to police them to keep the process moving.\nHold meetings of the search committee even when some of the members can’t attend due to scheduling conflicts. Be ready to play the “well, I think we have covered all the issues, time for a vote” and “it’s too bad everyone can’t make the meeting, but we need to wrap up next week” cards to keep on schedule.\nSet specific standards for how, and when, the committee must communicate the status of the search with the candidates.\nEfficiency is also good reputation-building for recruiting. A sloppy hiring process demoralizes applicants and makes your institution and unit look bad. A very prominent colleague in the sciences told me how, at the start of his career, he got multiple offers but took the one from the department “that seemed the least scatterbrained.”\nCheck out The Chronicle’s latest advice stories\nBe good for goodness’ sake (and for the sake of your brand). In politics, an old saying goes: Some people make friends by the way they say “no,” while others make enemies by the way they say “yes.” A friend of mine embodied the former in his approach to faculty hiring. As a longtime chair of a humanities department at a liberal-arts college, he aimed to make every candidate feel like they were valued, even if they were not picked. He made sure candidates were updated in timely, cordial communications.\nHe never sent out obviously pasted-together rejection letters. While following HR guidelines about not getting too forensic in explaining why a candidate had not advanced, he made an effort to sound encouraging and to answer questions in a courteous manner. His approach made candidates feel they had been given a fair chance and were treated with decency and professionalism.\nADVERTISEMENT\nLikewise, many of today’s chairs and members of search committees are kind and considerate people who strive to engage candidates respectfully. But clearly, job forums prove the opposite treatment remains all too prevalent. And of course it’s hard to forget those bad experiences. I once attended a colleague’s retirement party where, out of nowhere, he expressed lingering bitterness over how poorly he had been treated on the job market — 40 years earlier. A simple attitude of politeness (or the lack of it) toward candidates can have a lasting impact.\nNo search is an island. Administrators must ensure consistency in efficiency, kindness, and attention to detail in the formulation of welcoming, reasonable job advertisements and communications. Your institution’s reputation for decency and courteousness must be built one search at a time. If you sour it by bad conduct, trust me, in this age of social media, that negative reputation will grow and hurt you in future hires.\nRead other items in Admin 101.\nWe welcome your thoughts and questions about this article.
