The company includes more than 600 professionals across 17 offices globally, with backgrounds across energy, finance and consulting, covering areas including power, hydrogen, carbon and fossil commodities.</p>\n<p>Dr John Feddersen, Founder and CEO of Aurora Energy Research, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This investment represents a major milestone along Aurora’s journey.  TPG Rise Climate’s portfolio is driving the energy transition forward globally and we’re delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this exceptional track record.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Ed Beckley, Managing Partner at TPG Rise Climate, added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“With increasing power demand across the globe, Aurora’s service offering has already proved invaluable, and we expect it to have strong growth prospects in the US, Asia, and beyond.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Information and software-focused private equity investor CGE led a management buyout of Aurora in 2020, and data and analytics fund 22C Capital also invested at the time. As part of the new transaction, CGE, 22C and Feddersen will all make significant reinvestments in the business.</p>\n<p>Chloe Holding Curtis, Partner at CGE, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We are proud to have supported John and his team at Aurora in its growth journey to date and are delighted to remain investors alongside management, TPG Rise Climate and 22C in this next phase of growth.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Launched in early 2021, TPG Rise Climate invests in climate solutions around the world, and across asset classes and sectors ranging from growth equity to value-added infrastructure, with investments focusing areas including energy transition, green mobility, sustainable fuels and carbon solutions. The strategy is part of TPG’s $18 billion global impact investing platform, TPG Rise.</p>\n<p>Jamie Gilbert, Business Unit Partner at TPG Rise Climate, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Increased visibility into data and analytics for the power industry will continue to be a strategic differentiator across the energy value chain, and we are excited to partner with John, CGE, and 22C to accelerate Aurora’s growth.”</p></blockquote>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/tpg-acquires-energy-software-and-data-analytics-platform-aurora/feed/ 0 Oxford, AICPA & CIMA Launch New Sustainability Reporting Course for Finance, Accounting Professionals https://www.esgtoday.com/oxford-aicpa-cima-launch-new-sustainability-reporting-course-for-finance-accounting-professionals/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=oxford-aicpa-cima-launch-new-sustainability-reporting-course-for-finance-accounting-professionals https://www.esgtoday.com/oxford-aicpa-cima-launch-new-sustainability-reporting-course-for-finance-accounting-professionals/#respond Mark Segal Wed, 04 Jun 2025 14:03:21 +0000 ESG Reporting ESG Tools, Services https://www.esgtoday.com/?p=20572 <p><img width=\"889\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3.jpg 889w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3-768x448.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3-610x356.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3-250x146.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px\" /></p>Oxford University’s Saïd Business School and accounting organizations AICPA &#38; CIMA announced today the launch [&#8230;] <p><img width=\"889\" height=\"519\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3.jpg 889w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3-768x448.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3-610x356.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Oxford3-250x146.jpg 250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 889px) 100vw, 889px\" /></p><p>Oxford University’s Saïd Business School and accounting organizations AICPA &amp; CIMA announced today the launch of the Sustainability Reporting and ESG Data Management Programme, a new executive management program focused on sustainability reporting strategies.</p>\n<p>According to Amir Amel-Zadeh, Associate Professor of Accounting at Saïd Business School, the new course comes as companies face a series of new sustainability reporting compliance requirements, and are moving from a voluntary reporting environment to mandatory sustainability reporting systems.</p>\n<p>Amel-Zadeh said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Finance leaders sit at the intersection of strategy, compliance, and value creation. Fluency in sustainability reporting and ESG data management is therefore key. This program equips finance professionals not only with the technical knowledge to meet evolving standards but also with the strategic insight to embed sustainability into the core of decision-making by translating ESG data into actionable insights.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Oxford, AICPA &amp; CIMA, the new eight week program, designed for senior finance team members, consultants, auditors and risk managers, is aimed at enabling professionals to develop, implement and enhance sustainability reporting strategies within their organizations, and to master sustainability reporting frameworks and standards including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) underlying the EU’s CSRD regulation.</p>\n<p>Key focus areas of the course include the integration of ESG data into decision-making processes, leveraging technology to create business value, fostering robust governance and control systems for sustainable growth, and identifying best practices in preparing for sustainability assurance.</p>\n<p>The program includes multimedia learning material, webinars, and optional weekly group sessions led by course tutors, with participants receiving a certificate jointly signed by Saïd Business School and AICPA &amp; CIMA upon completion.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Osborn, Global Head of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters for AICPA &amp; CIMA, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Accounting and finance professionals who complete this program will have the necessary tools to lead their organizations in sustainability reporting, employ best practices in meeting compliance with evolving regulations, and will have a better ability to anticipate trends in this rapidly maturing area.”</p></blockquote>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/oxford-aicpa-cima-launch-new-sustainability-reporting-course-for-finance-accounting-professionals/feed/ 0 DuPont Reaches 100% Renewable Electricity Across Europe https://www.esgtoday.com/dupont-reaches-100-renewable-electricity-across-eu-operations/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dupont-reaches-100-renewable-electricity-across-eu-operations https://www.esgtoday.com/dupont-reaches-100-renewable-electricity-across-eu-operations/#respond Emanuela Hawker Wed, 04 Jun 2025 13:01:22 +0000 Companies Energy Transition https://www.esgtoday.com/?p=20570 <p><img width=\"404\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont.jpg 404w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont-209x146.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" /></p>Multinational chemicals company DuPont announced a major milestone in its global sustainability journey, with 100% [&#8230;] <p><img width=\"404\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont.jpg 404w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont-209x146.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" /></p><p>Multinational chemicals company DuPont announced a major milestone in its global sustainability journey, with 100% of its grid electricity across all EU operations now coming from renewable sources.</p>\n<p>According to DuPont, the achievement has been made possible through the use of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and on-site solar energy. The company said that the announcement marks a key step towards its commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. DuPont has also set 2030 goals to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50%, Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services and end-of-life of sold products by 25%, and to source 60% of power from renewable sources.</p>\n<p>Alexa Dembek, Chief Technology and Sustainability Officer at DuPont, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“At DuPont, we are guided by a core value of protecting the planet, aligning our sustainability goals to meet the expectations of our customers, value chain partners and the communities in which we operate. Converting our EU manufacturing sites to 100% renewable electricity is a significant step in our journey to further reduce our emissions, lower the carbon footprint of our products and put us on a clear path toward decarbonization in our operations by 2050.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>DuPont currently operates 13 manufacturing sites across the EU, all of which are now powered by renewable electricity. These have included the installation of on-site solar panels and the purchase of bundled and unbundled RECs.</p>\n<p>The new milestone in the EU follows the company’s 2021 commitment to RE100, a global initiative led by the Climate Group in partnership with CDP, focused on bringing companies together via a pledge to power their operations entirely with renewable energy.</p>\n<p>DuPont’s <a href=\"https://www.dupont.com/news/dupont-publishes-2024-sustainability-report.html\">2024 sustainability report</a> further details the company’s progress toward its 2030 goals. As of 2024, DuPont had reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 58% from a 2019 baseline, exceeding its 2030 target and aligning with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C ambition. Scope 3 emissions were also down 39% from 2020 levels.</p>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/dupont-reaches-100-renewable-electricity-across-eu-operations/feed/ 0 Meta Signs Deal to Extend Life of Nuclear Plant for 20 Years to Power AI Growth https://www.esgtoday.com/meta-signs-deal-to-extend-life-of-nuclear-plant-for-20-years-to-power-ai-growth/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=meta-signs-deal-to-extend-life-of-nuclear-plant-for-20-years-to-power-ai-growth https://www.esgtoday.com/meta-signs-deal-to-extend-life-of-nuclear-plant-for-20-years-to-power-ai-growth/#respond Mark Segal Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:50:49 +0000 Companies Energy Transition https://www.esgtoday.com/?p=20568 <p><img width=\"828\" height=\"556\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta.jpg 828w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta-768x516.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta-610x410.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta-217x146.jpg 217w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px\" /></p>Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp owner Meta announced that it has signed a new agreement with [&#8230;] <p><img width=\"828\" height=\"556\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta.jpg 828w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta-768x516.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta-610x410.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Constellation-Meta-217x146.jpg 217w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 828px) 100vw, 828px\" /></p><p>Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp owner Meta announced that it has signed a new agreement with Constellation Energy, extending the life of a nuclear energy facility in Illinois for 20 years, with its 1.1 GW of output supporting Meta’s operations in the region, as well as the company’s clean energy goals.</p>\n<p>The new agreement, beginning in June 2027, will allow Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in DeWitt County, Illinois to be relicensed and to continue operating for another 20 years. The site entered commercial service in 1987, and was slated for premature closure in 2017 after years of financial losses, although the closure was postponed through mid-2027 by the state’s Future Energy Jobs Act, through support from a zero emission credit (ZEC) program.</p>\n<p>According to Constellation, the new agreement will essentially replace the ZEC program, and will also add 30 MW of capacity through plant uprates. The company added that it is also evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit from the to pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor (SMR) at the site.</p>\n<p>The agreement follows a deal last year <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/microsoft-signs-deal-to-restart-3-mile-island-nuclear-plant-to-help-decarbonize-data-centers/\">between Constellation and Microsoft</a> enabling the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Last year, Constellation’s announced plan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center became national news, but despite all of the interest and overwhelming support, a key question was missed: why did we let such a valuable plant close in the first place? We all know that the closure cost our community jobs, tax revenue, more pollution and higher prices. We are proud to partner with Meta because they asked that important question, and even better, they figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy. Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The announcement is the latest in a series of moves by Meta to turn to nuclear power to address the need for a rapid increase in electricity production to accommodate the growth in AI-driven data center capacity and power consumption, while protecting its goals to reduce the emissions impact of its operations.</p>\n<p>Meta has set targets to reach net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2030, and to continue to match 100% of the electricity used in its data centers and offices with renewable energy. In the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report, Meta said that while it has maintained net zero in its operations since 2020, its 2030 net zero value chain goal will be significantly harder to achieve, adding that “the challenge of reaching our sustainability goals given the increased demand for energy and resources driven by AI is not unique to Meta.”</p>\n<p>In late 2024, the company announced the launch of a request for proposals (RFPs) for nuclear energy developers in the U.S. to provide new nuclear capacity, targeting the addition of between 1-to-4 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear generation, with delivery to begin in the early 2030s. In an update provided with the Constellation announcement, Meta said that it has received more than 50 qualified submissions to its RFP from utilities, developers and nuclear technology manufacturers, and that it has shortlisted projects across multiple states representing the most feasible opportunities., with priority given to sites where nuclear development can be advanced quickly with high degrees of certainty on execution and timeline.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Meta, alongside companies including its tech giant peers Amazon and Google signed a pledge to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050.</p>\n<p>Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions.

Since then, it has evolved into a formal partnership of financial institutions and governments including Allianz, AXA, Zurich Insurance Group, Canada, France and the UK, which is focused on growing sustainable blended finance-focused investment opportunities across EMDEs.</p>\n<p>At this year’s conference, which took place this week, the coalition has said it is preparing the launch of a service provider company that will be focused on investment standardization.</p>\n<p>Achim Steiner, Administrator at the UN Develop Program, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We are in a time of uncertainty with rising geopolitical divisions, where development pathways are under pressure because of aid cuts, trade tension, and the debt crisis. What we need now is more cooperation, not less. It is in opportunities like the Hamburg Sustainability Conference where we find those critical touch points to take on big ideas, rebuild trust, advance innovative solutions, and forge meaningful connections across communities around the world.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The new company is expected to commence operations by the end of this year. It will be tasked with developing and establishing standardized financial vehicles that both public and private investors can utilise.</p>\n<p>It will also play a key role in matchmaking, bridging persistent financing gaps across climate, infrastructure and development sectors.</p>\n<p>SCALED expects the initiative to unlock billions of dollars in private investment over the coming years.</p>\n<p>The announcement came as part of a wider series of developments at the conference, which convened around 1,600 global leaders across government, business and academia.</p>\n<p>The Asia-Pacific Blended Finance Community of Practice was also launched. Serving as a regional hub to coordinate and mobilise blended finance solutions for sustainable development, it is expected to enhance collaboration, knowledge exchange and deal origination.</p>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/blended-finance-initiative-scaled-to-launch-platform-for-private-capital-in-emerging-markets/feed/ 0 BlackRock Removed from Texas Boycott List After Leaving Climate Groups https://www.esgtoday.com/blackrock-removed-from-texas-anti-esg-boycott-list-after-leaving-climate-groups/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blackrock-removed-from-texas-anti-esg-boycott-list-after-leaving-climate-groups https://www.esgtoday.com/blackrock-removed-from-texas-anti-esg-boycott-list-after-leaving-climate-groups/#respond Mark Segal Wed, 04 Jun 2025 10:14:15 +0000 Government Investors https://www.esgtoday.com/?p=20564 <p><img width=\"622\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2.jpg 622w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-610x305.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-260x130.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" /></p>BlackRock has been removed from a list of companies published by Texas subject to divestment [&#8230;] <p><img width=\"622\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2.jpg 622w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-610x305.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-260x130.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" /></p><p>BlackRock has been removed from a list of companies published by Texas subject to divestment for “boycotting energy companies,” after the asset management giant exited climate-focused investment groups and updated its energy investment policies, according to a statement released by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar.</p>\n<p>The development of the list in 2022 formed part of an anti-ESG movement in Republican states, which has gained further momentum since the election of President Trump, with Texas consistently at the forefront. Texas is the largest net energy supplier in the U.S., providing nearly a quarter of the country’s domestically produced energy, and accounting for over 40% of the nation’s crude oil proved reserves and production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).</p>\n<p>Under Texas law, the Comptroller is required to maintain and update a “list of financial companies that boy energy companies,” with the law giving companies given 90 days to “cease boycotting energy companies in order to avoid qualifying for divestment by state governmental entities.”</p>\n<p>BlackRock was one of the investment companies <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/texas-places-blackrock-credit-suisse-ubs-on-divestment-list-for-boycotting-fossil-fuel-companies-in-anti-esg-backlash/\">first included on the list</a> when it was launched by the Comptroller’s office in 2022. While Hegar welcomed changes made by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list and noted that “it took the company longer than others in the financial sector to make the shift,” each of the other investment companies included on the initial 2022 list remain on the updated list, expect for Credit Suisse, which has been acquired by UBS – which is also on the updated list.</p>\n<p>In a statement announcing the removal of BlackRock from the list, Hegar said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This is a meaningful victory and validates the leadership Texas has shown on this issue, which has seen a monumental shift in the way companies, governments and individual Americans view the energy sector.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Comptroller’s office listed a series of moves by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list, including the investment manager’s decision to exit the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative and to reduce its participation in Climate Action 100+, as well as reducing the number of fund offerings that prohibit investment in oil and gas. Hegar added that BlackRock “shifted away from blanket policies that ignore the critical need for fossil fuel-based energy generation now and long into the future.”</p>\n<p>15 companies remain on the Comptroller’s list, including AMP, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Danske Bank, HSBC, Impax Asset Management, Jupiter Fund Management, NatWest, Nordea Bank, Rathbones, Schroders, Societe Generale, Svenska Handelsbanken, Swedbank and UBS, in addition to hundreds of individual funds.</p>\n<p>In a statement provided to ESG Today, a BlackRock spokesperson said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We appreciate the Comptroller’s resolution of this matter. BlackRock is proud to help millions of Texans retire with dignity and, on behalf of clients, invests over $400 billion in corporations, local governments, energy infrastructure and other private assets throughout the state. These investments support the continued growth of the Texas economy.”</p></blockquote>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/blackrock-removed-from-texas-anti-esg-boycott-list-after-leaving-climate-groups/feed/ 0 Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production to Double in 2025, IATA Says https://www.esgtoday.com/global-sustainable-aviation-fuel-production-to-double-in-2025-iata-says/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=global-sustainable-aviation-fuel-production-to-double-in-2025-iata-says https://www.esgtoday.com/global-sustainable-aviation-fuel-production-to-double-in-2025-iata-says/#respond Emanuela Hawker Wed, 04 Jun 2025 08:20:41 +0000 Energy Transition https://www.esgtoday.com/?p=20562 <p><img width=\"1008\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow.jpg 1008w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-610x407.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-219x146.jpg 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px\" /></p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced that it expects sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) [&#8230;] <p><img width=\"1008\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow.jpg 1008w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-610x407.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-219x146.jpg 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px\" /></p><p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced that it expects sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production to roughly double to reach two million tonnes this year, but noted that this accounts for just 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption.</p>\n<p>Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.</p>\n<p>Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels. Although SAF usage needs to vastly increase, the growing cost to airlines is proving to be an obstacle, according to the IATA.</p>\n<p>Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to two million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/eu-adopts-laws-to-double-renewable-energy-share-decarbonize-aviation/\">the EU</a> and <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/uk-government-confirms-2-sustainable-aviation-fuel-requirement-beginning-2025/\">UK’s</a> SAF-focused mandates went live on 1 January. In Europe, this resulted in the cost of SAFs doubling, due to the associated compliance fees implemented by SAF producers and suppliers.</p>\n<p>For the expected one million tonnes of SAF purchases required to meet European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion, with compliance costs estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices, according to the IATA.</p>\n<p>Walsh continued:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The IATA has urged governments to create more effective policies that support clean energy production – like SAFs – while decreasing support for fossil fuels, while also ensuring the success of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) by making Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines.</p>\n<p>CORSIA was launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016 to address carbon emissions from international flights.</p>\n<p>To support the global development of SAF, the IATA <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/iata-launches-global-saf-registry-to-facilitate-global-sustainable-aviation-fuel-market/\">previously launched a SAF registry</a>, which is managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO). It introduced a more transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in line with existing regulations, such as the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS).</p>\n<p>In addition, the IATA’s SAF Matchmaker aims to facilitate SAF procurement by aligning airline SAF requests with suppliers.</p>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/global-sustainable-aviation-fuel-production-to-double-in-2025-iata-says/feed/ 0 TotalEnergies Acquires 435 MW UK Renewables Portfolio from Low Carbon https://www.esgtoday.com/totalenergies-acquires-435-mw-uk-renewables-portfolio-from-low-carbon/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=totalenergies-acquires-435-mw-uk-renewables-portfolio-from-low-carbon https://www.esgtoday.com/totalenergies-acquires-435-mw-uk-renewables-portfolio-from-low-carbon/#respond Emanuela Hawker Tue, 03 Jun 2025 16:03:34 +0000 Companies Energy Transition https://www.esgtoday.com/?p=20558 <p><img width=\"669\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TotalEnergies.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TotalEnergies.jpg 669w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TotalEnergies-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TotalEnergies-610x402.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TotalEnergies-221x146.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px\" /></p>Renewable energy company Low Carbon announced that it has completed the sale of a ready-to-build [&#8230;] <p><img width=\"669\" height=\"441\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TotalEnergies.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TotalEnergies.jpg 669w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TotalEnergies-300x198.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TotalEnergies-610x402.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/TotalEnergies-221x146.jpg 221w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 669px) 100vw, 669px\" /></p><p>Renewable energy company Low Carbon announced that it has completed the sale of a ready-to-build portfolio of eight solar projects with a combined capacity of 350 MW and two co-located battery storage assets with a capacity of 85 MW to France-based energy giant TotalEnergies.</p>\n<p>All projects are at an advanced stage of development, forming part of Low Carbon’s 16 GW pipeline, which includes solar, onshore wind and battery projects.</p>\n<p>Olivier Jouny, Senior Vice President of Renewables at TotalEnergies, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We are delighted with the acquisition of these projects from Low Carbon.

According to Amir Amel-Zadeh, Associate Professor of Accounting at Saïd Business School, the new course comes as companies face a series of new sustainability reporting compliance requirements, and are moving from a voluntary reporting environment to mandatory sustainability reporting systems. Amel-Zadeh said: “Finance leaders sit at the intersection of strategy, compliance, and value creation. Fluency in sustainability reporting and ESG data management is therefore key. This program equips finance professionals not only with the technical knowledge to meet evolving standards but also with the strategic insight to embed sustainability into the core of decision-making by translating ESG data into actionable insights.” According to Oxford, AICPA & CIMA, the new eight week program, designed for senior finance team members, consultants, auditors and risk managers, is aimed at enabling professionals to develop, implement and enhance sustainability reporting strategies within their organizations, and to master sustainability reporting frameworks and standards including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) underlying the EU’s CSRD regulation. Key focus areas of the course include the integration of ESG data into decision-making processes, leveraging technology to create business value, fostering robust governance and control systems for sustainable growth, and identifying best practices in preparing for sustainability assurance. The program includes multimedia learning material, webinars, and optional weekly group sessions led by course tutors, with participants receiving a certificate jointly signed by Saïd Business School and AICPA & CIMA upon completion. Jeremy Osborn, Global Head of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters for AICPA & CIMA, said: “Accounting and finance professionals who complete this program will have the necessary tools to lead their organizations in sustainability reporting, employ best practices in meeting compliance with evolving regulations, and will have a better ability to anticipate trends in this rapidly maturing area.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

According to DuPont, the achievement has been made possible through the use of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and on-site solar energy. The company said that the announcement marks a key step towards its commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. DuPont has also set 2030 goals to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50%, Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services and end-of-life of sold products by 25%, and to source 60% of power from renewable sources. Alexa Dembek, Chief Technology and Sustainability Officer at DuPont, said: “At DuPont, we are guided by a core value of protecting the planet, aligning our sustainability goals to meet the expectations of our customers, value chain partners and the communities in which we operate. Converting our EU manufacturing sites to 100% renewable electricity is a significant step in our journey to further reduce our emissions, lower the carbon footprint of our products and put us on a clear path toward decarbonization in our operations by 2050.” DuPont currently operates 13 manufacturing sites across the EU, all of which are now powered by renewable electricity. These have included the installation of on-site solar panels and the purchase of bundled and unbundled RECs. The new milestone in the EU follows the company’s 2021 commitment to RE100, a global initiative led by the Climate Group in partnership with CDP, focused on bringing companies together via a pledge to power their operations entirely with renewable energy. DuPont’s 2024 sustainability report further details the company’s progress toward its 2030 goals. As of 2024, DuPont had reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 58% from a 2019 baseline, exceeding its 2030 target and aligning with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C ambition. Scope 3 emissions were also down 39% from 2020 levels.

The new agreement, beginning in June 2027, will allow Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in DeWitt County, Illinois to be relicensed and to continue operating for another 20 years. The site entered commercial service in 1987, and was slated for premature closure in 2017 after years of financial losses, although the closure was postponed through mid-2027 by the state’s Future Energy Jobs Act, through support from a zero emission credit (ZEC) program. According to Constellation, the new agreement will essentially replace the ZEC program, and will also add 30 MW of capacity through plant uprates. The company added that it is also evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit from the to pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor (SMR) at the site. The agreement follows a deal last year between Constellation and Microsoft enabling the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania. Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said: “Last year, Constellation’s announced plan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center became national news, but despite all of the interest and overwhelming support, a key question was missed: why did we let such a valuable plant close in the first place? We all know that the closure cost our community jobs, tax revenue, more pollution and higher prices. We are proud to partner with Meta because they asked that important question, and even better, they figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy. Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.” The announcement is the latest in a series of moves by Meta to turn to nuclear power to address the need for a rapid increase in electricity production to accommodate the growth in AI-driven data center capacity and power consumption, while protecting its goals to reduce the emissions impact of its operations. Meta has set targets to reach net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2030, and to continue to match 100% of the electricity used in its data centers and offices with renewable energy. In the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report, Meta said that while it has maintained net zero in its operations since 2020, its 2030 net zero value chain goal will be significantly harder to achieve, adding that “the challenge of reaching our sustainability goals given the increased demand for energy and resources driven by AI is not unique to Meta.” In late 2024, the company announced the launch of a request for proposals (RFPs) for nuclear energy developers in the U.S. to provide new nuclear capacity, targeting the addition of between 1-to-4 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear generation, with delivery to begin in the early 2030s. In an update provided with the Constellation announcement, Meta said that it has received more than 50 qualified submissions to its RFP from utilities, developers and nuclear technology manufacturers, and that it has shortlisted projects across multiple states representing the most feasible opportunities., with priority given to sites where nuclear development can be advanced quickly with high degrees of certainty on execution and timeline. Earlier this year, Meta, alongside companies including its tech giant peers Amazon and Google signed a pledge to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta, said: “Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions. We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.
