Fluency in sustainability reporting and ESG data management is therefore key. This program equips finance professionals not only with the technical knowledge to meet evolving standards but also with the strategic insight to embed sustainability into the core of decision-making by translating ESG data into actionable insights.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>According to Oxford, AICPA &amp; CIMA, the new eight week program, designed for senior finance team members, consultants, auditors and risk managers, is aimed at enabling professionals to develop, implement and enhance sustainability reporting strategies within their organizations, and to master sustainability reporting frameworks and standards including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) underlying the EU’s CSRD regulation.</p>\n<p>Key focus areas of the course include the integration of ESG data into decision-making processes, leveraging technology to create business value, fostering robust governance and control systems for sustainable growth, and identifying best practices in preparing for sustainability assurance.</p>\n<p>The program includes multimedia learning material, webinars, and optional weekly group sessions led by course tutors, with participants receiving a certificate jointly signed by Saïd Business School and AICPA &amp; CIMA upon completion.</p>\n<p>Jeremy Osborn, Global Head of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters for AICPA &amp; CIMA, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Accounting and finance professionals who complete this program will have the necessary tools to lead their organizations in sustainability reporting, employ best practices in meeting compliance with evolving regulations, and will have a better ability to anticipate trends in this rapidly maturing area.”</p></blockquote>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/oxford-aicpa-cima-launch-new-sustainability-reporting-course-for-finance-accounting-professionals/feed/ 0 DuPont Reaches 100% Renewable Electricity Across Europe https://www.esgtoday.com/dupont-reaches-100-renewable-electricity-across-eu-operations/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=dupont-reaches-100-renewable-electricity-across-eu-operations https://www.esgtoday.com/dupont-reaches-100-renewable-electricity-across-eu-operations/#respond Emanuela Hawker Wed, 04 Jun 2025 13:01:22 +0000 Companies Energy Transition https://www.esgtoday.com/?p=20570 <p><img width=\"404\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont.jpg 404w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont-209x146.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" /></p>Multinational chemicals company DuPont announced a major milestone in its global sustainability journey, with 100% [&#8230;] <p><img width=\"404\" height=\"282\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont.jpg 404w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont-300x209.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DuPont-209x146.jpg 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 404px) 100vw, 404px\" /></p><p>Multinational chemicals company DuPont announced a major milestone in its global sustainability journey, with 100% of its grid electricity across all EU operations now coming from renewable sources.</p>\n<p>According to DuPont, the achievement has been made possible through the use of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and on-site solar energy. The company said that the announcement marks a key step towards its commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. DuPont has also set 2030 goals to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50%, Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services and end-of-life of sold products by 25%, and to source 60% of power from renewable sources.</p>\n<p>Alexa Dembek, Chief Technology and Sustainability Officer at DuPont, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“At DuPont, we are guided by a core value of protecting the planet, aligning our sustainability goals to meet the expectations of our customers, value chain partners and the communities in which we operate. Converting our EU manufacturing sites to 100% renewable electricity is a significant step in our journey to further reduce our emissions, lower the carbon footprint of our products and put us on a clear path toward decarbonization in our operations by 2050.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>DuPont currently operates 13 manufacturing sites across the EU, all of which are now powered by renewable electricity.

The site entered commercial service in 1987, and was slated for premature closure in 2017 after years of financial losses, although the closure was postponed through mid-2027 by the state’s Future Energy Jobs Act, through support from a zero emission credit (ZEC) program.</p>\n<p>According to Constellation, the new agreement will essentially replace the ZEC program, and will also add 30 MW of capacity through plant uprates. The company added that it is also evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit from the to pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor (SMR) at the site.</p>\n<p>The agreement follows a deal last year <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/microsoft-signs-deal-to-restart-3-mile-island-nuclear-plant-to-help-decarbonize-data-centers/\">between Constellation and Microsoft</a> enabling the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p>Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Last year, Constellation’s announced plan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center became national news, but despite all of the interest and overwhelming support, a key question was missed: why did we let such a valuable plant close in the first place? We all know that the closure cost our community jobs, tax revenue, more pollution and higher prices. We are proud to partner with Meta because they asked that important question, and even better, they figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy. Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The announcement is the latest in a series of moves by Meta to turn to nuclear power to address the need for a rapid increase in electricity production to accommodate the growth in AI-driven data center capacity and power consumption, while protecting its goals to reduce the emissions impact of its operations.</p>\n<p>Meta has set targets to reach net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2030, and to continue to match 100% of the electricity used in its data centers and offices with renewable energy. In the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report, Meta said that while it has maintained net zero in its operations since 2020, its 2030 net zero value chain goal will be significantly harder to achieve, adding that “the challenge of reaching our sustainability goals given the increased demand for energy and resources driven by AI is not unique to Meta.”</p>\n<p>In late 2024, the company announced the launch of a request for proposals (RFPs) for nuclear energy developers in the U.S. to provide new nuclear capacity, targeting the addition of between 1-to-4 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear generation, with delivery to begin in the early 2030s. In an update provided with the Constellation announcement, Meta said that it has received more than 50 qualified submissions to its RFP from utilities, developers and nuclear technology manufacturers, and that it has shortlisted projects across multiple states representing the most feasible opportunities., with priority given to sites where nuclear development can be advanced quickly with high degrees of certainty on execution and timeline.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Meta, alongside companies including its tech giant peers Amazon and Google signed a pledge to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050.</p>\n<p>Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions. We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.”</p></blockquote>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/meta-signs-deal-to-extend-life-of-nuclear-plant-for-20-years-to-power-ai-growth/feed/ 0 Blended Finance Initiative SCALED to Launch Platform for Private Capital in Emerging Markets https://www.esgtoday.com/blended-finance-initiative-scaled-to-launch-platform-for-private-capital-in-emerging-markets/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blended-finance-initiative-scaled-to-launch-platform-for-private-capital-in-emerging-markets https://www.esgtoday.com/blended-finance-initiative-scaled-to-launch-platform-for-private-capital-in-emerging-markets/#respond Emanuela Hawker Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:02:06 +0000 Sustainable Finance https://www.esgtoday.com/?p=20566 <p><img width=\"815\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled.jpg 815w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled-300x204.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled-768x523.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled-610x415.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled-214x146.jpg 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px\" /></p>A public-private coalition of major financial institutions and governments has revealed its plans to launch [&#8230;] <p><img width=\"815\" height=\"555\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled.jpg 815w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled-300x204.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled-768x523.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled-610x415.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Scaled-214x146.jpg 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 815px) 100vw, 815px\" /></p><p>A public-private coalition of major financial institutions and governments has revealed its plans to launch a dedicated company aimed at accelerating private investment in sustainable development projects across emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs).</p>\n<p>Blended finance brings together public or philanthropic capital and private funding through a common investment structure, enabling investors to invest in certain types of investments that have high perceived risk profiles, such as new climate mitigation-related technologies.</p>\n<p>The coalition – Scaling Capital for Sustainable Development (SCALED) – was first introduced as the Hamburg Sustainability Platform at last year’s Hamburg Sustainability conference. Since then, it has evolved into a formal partnership of financial institutions and governments including Allianz, AXA, Zurich Insurance Group, Canada, France and the UK, which is focused on growing sustainable blended finance-focused investment opportunities across EMDEs.</p>\n<p>At this year’s conference, which took place this week, the coalition has said it is preparing the launch of a service provider company that will be focused on investment standardization.</p>\n<p>Achim Steiner, Administrator at the UN Develop Program, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We are in a time of uncertainty with rising geopolitical divisions, where development pathways are under pressure because of aid cuts, trade tension, and the debt crisis. What we need now is more cooperation, not less. It is in opportunities like the Hamburg Sustainability Conference where we find those critical touch points to take on big ideas, rebuild trust, advance innovative solutions, and forge meaningful connections across communities around the world.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The new company is expected to commence operations by the end of this year. It will be tasked with developing and establishing standardized financial vehicles that both public and private investors can utilise.</p>\n<p>It will also play a key role in matchmaking, bridging persistent financing gaps across climate, infrastructure and development sectors.</p>\n<p>SCALED expects the initiative to unlock billions of dollars in private investment over the coming years.</p>\n<p>The announcement came as part of a wider series of developments at the conference, which convened around 1,600 global leaders across government, business and academia.</p>\n<p>The Asia-Pacific Blended Finance Community of Practice was also launched. Serving as a regional hub to coordinate and mobilise blended finance solutions for sustainable development, it is expected to enhance collaboration, knowledge exchange and deal origination.</p>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/blended-finance-initiative-scaled-to-launch-platform-for-private-capital-in-emerging-markets/feed/ 0 BlackRock Removed from Texas Boycott List After Leaving Climate Groups https://www.esgtoday.com/blackrock-removed-from-texas-anti-esg-boycott-list-after-leaving-climate-groups/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blackrock-removed-from-texas-anti-esg-boycott-list-after-leaving-climate-groups https://www.esgtoday.com/blackrock-removed-from-texas-anti-esg-boycott-list-after-leaving-climate-groups/#respond Mark Segal Wed, 04 Jun 2025 10:14:15 +0000 Government Investors https://www.esgtoday.com/?p=20564 <p><img width=\"622\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2.jpg 622w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-610x305.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-260x130.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" /></p>BlackRock has been removed from a list of companies published by Texas subject to divestment [&#8230;] <p><img width=\"622\" height=\"311\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2.jpg 622w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-610x305.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Blackrock2-260x130.jpg 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" /></p><p>BlackRock has been removed from a list of companies published by Texas subject to divestment for “boycotting energy companies,” after the asset management giant exited climate-focused investment groups and updated its energy investment policies, according to a statement released by Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar.</p>\n<p>The development of the list in 2022 formed part of an anti-ESG movement in Republican states, which has gained further momentum since the election of President Trump, with Texas consistently at the forefront. Texas is the largest net energy supplier in the U.S., providing nearly a quarter of the country’s domestically produced energy, and accounting for over 40% of the nation’s crude oil proved reserves and production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).</p>\n<p>Under Texas law, the Comptroller is required to maintain and update a “list of financial companies that boy energy companies,” with the law giving companies given 90 days to “cease boycotting energy companies in order to avoid qualifying for divestment by state governmental entities.”</p>\n<p>BlackRock was one of the investment companies <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/texas-places-blackrock-credit-suisse-ubs-on-divestment-list-for-boycotting-fossil-fuel-companies-in-anti-esg-backlash/\">first included on the list</a> when it was launched by the Comptroller’s office in 2022. While Hegar welcomed changes made by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list and noted that “it took the company longer than others in the financial sector to make the shift,” each of the other investment companies included on the initial 2022 list remain on the updated list, expect for Credit Suisse, which has been acquired by UBS – which is also on the updated list.</p>\n<p>In a statement announcing the removal of BlackRock from the list, Hegar said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This is a meaningful victory and validates the leadership Texas has shown on this issue, which has seen a monumental shift in the way companies, governments and individual Americans view the energy sector.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Comptroller’s office listed a series of moves by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list, including the investment manager’s decision to exit the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative and to reduce its participation in Climate Action 100+, as well as reducing the number of fund offerings that prohibit investment in oil and gas. Hegar added that BlackRock “shifted away from blanket policies that ignore the critical need for fossil fuel-based energy generation now and long into the future.”</p>\n<p>15 companies remain on the Comptroller’s list, including AMP, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Danske Bank, HSBC, Impax Asset Management, Jupiter Fund Management, NatWest, Nordea Bank, Rathbones, Schroders, Societe Generale, Svenska Handelsbanken, Swedbank and UBS, in addition to hundreds of individual funds.</p>\n<p>In a statement provided to ESG Today, a BlackRock spokesperson said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We appreciate the Comptroller’s resolution of this matter. BlackRock is proud to help millions of Texans retire with dignity and, on behalf of clients, invests over $400 billion in corporations, local governments, energy infrastructure and other private assets throughout the state. These investments support the continued growth of the Texas economy.”</p></blockquote>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/blackrock-removed-from-texas-anti-esg-boycott-list-after-leaving-climate-groups/feed/ 0 Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Production to Double in 2025, IATA Says https://www.esgtoday.com/global-sustainable-aviation-fuel-production-to-double-in-2025-iata-says/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=global-sustainable-aviation-fuel-production-to-double-in-2025-iata-says https://www.esgtoday.com/global-sustainable-aviation-fuel-production-to-double-in-2025-iata-says/#respond Emanuela Hawker Wed, 04 Jun 2025 08:20:41 +0000 Energy Transition https://www.esgtoday.com/?p=20562 <p><img width=\"1008\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow.jpg 1008w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-610x407.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-219x146.jpg 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px\" /></p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced that it expects sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) [&#8230;] <p><img width=\"1008\" height=\"672\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow.jpg 1008w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-610x407.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Airport-Heathrow-219x146.jpg 219w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px\" /></p><p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has announced that it expects sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production to roughly double to reach two million tonnes this year, but noted that this accounts for just 0.7% of airlines’ total fuel consumption.</p>\n<p>Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels.</p>\n<p>Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels. Although SAF usage needs to vastly increase, the growing cost to airlines is proving to be an obstacle, according to the IATA.</p>\n<p>Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to two million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Both <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/eu-adopts-laws-to-double-renewable-energy-share-decarbonize-aviation/\">the EU</a> and <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/uk-government-confirms-2-sustainable-aviation-fuel-requirement-beginning-2025/\">UK’s</a> SAF-focused mandates went live on 1 January. In Europe, this resulted in the cost of SAFs doubling, due to the associated compliance fees implemented by SAF producers and suppliers.</p>\n<p>For the expected one million tonnes of SAF purchases required to meet European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion, with compliance costs estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices, according to the IATA.</p>\n<p>Walsh continued:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The IATA has urged governments to create more effective policies that support clean energy production – like SAFs – while decreasing support for fossil fuels, while also ensuring the success of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) by making Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines.</p>\n<p>CORSIA was launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016 to address carbon emissions from international flights.</p>\n<p>To support the global development of SAF, the IATA <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/iata-launches-global-saf-registry-to-facilitate-global-sustainable-aviation-fuel-market/\">previously launched a SAF registry</a>, which is managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO).

These deals form part of the energy firm’s efforts to boost clean energy capacity and align with its overall commitment to reach more than 100 TWh of net electricity production by 2030 and net zero across the business by 2050.</p>\n<p>Roy Bedlow, Founder and CEO of Low Carbon, said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“We are very pleased to have finalized this agreement with TotalEnergies, who are making an impressive commitment to building renewable infrastructure and sees Low Carbon deliver one of the largest ready-to-build portfolios of solar and battery projects in the UK market.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Low Carbon currently has more than 1 GW of renewable capacity in operation and construction across the UK and Europe that is supported through a mixture of corporate power purchase agreements and (PPAs) and contracts for difference (CfDs).</p>\n<p>Low Carbon will be starting construction on an additional 400 MW of solar and battery projects over the next 18 months.</p>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/totalenergies-acquires-435-mw-uk-renewables-portfolio-from-low-carbon/feed/ 0 Energize Capital Raises $430 Million for Climate Solutions Venture Fund https://www.esgtoday.com/energize-capital-raises-430-million-for-climate-solutions-venture-fund/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=energize-capital-raises-430-million-for-climate-solutions-venture-fund https://www.esgtoday.com/energize-capital-raises-430-million-for-climate-solutions-venture-fund/#respond Mark Segal Tue, 03 Jun 2025 13:22:36 +0000 Energy Transition Private Equity & Venture Capital https://www.esgtoday.com/?p=20556 <p><img width=\"816\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital.jpg 816w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital-300x182.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital-768x466.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital-610x370.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital-241x146.jpg 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px\" /></p>Climate solutions-focused multi-stage investor Energize Capital announced today that it has raised $430 million in capital [&#8230;] <p><img width=\"816\" height=\"495\" src=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital.jpg\" class=\"attachment-post-thumbnail size-post-thumbnail wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" decoding=\"async\" srcset=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital.jpg 816w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital-300x182.jpg 300w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital-768x466.jpg 768w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital-610x370.jpg 610w, https://www.esgtoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Energize-Capital-241x146.jpg 241w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 816px) 100vw, 816px\" /></p><p>Climate solutions-focused multi-stage investor Energize Capital announced today that it has raised $430 million in capital commitments at the close of its Ventures Fund III, aimed at investing in digital technologies accelerating the energy transition.</p>\n<p>Despite a difficult climate investing environment, Energize said that the fund was oversubscribed, and was raised in just 16 months, drawing more than 80 investors, including approximately 75% institutional investors, mostly based outside the U.S. The fund is more than 30% larger than its predecessor Ventures Fund II, which closed at $330 million in 2023.</p>\n<p>Ventures Fund III backs early-stage companies focused on scaling energy and industrial transformation through digital and software-enabled solutions. The fund backs asset-light climate solutions, with a particular focus on companies operating in the industrial digitization, next generation infrastructure and energy transition sectors.</p>\n<p>To date, the fund has made five investments, including battery software optimization platform <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/tyba-raises-14-million-for-solution-to-maximize-value-of-energy-storage-projects/\">Tyba</a>, grid interconnection software platform Nira, and technology-enabled retail <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/resale-tech-platform-archive-raises-30-million-to-reduce-environmental-impact-of-retail/\">resale platform Archive</a>.</p>\n<p>According to Energize, the fund closing comes as technologies like AI are redefining capital processes, while economic changes including the reshoring of manufacturing, evolving global supply chains, and the accelerating energy transition are reshaping critical infrastructure, creating significant opportunities in areas such as grid interconnection, next-generation manufacturing, and the circular economy, with the fund looking to scale companies in these sectors.</p>\n<p>John Tough, Managing Partner at Energize Capital said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Now on our third ventures fund, the Energize team has been investing in climate technologies and solutions across several cycles, and we&#8217;ve experienced firsthand how this space has evolved in both market size and complexity. Today more than ever, operators need specialist investors with deep domain expertise and operational know-how to help them scale their solutions and achieve enduring growth. We are excited to back the next generation of entrepreneurs and are honored to be supported by a group of world-class Limited Partners who align with our mission of investing in climate solutions with ambition.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Chicago-based Energize Capital was launched in 2016.

The strategy is aimed at accelerating and attracting institutional capital at scale by offering return enhancement to encourage private equity investments in high growth climate opportunities across the Global South.</p>\n<p>In September 2024, <a href=\"https://www.esgtoday.com/tpg-raises-1-25-billion-for-global-south-focused-climate-solutions-investment-strategy/\">TPG announced</a> that it had raised $1.25 billion in initial capital commitments for its new Global South Initiative (GSI) strategy, including a $500 million commitment from UAE-backed climate investment platform ALTÉRRA, as well as from its TPG Rise Climate II fund. TPG has said that the GSI strategy has also received commitments from institutional investors across Asia and North America.</p>\n<p>TPG announced its first deal from the strategy in March of this year, where it acquired Siemens Gamesa’s onshore wind turbine generator manufacturing business in Sri Lanka and India.</p>\n<p>Rise Climate II, launched in 2023, has previously <a href=\"https://shareholders.tpg.com/static-files/9a1f8a2f-a1c4-419b-93bb-5318fb2636b4\">raised</a> around $5.5 billion in its own commitments – more than halfway to its hard-cap of $10 billion.</p>\n<p>TPG established its Rise fund franchise back in 2016 to target investment opportunities that deliver both a positive social impact and strong financial returns.</p>\n<p>TPG said:</p>\n<blockquote><p>“IFC’s deep capital allocation experience in emerging markets, alongside Altérra’s anchor catalytic capital commitment to the GSI strategy, will help to channel private equity capital to innovative and cost-competitive climate solutions, including those that are meeting demand for abundant, reliable, and clean energy, more sustainable materials and molecules, and adaptation technologies.”</p></blockquote>\n<span class=\"et_bloom_bottom_trigger\"></span> https://www.esgtoday.com/ifc-invests-100-million-in-tpgs-global-south-focused-climate-solutions-strategy/feed/ 0"

According to Amir Amel-Zadeh, Associate Professor of Accounting at Saïd Business School, the new course comes as companies face a series of new sustainability reporting compliance requirements, and are moving from a voluntary reporting environment to mandatory sustainability reporting systems. Amel-Zadeh said: “Finance leaders sit at the intersection of strategy, compliance, and value creation. Fluency in sustainability reporting and ESG data management is therefore key. This program equips finance professionals not only with the technical knowledge to meet evolving standards but also with the strategic insight to embed sustainability into the core of decision-making by translating ESG data into actionable insights.” According to Oxford, AICPA & CIMA, the new eight week program, designed for senior finance team members, consultants, auditors and risk managers, is aimed at enabling professionals to develop, implement and enhance sustainability reporting strategies within their organizations, and to master sustainability reporting frameworks and standards including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) underlying the EU’s CSRD regulation. Key focus areas of the course include the integration of ESG data into decision-making processes, leveraging technology to create business value, fostering robust governance and control systems for sustainable growth, and identifying best practices in preparing for sustainability assurance. The program includes multimedia learning material, webinars, and optional weekly group sessions led by course tutors, with participants receiving a certificate jointly signed by Saïd Business School and AICPA & CIMA upon completion. Jeremy Osborn, Global Head of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters for AICPA & CIMA, said: “Accounting and finance professionals who complete this program will have the necessary tools to lead their organizations in sustainability reporting, employ best practices in meeting compliance with evolving regulations, and will have a better ability to anticipate trends in this rapidly maturing area.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

According to DuPont, the achievement has been made possible through the use of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and on-site solar energy. The company said that the announcement marks a key step towards its commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. DuPont has also set 2030 goals to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50%, Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services and end-of-life of sold products by 25%, and to source 60% of power from renewable sources. Alexa Dembek, Chief Technology and Sustainability Officer at DuPont, said: “At DuPont, we are guided by a core value of protecting the planet, aligning our sustainability goals to meet the expectations of our customers, value chain partners and the communities in which we operate. Converting our EU manufacturing sites to 100% renewable electricity is a significant step in our journey to further reduce our emissions, lower the carbon footprint of our products and put us on a clear path toward decarbonization in our operations by 2050.” DuPont currently operates 13 manufacturing sites across the EU, all of which are now powered by renewable electricity. These have included the installation of on-site solar panels and the purchase of bundled and unbundled RECs. The new milestone in the EU follows the company’s 2021 commitment to RE100, a global initiative led by the Climate Group in partnership with CDP, focused on bringing companies together via a pledge to power their operations entirely with renewable energy. DuPont’s 2024 sustainability report further details the company’s progress toward its 2030 goals. As of 2024, DuPont had reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 58% from a 2019 baseline, exceeding its 2030 target and aligning with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C ambition. Scope 3 emissions were also down 39% from 2020 levels.

The new agreement, beginning in June 2027, will allow Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in DeWitt County, Illinois to be relicensed and to continue operating for another 20 years. The site entered commercial service in 1987, and was slated for premature closure in 2017 after years of financial losses, although the closure was postponed through mid-2027 by the state’s Future Energy Jobs Act, through support from a zero emission credit (ZEC) program. According to Constellation, the new agreement will essentially replace the ZEC program, and will also add 30 MW of capacity through plant uprates. The company added that it is also evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit from the to pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor (SMR) at the site. The agreement follows a deal last year between Constellation and Microsoft enabling the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania. Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said: “Last year, Constellation’s announced plan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center became national news, but despite all of the interest and overwhelming support, a key question was missed: why did we let such a valuable plant close in the first place? We all know that the closure cost our community jobs, tax revenue, more pollution and higher prices. We are proud to partner with Meta because they asked that important question, and even better, they figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy. Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.” The announcement is the latest in a series of moves by Meta to turn to nuclear power to address the need for a rapid increase in electricity production to accommodate the growth in AI-driven data center capacity and power consumption, while protecting its goals to reduce the emissions impact of its operations. Meta has set targets to reach net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2030, and to continue to match 100% of the electricity used in its data centers and offices with renewable energy. In the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report, Meta said that while it has maintained net zero in its operations since 2020, its 2030 net zero value chain goal will be significantly harder to achieve, adding that “the challenge of reaching our sustainability goals given the increased demand for energy and resources driven by AI is not unique to Meta.” In late 2024, the company announced the launch of a request for proposals (RFPs) for nuclear energy developers in the U.S. to provide new nuclear capacity, targeting the addition of between 1-to-4 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear generation, with delivery to begin in the early 2030s. In an update provided with the Constellation announcement, Meta said that it has received more than 50 qualified submissions to its RFP from utilities, developers and nuclear technology manufacturers, and that it has shortlisted projects across multiple states representing the most feasible opportunities., with priority given to sites where nuclear development can be advanced quickly with high degrees of certainty on execution and timeline. Earlier this year, Meta, alongside companies including its tech giant peers Amazon and Google signed a pledge to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta, said: “Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions. We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Blended finance brings together public or philanthropic capital and private funding through a common investment structure, enabling investors to invest in certain types of investments that have high perceived risk profiles, such as new climate mitigation-related technologies. The coalition – Scaling Capital for Sustainable Development (SCALED) – was first introduced as the Hamburg Sustainability Platform at last year’s Hamburg Sustainability conference. Since then, it has evolved into a formal partnership of financial institutions and governments including Allianz, AXA, Zurich Insurance Group, Canada, France and the UK, which is focused on growing sustainable blended finance-focused investment opportunities across EMDEs. At this year’s conference, which took place this week, the coalition has said it is preparing the launch of a service provider company that will be focused on investment standardization. Achim Steiner, Administrator at the UN Develop Program, said: “We are in a time of uncertainty with rising geopolitical divisions, where development pathways are under pressure because of aid cuts, trade tension, and the debt crisis. What we need now is more cooperation, not less. It is in opportunities like the Hamburg Sustainability Conference where we find those critical touch points to take on big ideas, rebuild trust, advance innovative solutions, and forge meaningful connections across communities around the world.” The new company is expected to commence operations by the end of this year. It will be tasked with developing and establishing standardized financial vehicles that both public and private investors can utilise. It will also play a key role in matchmaking, bridging persistent financing gaps across climate, infrastructure and development sectors. SCALED expects the initiative to unlock billions of dollars in private investment over the coming years. The announcement came as part of a wider series of developments at the conference, which convened around 1,600 global leaders across government, business and academia. The Asia-Pacific Blended Finance Community of Practice was also launched. Serving as a regional hub to coordinate and mobilise blended finance solutions for sustainable development, it is expected to enhance collaboration, knowledge exchange and deal origination.

Located in the south of England, they benefit from favorable sunlight and complement our integrated electricity portfolio in the UK, which includes 1.1 GW of gross installed offshore wind, 1.3 GW of gross combined cycle gas turbine, and more than 600 MW of solar projects under development.” The acquired projects should be operational by 2028, producing more than 350 GWh of renewable electricity per year – the equivalent energy consumption of 100,000 UK households annually. This purchase follows a series of transactions made over the last few months by TotalEnergies, including the closing of three acquisitions in Europe, Africa and Canada. These deals form part of the energy firm’s efforts to boost clean energy capacity and align with its overall commitment to reach more than 100 TWh of net electricity production by 2030 and net zero across the business by 2050. Roy Bedlow, Founder and CEO of Low Carbon, said: “We are very pleased to have finalized this agreement with TotalEnergies, who are making an impressive commitment to building renewable infrastructure and sees Low Carbon deliver one of the largest ready-to-build portfolios of solar and battery projects in the UK market.” Low Carbon currently has more than 1 GW of renewable capacity in operation and construction across the UK and Europe that is supported through a mixture of corporate power purchase agreements and (PPAs) and contracts for difference (CfDs). Low Carbon will be starting construction on an additional 400 MW of solar and battery projects over the next 18 months.

Announced at SAP’s annual customer event, Sapphire, several of the new tools will form part of the company’s recently released Business Data Cloud (BDC) solution, which is designed to unify data from SAP applications and third-party sources. SAP said that a new range of sustainability data products will be available as part of the BDC solution, including environment, health, and safety management product compliance data products, which will provide structured, validated, and governed information on air, water, and wastewater emissions. Additionally, SAP said that more sustainability data products will be integrated into BDC later in 2025, including data from its corporate and product carbon footprint calculation solution, SAP Sustainability Footprint Management, and that SAP Sustainability Control Tower (SCT) will be available on SAP BDC later this year as part of a limited customer release. Launched in 2021, SAP Sustainability Control Tower was designed as a central location for all sustainability data at enterprises, aimed at helping companies monitor and manage sustainability performance. SAP also announced a series of new capabilities for its business process transformation suite, SAP Signavio, including embedding sustainability metrics, such as the ability to track and analyze carbon emissions across business processes. The company said that the new capabilities will be generally available in Q4 2025. Sophia Mendelsohn, Chief Sustainability and Commercial Officer at SAP, said: “Organizations often don’t realize how much sustainability data is already at their fingertips, hidden in procurement logs, operational systems, and supplier records. We’ve seen a tendency to zero in on carbon metrics, while overlooking equally important areas like resource use or supplier practices. At SAP, we’re uniquely positioned to connect these dots thanks to the breadth and depth of our data foundation. This year at Sapphire, we’re introducing new tools that help companies uncover the data they didn’t know they had, so they can unify them in one system and act on it more effectively.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The EBA said that its new proposals align with the initiatives of the European Commission to simplify sustainability reporting, such as the Commission’s Omnibus package. The EBA said: “In line with the European Commission’s omnibus proposal to reduce reporting costs and simplify sustainability reporting, the EBA has designed a proportionate approach for ESG disclosures based on the institution’s type, size and complexity, with simplified disclosures for banks other than large, particularly for those that are small or non-listed.” The EBA added that it also aims to simplify ESG reporting for large banks ”by clarifying the existing requirements based on the experience gained.” The EBA’s new proposals follow the publication by the EU in 2024 of a Banking Package (CRR3), which included changes to reporting requirements for banks beginning in 2025, including extending the scope of ESG risks-related disclosures from only large institutions to all institutions, in areas such as environmental physical risks and transition risks. Additional new ESG-related reporting requirements under the banking package include separate disclosure of environmental physical and transition risks, and their social and governance risks, total exposure to fossil fuel sector entities, and disclosures on how institutions integrate the identified ESG risks in their business strategy and processes, and governance and risk management. Under the EBA’s new proposals, separate disclosure requirements will be introduced for institutions, with large institutions subject to the “full set of information,” other listed institutions and large subsidiaries subject to the “simplified set of information,” and small and non-complex institutions (SNCIs) subject to an “essential set of information.” Examples of the differences between the information sets include semi-annual reporting on “Climate Change transition risk: Credit quality of exposures by sector, emissions and residual maturity” for large institutions, compared with annual reporting for other listed institutions and large subsidiaries, and a separate “Transition and physical risk for SNCI” annual disclosure for SNCIs. Large bank reporting requirements also include disclosure of their green asset ratio (GAR), or the share of assets aligned with sustainable activities, with the EBA’s new proposals ensuring full alignment of the GAR with the EU’s Taxonomy regulation. The EBA is also proposing introducing the possibility of reducing the frequency of some disclosures for large banks based on materiality reasons. The EBA launched a public consultation on the new proposals, with submissions due by August 22, 2025. Click here to access the consultation paper.

    "content": "ECB Warns EU Against Removing 80% of Companies from Mandatory Sustainability Reporting - ESG Today ESG Investing, sustainable finance & business sustainability news ESG investing news, analysis, research and information Top Stories ESG News Companies Government Investors Regulators Sustainable Finance ESG Solutions ESG Tools, Services Companies Companies Investors Investors ESG Disclosure ESG Reporting Analysis Regulators Reports, Studies Newsfeed Resources Events About About us Our Team Advertise With Us ESG Reporting / Government / Regulators ECB Warns EU Against Removing 80% of Companies from Mandatory Sustainability Reporting Mark Segal May 12, 2025 The European Central Bank (ECB) released a new opinion on the European Commission’s proposals to simplify and reduce sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements for companies. While welcoming the goal of simplifying requirements for companies, the ECB warned that some of the Commission’s plans could significantly increase risks for investors, the economy and the EU’s sustainability goals. Among the key recommendations in the central bank’s opinion was a proposal to significantly limit the planned reduction in scope of the companies covered by the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), with the ECB recommending mandatory sustainability reporting requirements for companies with 500 or more employees. The ECB’s publication follows the release in late February of the Commission’s Omnibus I package , aimed at significantly reducing the sustainability reporting and regulatory burden on companies, with proposals for major changes to a series of regulations including the CSRD, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), as well as the Taxonomy Regulation, and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CSRD was initially planned as a major update to the EU’s Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), the previous EU sustainability reporting framework, significantly expanding the number of companies required to provide sustainability disclosures to over 50,000 from around 12,000. Based on new underlying European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), the CSRD also introduces more detailed reporting requirements on company impacts on the environment, human rights and social standards and sustainability-related risk. The omnibus proposals, however, would significantly change the scope and coverage of the CSRD. Key proposed changes to the CSRD in the package include a dramatic reduction in scope, moving the regulation to cover only companies with more than 1,000 employees and either revenue greater than €50 million net turnover, removing an estimated 80% of companies from the regulation’s sustainability reporting requirements. In addition to the move to remove most companies from the CSRD, the Commission also plans to revise the ESRS, with the aim of substantially reducing the number of data points required by the sustainability reporting standards. In the central bank’s opinion, while the ECB states that it “supports the Commission’s efforts to streamline and simplify sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements,” it notes that “the availability of harmonised, standardised and reliable sustainability information” is essential to help ensure the flow of capital to activities supporting the EU’s sustainability goals, and to allow “market participants to understand and price sustainability-related financial risks,” while preventing “investment decisions being taken on the basis of incomplete information.” For its own role, the ECB noted that the availability of high-quality sustainability-related information is required for its roles in ensuring financial stability and managing monetary policy, stating that “physical and transition risks related to the climate and nature crises have profound implications for both price and financial stability through their impacts on the structure and cyclical dynamics of the economy and the financial system.” The ECB opinion takes issue with the Omnibus’s proposed reduction in scope, removing 80% of companies from coverage under the CSRD, stating that “this amendment could significantly limit stakeholders’ access to important information,” and warning of “unwanted outcomes,” including reducing the overall availability of sustainability information, including information on GHG emissions – noting that some significant emitters, including fossil fuel companies, will fall outside the scope of reporting. The ECB also warned that some companies currently providing sustainability information under the NFRD system will no longer be covered under the CSRD, as well as many credit institutions, with the ECB stating that “it is worth noting that ESG risks are not necessarily proportionate to an institution’s size.” In its opinion, the ECB suggests changes to the Omnibus proposal, recommending that instead of cutting off companies smaller than 1,000 employees from the scope of the CSRD, companies with 500-1,000 employees also be subject to mandatory sustainability reporting requirements, but applying “dedicated simplified sustainability reporting standards that are proportionate and relevant to the capacities and the characteristics of such undertakings and to the scale and complexity of their activities.” The ECB also notes that the Omnibus proposal to increase the scope of third-country companies covered by the CSRD would generate data gaps between EU and non-EU companies and create a competitive disadvantage for EU companies, and recommends that this proposal be eliminated. While welcoming the EU’s proposal to establish voluntary sustainability reporting standards for smaller companies not under the scope of the CSRD, the ECB also warns of potential dangers, such as self-selection, with only companies performing well choosing to report, and greenwashing risk from companies selectively choosing which sustainability aspects to report. The ECB proposes suggestions for the initiative to reduce the ESRS data points, noting that it its important to “retain data points that are relevant from the prudential and monetary policy perspectives.” Specifically, the ECB recommends retaining most climate change data points (ESRS E1), along with important biodiversity and ecosystems data points (ESRS E4), as these are particularly important essential for assessing and managing physical and transition risks for companies and financial institutions. Among the changes introduced by the Commission with its Omnibus proposal was an announcement that it will not introduce planned sector-specific sustainability reporting standards under the CSRD. The ECB, however, notes the importance of sector-specific information, such as for allowing financial institutions to assess and compare companies in the same sector on transition preparation. In its opinion, the ECB recommends that in the absence of sector-specific standards, the Commission should “consider adopting sector-specific guidelines in order to foster a common approach to implementing the ESRS within individual sectors. “ Click here to access the ECB opinion.

The NGFS was established in 2017, with the purpose of helping to strengthen the global response required to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and to enhance the role of the financial system to manage risks and to mobilize capital for green and low-carbon investments in the broader context of environmentally sustainable development. The organization provides science-based insights aimed at helping financial systems to navigate climate and nature-related risks. The NGFS’s key tools include its long-term climate scenarios – reflecting possible future climate policies, and assessing physical risks, including heat, drought and floods, and short and long-term risks stemming from the transition to a greener economy such as increasing carbon prices – which are used by many central banks worldwide in climate stress tests for banking and financial systems. According to the NGFS, the new short-term scenarios focus on a five- year time horizon, and offer detailed sector analysis and extensive coverage of financial risk and macroeconomic variables, exploring the interaction of factors including climate policies, extreme weather, economic trends and sectoral shifts. Among the key feature of the new scenarios highlighted by the NGFS include the accounting of compound physical climate risks, exploring how a sequence of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, wildfires, and storms could impact economies, including supply chain breakdowns. The scenarios also integrate climate policy, extreme weather events, economic trends and sectoral dynamics to provide scenarios that reflect the interaction of climate risks and business cycles, the organization added. In a presentation announcing the launch of the scenarios, the NGFS said: “With a focus on the next five years, the scenarios are particularly useful for financial sector applications, such as stress testing, risk assessment, and guiding policy calibration.” The new release includes four sets of scenarios, including one focusing only on physical risk, two transition risk only scenarios, and one scenario combining physical and transition risks. “Disasters and Policy Stagnation,” the physical risk scenario explores the economic and financial consequences of extreme but plausible weather events. The transition only scenarios include “Highway to Paris” which envisions an orderly, technology-driven gradual transition, and “Sudden Wake-Up Call,” in which there is a sudden change in policy preferences and consumer and investor preferences towards green sectors. “Diverging Realities,” considering physical and transition risk, sees advanced economies pursuing a “Highway to Paris” aligned scenario, while other economies are hit by extreme weather events, creating supply chain disruptions and raising the cost of the low-carbon transition. In the presentation on the new scenarios, NGFS Chair Sabine Mauderer and Chair of the workstream on Scenario Design and Analysis Livio Stracca said: “Robust and actionable climate risk analysis is essential for the global economy to navigate the climate challenge. Financial actors and policymakers must gain a deeper understanding of climaterelated risks in order to prepare for them appropriately. The NGFS short-term scenarios are hence a vital instrument for conducting risk assessments and making informed decisions with greater confidence.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Synergies with existing industrial processes present new opportunities to implement carbon removal methods as a means of improving efficiency, productivity, and revenue, while meeting regulatory demands. RMI’s recent report, Seizing the Industrial Carbon Removal Opportunity, highlights the case for why industrial leaders should act now to develop and deploy carbon removal technologies within industrial value chains —and how doing so can deliver both environmental and economic returns. Reason 1: Commercial and climate imperatives to support carbon removal are converging Pressures on heavy industry to both reduce and remove emissions are intensifying due to evolving regulatory landscapes and shifting market demands. They will likely continue to increase over the coming decades. Developing and integrating carbon removal provides industrial companies with an additional and complementary set of tools for addressing these pressures. Initial piloting activities of carbon removal technologies, such as integrating carbon capture into desalination , pulp and paper, wastewater , and mining facilities, are showing that this does not necessarily need to cost industrial companies money. Proactive engagement with CDR offers tangible commercial opportunities, from improving efficiency, accessing nascent carbon markets, and generating green product premiums. It could also help mitigate future regulatory risks and potential carbon tax obligations. This isn’t just about environmental responsibility; it’s about smart commercial strategy in an uncertain world. Reason 2: Industries can leverage existing assets and synergies to have impact Incorporating carbon removal does not necessarily require radical overhauls or disruptive technologies. Our report highlights that many heavy industries possess underutilized assets and inherent synergies that can be leveraged for carbon removal and even further emissions reductions. For example, waste streams from agriculture and forestry, construction and demolition, desalination, mining, steel, or wastewater processing can be put to use for long-term carbon removal and storage. Physical infrastructure in those industries and others can be made more productive by integrating CDR activities. This requires innovation in processes, operations, and business models. But it does not necessarily require scientific and technological leaps. Smart innovation within existing operational frameworks, using existing assets, can enhance early adopters’ near-term performance and long-term growth and resilience. Reason 3: Investing now in carbon removal can future-proof your business Investing in carbon removal now is an investment in future-proofing operations against a changing world and business environment. Relevant key trends include greater national prioritization of industrial innovation and growth, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and growing markets for removing carbon from the air. Companies that proactively integrate carbon removal into their operations will be better informed on carbon removal technology and operationalization and better positioned to navigate these trends and maintain their relevance and competitiveness over the long haul. How industries can get engaged with carbon removal Here are the actionable steps heavy industries should consider: Assess the carbon removal opportunity for your business, evaluating existing relevant operations and assets. Collaborate with other stakeholders to form new relationships and build knowledge. Invest in research, development and demonstration, allocating resources to pilot projects and demonstrations. Update your commercial goals to integrate carbon removal insights and create separate targets for decarbonization and carbon removal. These steps will unlock opportunities to integrate carbon removal into existing industrial processes, drive greater efficiency, productivity, and help companies meet tightening regulatory requirements.

Now is the time to double down on climate action. In the long arc of history, progress rarely travels in a straight line. But in moments of crisis, retreat can carry profound consequences. Europe now finds itself at one of those moments. The European Union is showing signs of reversing course on environmental policy—just when it should be accelerating. The European Commission’s proposed Omnibus Simplification Package represents a significant weakening of green legislation, most notably a dramatic scaling back of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Far from a necessary simplification, this move threatens to undo years of environmental leadership, undermine corporate transparency, and jeopardize long-term economic resilience. A Dangerous Step Backwards The CSRD, only recently enacted, is central to the EU’s broader sustainability strategy. It requires large and listed companies to report standardized data on environmental, social, and governance performance—creating a consistent and transparent foundation for investors, regulators, and the public. Yet under the Omnibus proposal, the scope of the CSRD would shrink drastically. New analysis from CDP reveals that of the 11,000 companies that reported environmental data through the full 2024 CDP questionnaire, 83% (9,181 companies) would have met the original CSRD requirements. Under the proposed changes, that figure drops to 5,465—a 40% reduction. Thousands of companies already demonstrating transparency and responsibility would be exempted from future obligations. This is not streamlining. It is backsliding. It strips investors of the environmental risk data they need to make informed decisions. It undercuts businesses that have invested heavily in disclosure and sustainability. And most alarmingly, it could threaten financial stability in the Eurozone—as European Central Bank supervisors have explicitly warned . Sustainability Is a Competitive Advantage In April, the Commission announced delays in applying parts of the CSRD and due diligence requirements. Paired with the proposal to remove around 80% of companies from the directive’s scope, these decisions risk dismantling the policy foundation that supports stable, sustainable finance markets across Europe. Built through years of rigorous debate and consultation, Europe’s green framework has provided much-needed clarity for businesses and financial institutions. The EU’s abrupt shift on sustainability regulation reflects political pressures and short-term anxieties more than sound economic or scientific reasoning. Some argue that loosening green rules will help Europe stay competitive. But the evidence suggests the opposite. European companies disclosing through CDP have identified €3.47 trillion in climate-related business opportunities—compared to a cost of just €620 billion to realize them. That’s a nearly six-fold return. In short, sustainability isn’t a drag on the economy—it’s a catalyst for growth. Companies that embrace green practices aren’t just future-proofing their operations; they are seizing the economic high ground. The EU should be championing these leaders, not changing the rules to reward inaction. The Data is Working—Why Abandon It? Critics often claim that mandatory disclosure is a burden. But in reality, it is working—and driving real change. 80% of companies listed on European stock markets are already voluntarily disclosing environmental data through CDP. These businesses understand that transparency builds resilience. Between 2022 and 2023, companies in Europe reduced emissions by 3% while growing revenue by the same amount. This is not theory. It is proof that sustainability and economic performance are not mutually exclusive—they are increasingly intertwined. Moreover, rolling back sector-specific reporting standards, as proposed in the Omnibus package, would deprive markets of essential data. Without standardized, sector-level metrics, investors cannot properly assess risk, and companies cannot benchmark or plan effectively. Even SMEs—often presumed too small to comply—are already stepping up, with over 12,500 reporting through CDP’s SME questionnaire. Staying the Course Is the Only Responsible Choice Europe’s green leadership has always been both a moral and economic imperative. But that leadership only holds if the EU stays the course. If it too begins to unravel its environmental commitments, Europe risks joining a growing list of economies retreating from the future instead of preparing for it. With the U.S. stepping back, the EU has a chance to step forward—and become the undisputed global standard-bearer for sustainable growth. Of course, rules can and should be improved for clarity and usability. But simplification should reinforce, not erode, environmental standards. The solution is to work with businesses—especially SMEs—to ease compliance and improve access to capital and support systems. What we cannot afford is to throw out the framework that is already delivering results. A Time for Clarity, Not Compromise The EU stands at a defining moment. It can yield to short-term pressures and step back from its sustainability commitments—or it can lead with purpose and hold the line. There is no ambiguity in the science, and increasingly little in the economics. Sustainability is not an optional add-on. It is the foundation of a resilient, modern, and competitive European economy. The world is watching. Europe has already shown that it can lead. Now it must show that it can endure.

However, the Commission insists these changes won’t alter the EU’s decarbonization goals or broader ambitions around the net zero transition and clean industrial strategy. Ahead of the EU’s Omnibus package, over 200 financial sector organizations , including 162 asset owners and asset managers, urged policymakers not to dilute the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). While supporting simplification, they warned that weakening key elements of the CSRD risks undermining the high-quality, comparable data essential for informed investment decisions. The Dutch Financial Markets Authority (AFM) echoed this in March 2025, cautioning that scaling back reporting requirements for reporting or assurance could erode trust in the data. These worries are not unfounded. FTSE Russell’s 2024 survey reinforced that 90% of global asset owners view sustainability data as critical to decision-making, but over half cited ongoing issues with data consistency and comparability. The EU’s Omnibus Shift: Pausing, Streamlining, Simplifying Introduced in February 2025, the Omnibus I package includes two proposals that recalibrate Europe’s sustainability reporting scope and timeline. For sustainability teams, it presents both relief and uncertainty. The first, “ Stop the Clock Proposal, ” pauses the expansion of the CSRD’s scope beyond current Wave 1 companies, which are large, listed EU firms and public interest entities already subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive. This proposal has been formally adopted by both the European Council and the European Parliament, effectively formalizing the delay for companies beyond Wave 1. On April 14th, the final text was published in the Official Journal of the European Union and member states have until the end of 2025 to transpose it into national law. The second, “ Substantive Proposal, ” would simplify sustainability reporting by reducing complexity, prioritizing quantitative data, and raising the threshold for in-scope companies. According to the proposed thresholds, only companies with more than 1,000 employees would be required to report. These changes, while still under negotiation, would significantly reduce the number of companies in scope for mandatory reporting. Meanwhile, the European Commission has asked EFRAG to deliver a simplified and streamlined version of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) by late October 2025. EFRAG has already launched a public consultation seeking feedback on materiality assessments, narrative disclosures, and unclear or overlapping requirements. Stakeholders have until May 6, 2025, to respond. Riding the First Wave of CSRD Reporting and Raising the Bar on Governance Leading businesses are increasingly embedding robust governance practices, data controls, and accountability into the way they manage and report sustainability-related performance. According to Workiva’s 2025 Executive Benchmark on Integrated Reporting , 97% of corporate executives affirm that having a strong sustainability program will become a competitive advantage within two years, while 96% of investors agree it strengthens financial performance. As the first wave of CSRD-compliant reports emerges across Europe, Workiva’s analysis of 50 Wave 1 companies reveals significant advancements in sustainability governance, decision-useful data and standardized disclosures. GOV-1: Strengthening Governance Structures for Sustainability Workiva’s research shows that most Wave 1 companies have embedded sustainability governance into both executive and board-level oversight. In particular, 92% link sustainability performance targets to management incentives, signaling that sustainability issues are no longer siloed but integrated into business strategy. GOV-1 disclosures also show that audit committees are increasingly responsible for overseeing materiality assessments and related sustainability disclosures. This marks a strategic shift in how companies manage environmental, social, and governance risks, moving from compliance to boardroom accountability. GOV-5: Building Controls for Credibility GOV-5 disclosures reveal that over 80% of companies have introduced internal processes to mitigate risks related to errors and misstatements in sustainability data. These measures are crucial for enhancing the credibility of sustainability reporting and for enabling informed, data-driven decision-making. As external assurance and scrutiny grow, these early investments in control frameworks are positioning companies to lead on both transparency and trust. Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities (IRO) Reporting: Materiality in Motion Workiva’s analysis revealed significant variation in how companies identify and report material sustainability-related IROs. Some companies reported just a dozen, while others listed close to 100 IROs. Some offer a clear and consolidated view of all IROs, while others disperse IROs across different sections of the report and link them more closely to reporting on performance metrics. While practices differ, the trend signals a major evolution: IRO reporting helps companies define what sustainability really means for their business. As the market matures, sector-level convergence and more consistent reporting practices are expected to emerge. Navigating the Omnibus Changes: Key Decisions for EU and Non-EU Companies While immediate reporting requirements for those already in scope remain unchanged, companies should proactively prepare by considering potential regulatory scenarios, alongside requirements and expectations from their key stakeholders, as well as peer and competitor good practices. Wave 1 EU large listed companies well above the proposed new threshold ( entities with more than 1,000 employees and parent entities with more than 1,000 on a consolidated basis ): Expect unchanged reporting obligations for FY2025. However, do monitor and anticipate the simplified ESRS to be adopted by the delegated act and mandated for future reporting periods. Wave 1 EU listed companies near or below the proposed threshold : Maintain consistency in reporting through FY2025. Closely monitor EU legislative developments as new thresholds become finalized. If ultimately exempted after FY2026, companies can consider adjusting reporting strategies accordingly. NEW Wave 2 EU large private companies well above the proposed new threshold : Use the additional preparation time wisely before your first CSRD-compliant report (expected for FY2027). Your first fully ESRS-aligned report will likely require limited assurance and possibly also digital tagging of non-financial information. If FY2025 reporting under the original CSRD mandate would have caused any challenges, then use this time proactively to refine governance, double materiality, and build assurance-readiness. All other EU companies ( e.g., listed SMEs or private companies well below threshold ): Evaluate whether your current financial and sustainability disclosures sufficiently align with evolving expectations from customers, lenders, investors, and other business partners. Consider alignment with a simplified voluntary reporting standard to be adopted by the Commission, based on the voluntary standards for SMEs (VSME) developed by EFRAG . Non-EU companies with operations globally : Now is the time to conduct detailed, entity-level jurisdictional mapping. Subsidiaries or legal entities operating within the EU could be caught under local implementation. Beyond Europe, over 30 jurisdictions worldwide are at various stages of adopting or aligning with the ISSB Standards. Taking a proactive, globally coordinated approach to (double) materiality assessment, sustainability governance and data readiness will ensure you stay ahead of both regulatory expectations and stakeholder or market demands. In short, the biggest risk may be indecision and inaction – a pause without purpose. Those who invest in sustainability now, guided by materiality and powered by trusted data, will be best positioned when momentum inevitably picks up. By leveraging powerful tools, having a disciplined focus on materiality, companies can confidently manage their sustainability performance, even amidst regulatory flux and market uncertainty.

The development of the list in 2022 formed part of an anti-ESG movement in Republican states, which has gained further momentum since the election of President Trump, with Texas consistently at the forefront. Texas is the largest net energy supplier in the U.S., providing nearly a quarter of the country’s domestically produced energy, and accounting for over 40% of the nation’s crude oil proved reserves and production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Under Texas law, the Comptroller is required to maintain and update a “list of financial companies that boy energy companies,” with the law giving companies given 90 days to “cease boycotting energy companies in order to avoid qualifying for divestment by state governmental entities.” BlackRock was one of the investment companies first included on the list when it was launched by the Comptroller’s office in 2022. While Hegar welcomed changes made by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list and noted that “it took the company longer than others in the financial sector to make the shift,” each of the other investment companies included on the initial 2022 list remain on the updated list, expect for Credit Suisse, which has been acquired by UBS – which is also on the updated list. In a statement announcing the removal of BlackRock from the list, Hegar said: “This is a meaningful victory and validates the leadership Texas has shown on this issue, which has seen a monumental shift in the way companies, governments and individual Americans view the energy sector.” The Comptroller’s office listed a series of moves by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list, including the investment manager’s decision to exit the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative and to reduce its participation in Climate Action 100+, as well as reducing the number of fund offerings that prohibit investment in oil and gas. Hegar added that BlackRock “shifted away from blanket policies that ignore the critical need for fossil fuel-based energy generation now and long into the future.” 15 companies remain on the Comptroller’s list, including AMP, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Danske Bank, HSBC, Impax Asset Management, Jupiter Fund Management, NatWest, Nordea Bank, Rathbones, Schroders, Societe Generale, Svenska Handelsbanken, Swedbank and UBS, in addition to hundreds of individual funds. In a statement provided to ESG Today, a BlackRock spokesperson said: “We appreciate the Comptroller’s resolution of this matter. BlackRock is proud to help millions of Texans retire with dignity and, on behalf of clients, invests over $400 billion in corporations, local governments, energy infrastructure and other private assets throughout the state. These investments support the continued growth of the Texas economy.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The new GSI strategy was initially unveiled in December 2023 at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai, targeting $2.5 billion in total capital commitments. The strategy is aimed at accelerating and attracting institutional capital at scale by offering return enhancement to encourage private equity investments in high growth climate opportunities across the Global South. In September 2024, TPG announced that it had raised $1.25 billion in initial capital commitments for its new Global South Initiative (GSI) strategy, including a $500 million commitment from UAE-backed climate investment platform ALTÉRRA, as well as from its TPG Rise Climate II fund. TPG has said that the GSI strategy has also received commitments from institutional investors across Asia and North America. TPG announced its first deal from the strategy in March of this year, where it acquired Siemens Gamesa’s onshore wind turbine generator manufacturing business in Sri Lanka and India. Rise Climate II, launched in 2023, has previously raised around $5.5 billion in its own commitments – more than halfway to its hard-cap of $10 billion. TPG established its Rise fund franchise back in 2016 to target investment opportunities that deliver both a positive social impact and strong financial returns. TPG said: “IFC’s deep capital allocation experience in emerging markets, alongside Altérra’s anchor catalytic capital commitment to the GSI strategy, will help to channel private equity capital to innovative and cost-competitive climate solutions, including those that are meeting demand for abundant, reliable, and clean energy, more sustainable materials and molecules, and adaptation technologies.” Emanuela Hawker Related Posts Environment / Trump Administration Cancels $3.7 Billion Awards for Clean Energy Projects Investors / BlackRock Removed from Texas Boycott List After Leaving Climate Groups Private Equity & Venture Capital / Energize Capital Raises $430 Million for Climate Solutions Venture Fund ‹ STOXX, ICE Launch New Suite of Paris Agreement-Aligned Fixed Income Climate Indices › Energize Capital Raises $430 Million for Climate Solutions Venture Fund ESG Today Newsletter – Subscribe Subscribe to the ESG Today Newsletter Join our mailing list for the latest breaking ESG investment news!

According to STOXX and ICE, the new indices are being launched amidst increasing demand by investors for index based investing, and for climate-focused fixed income solutions. The new benchmarks include investment grade indices in currencies including U.S. dollars, euros, and sterling, among others, as well as high-yield bond indices in dollars and euros. Axel Lomholt, General Manager at STOXX, said: “Working with ICE Data Indices enables us to accelerate the delivery of fixed income benchmarks tailored to market demand. This collaboration brings together two leading financial companies and skill sets to launch and operate a suite of indices that addresses the growing demand for sustainable investment products in the bond market.” The new indices include products aimed at complying with and exceeding the requirements of the EU’s Paris-aligned Benchmarks (PAB) and Climate Transition Benchmarks (CTB).  Indices that are labeled as PABs must meet criteria for asset selection that results in the index aligning with the long-term climate goals of the Paris Agreement. Criteria include a minimum reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity of at least 50% compared to the market index, with annual GHG emissions intensity reductions of at least 7%, among others. CTB criteria also include 7% annual decarbonization, and a 30% minimum reduction in GHG emissions intensity relative to the market index. The methodology underlying the indices’ construction includes overweighting companies that have GHG reduction targets under the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and target a minimum ‘green-to-brown’ revenue ratio, while utilizing optimization to reduce the turnover and to track the performance of parent indices. The indices also include screens to exclude companies based on global norms, product involvement, controversies and activities that hinder certain UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). According to the companies, under the new collaboration, ICE will be responsible for pricing, reference data and index calculation services for the new indices, while STOXX, which developed the indices, will provide proprietary data and oversee the administration of the indices. Chris Edmonds, President of ICE Fixed Income and Data Services, said: “By combining STOXX’s experience in sustainability data and methodologies with our leading fixed income pricing, reference data and index calculation solutions, together we are creating powerful new benchmark products combining the expertise of two globally recognized and respected providers of data to fixed income markets.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The company said that it has hired sustainability solutions veteran Julien Picaud as Head of Product Management to lead the new initiative According to Schneider Electric, the new initiative is focused on Agentic AI, an emerging artificial intelligence technology designed to work independently or collaboratively with clients and consultants to anticipate needs and adapt to complex environments in real time, enabling significant advances in sustainability automation and simplification. The company added that investments in the new ecosystem will “reimagine” the functionality of Schneider Electric’s existing software, while introducing new features from the recently acquired climate services and solutions provider EcoAct . Specific anticipated features highlighted by Schneider Electric for the new ecosystem included decarbonization strategy, scenario analysis, benchmarking, emissions management, reporting and compliance, climate risk, value chain engagement, energy management, resource efficiency, and data integration, automation & visualization. Steve Wilhite, President of Schneider Electric’s Sustainability Business division, said: “Our vision is collaborative intelligence – agentic AI that works alongside human experts as a true digital teammate. This technology allows us to create a force multiplier effect where complex data analysis and tasks are automated, freeing our clients to focus on the strategic initiatives and innovations that lead to greater impact – a fundamental shift in how organizations can accelerate on their energy and decarbonization journeys.” Picaud joins Schneider Electric from sustainability data management solutions provider Sweep, where he served as Global Director of Product Marketing. Prior to joining Sweep, he served as Global Senior Director of Marketing and Product Marketing at ESG and sustainability software provider Enablon. Commenting on the new initiative, Dan Whitsell, CTO and Head of Software Engineering for Schneider’s Sustainability Business division, said: “Recognizing the energy intensity of AI, we are committed to developing and deploying this investment with a focus on computational efficiency and responsible resource usage. By integrating the principles of frugal AI, we are designing systems that deliver maximum intelligence with minimal resource consumption. This means leveraging leaner models, efficient algorithms, and optimized infrastructure to reduce energy use, emissions, and costs without sacrificing performance.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels. Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels. Although SAF usage needs to vastly increase, the growing cost to airlines is proving to be an obstacle, according to the IATA. Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said: “While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to two million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.” Both the EU and UK’s SAF-focused mandates went live on 1 January. In Europe, this resulted in the cost of SAFs doubling, due to the associated compliance fees implemented by SAF producers and suppliers. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF purchases required to meet European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion, with compliance costs estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices, according to the IATA. Walsh continued: “This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.” The IATA has urged governments to create more effective policies that support clean energy production – like SAFs – while decreasing support for fossil fuels, while also ensuring the success of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) by making Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. CORSIA was launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016 to address carbon emissions from international flights. To support the global development of SAF, the IATA previously launched a SAF registry , which is managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO). It introduced a more transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in line with existing regulations, such as the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). In addition, the IATA’s SAF Matchmaker aims to facilitate SAF procurement by aligning airline SAF requests with suppliers.

According to Danske Bank, the initiative reflects “the evolving landscape of sustainable finance,” with the bank having followed a traditional approach until now, primarily focused on allocating funds to specific projects or activities through use-of-proceeds financing or sustainability-linked loan facilities. Danske Bank Head of Large Corporates & Institutions, Joachim Alpen, said that the new approach is better aligned with its clients’ needs, with many large companies looking to transition to net zero or to scale their low-carbon solutions to address long-term risks and opportunities, but facing risks of losing competitiveness in the short term. Alpen said: “As a bank firmly dedicated to serving large organisations in the Nordics, it is crucial that we utilise the power of finance to facilitate climate transition. When our customers commit themselves to credible, long-term transitions, we commit to support them in managing the short-term challenges.” Under the new approach, Danske Bank said that it will move from solely sustainability-labelled transactions, such as green bonds and loans, to also financing the transition for companies in sectors such as such as power and heat, steel, cement, and transportation, based on comprehensive company-level assessments of entire transition plans. Transition plan assessments will be conducted using a proprietary transition risk assessment methodology, which scores companies as either transitioned, transitioning, start of transition or lagging transition, based on factors including the net zero alignment of the company, and assessed execution risk. The bank said that as part of the new approach, it will also look to finance companies in transition-enabling value chains, including areas such as renewable energy technologies, battery technologies, energy transmission and storage, and low-carbon transport. Danske Bank added that it is maintaining its targets for financed emissions reduction , and that the new approach does not change its position on fossil fuels. Samu Slotte, Head of Sustainable Finance at Danske Bank, said: “In the short term, our new and broader approach to transition finance may increase carbon emissions associated with our financing activities. In the longer term, we consider our new approach a significant step forward in our ability as a financial institution to support the climate transition of our customers and society.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

According to the company, the offering is the first-ever SLB linked to a net zero target across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions. Notably, while the volume of sustainability-linked bond offerings have declined significantly over the past several quarters on investor concerns over the credibility and robustness of the bonds’ linked sustainability targets, Snam reported strong demand for its net zero-linked offering, with the transaction 5x oversubscribed at an order book of approximately $10 billion. The offering of the new bonds follows the publication by Snam in April of its Sustainable Finance Framework. Under the framework, the cost of servicing the debt of the bonds is linked to a series of emissions reduction targets, including reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25% by the end of 2027, 50% by the end of 2030, and 90% by the end of 2050, and reducing Scope 3 emissions by 35% by the end of 2032 and by 90% by the end of 2050. Snam said that the targets align with net zero across all scopes by 2050, with up to 10% of emissions covered through offsets. The offering was structured in three tranches, including $750 million maturing in 2030, $750 million in 2035, and $500 million in 2055. The offering also marked Snam’s debut in the U.S. capital markets, and increased the share of the company’s sustainable finance to 86% of total committed funding. Snam CEO Agostino Scornajenchi said: “As Snam consolidates its position as a national and pan-European infrastructural player, strengthening our presence in global capital markets becomes essential to support our long-term growth ambitions. The strong interest shown by US fixed-income investors, together with the broad US investor base in our shareholding, reaffirms the high confidence in Snam’s sustainable strategy, financial soundness and our long-term industrial vision.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

In all, the DOE said that 24 awards were cancelled. Of those, the department added that two thirds were signed between the 2024 election day and the Trump inauguration. Most of the projects focused on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and decarbonization initiatives. The cancelled awards included $500 million for a carbon capture project at a Heidelberg Materials cement production plant, $330 million for a clean hydrogen project by Exxon Mobil, and $375 million for a plastic recycling project by Eastman Chemical. The announcement forms part in a series of moves by the Trump administration to reverse the Biden administration’s efforts to scale funding for clean energy and decarbonization projects. The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was launched in 2021 by the DOE , aimed at supporting clean energy technology demonstration projects in areas including clean hydrogen, carbon capture, small modular reactors, and grid-scale energy storage, among others. The launch of the OCED followed the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , which earmarked over $20 billion in funding for clean energy demonstrations and research hubs, supporting the acceleration of the Biden administration’s goals to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035 and a net-zero-carbon economy by 2050. In a statement announcing the cancelations, however, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said that the “DOE found that these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Wright added: “While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment. Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.” Energy transition focused groups criticized the Trump administration’s announcement, with many noting that it would put the U.S. behind in the development of key decarbonization technologies. Conrad Schneider, U.S. Senior Director of Clean Air Task Force (CATF), said: “Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation. Canceling cutting-edge technology demonstrations, including support for carbon capture and storage projects, undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

According to the report, the Commission’s assessment of the National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs), the EU is currently on course to reduce net GHG emissions by around 54% by 2030, and that member states plans reflect an ambition to achieve a 41% renewable energy share, only slightly behind the EU’s 42.5% target. The report also noted that the EU has already achieved a GHG emissions reduction of 37% as of the end of 2023 on a 1990 basis, despite 68% economic growth over the same period, including an 8% reduction in GHG emissions in 2023 alone. The EU set its 55% emissions reduction target into law in 2021 , alongside its goal to reach climate neutrality by 2050, raising its ambition from its prior 40% by 2030 goal. The Commission subsequently launched its “Fit for 55” initiative , introducing a broad series of legislation aimed at supporting the interim climate goal, including expanding its Emissions Trading System, introducing a carbon import tax, and setting emissions reduction targets and initiatives for key carbon-intensive industries. EU member states are required to regularly submit NECPs, outlining how they intend to meet the 2030 climate and energy targets. Under the current round, draft NECPs were due to be submitted in June 2023, and in an assessment of the drafts issued in December 2023, the Commission called on member states to improve their plans, highlighting “a clear need for extra efforts.” Final NECPs were due in June 2024, and the Commission in its new assessment said that member states have “substantially improved final plans.” In addition to the topline findings, the report also found that sectors covered by the EU’s Effort Sharing Regulation, including domestic transport, buildings, agriculture, small industry and waste, which account for almost 60% of total domestic EU emissions, are on track to decrease emissions by 38% by 2030, slightly behind the regulation’s target of 40%, with the Commission noting that the updated NECPs placed more emphasis on policies for decarbonizing transport and buildings, relative to the draft plans. The report also found that the EU land sector is not on track to meet a target to remove an additional 42 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030, noting that “the land sector has stored less and less carbon from the atmosphere in recent years,” and is not expected to improve. Additionally, the report found that member states’ plans were behind target on energy efficiency, with NECPs reflecting an energy consumption reduction ambition of 8.1% by 2030, compared to the 11.7% EU goal. The Commission is expected to release a proposed 2040 emissions goal this year, and in February 2024, recommended a 90% reduction for the new target. Teresa Ribera, Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition “Europe is proving that reliable and predictable science-based targets and adequate regulation deliver. The updated National Energy and Climate Plans show that the green agenda is not just a target but a way to modernise our economies and to bet on industrial innovation and more opportunities for Europeans. Our task now is to deepen in our capacities and boost action with no delays. We can deliver 55% and we need to build the conditions to reach 90% by 2040.” Click here to access the Commission’s assessment of the NECPs.
