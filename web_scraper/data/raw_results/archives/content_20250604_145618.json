Environmental and social awareness are on the rise globally, but until recently have been nearly absent in the investment process of professional investors. We believe this is changing, and in a big way. Allocations into sustainable investing mandates have been growing significantly. Innovations in sustainable finance are proliferating. Capital flows into sustainable investments are booming. And investors are increasingly demanding sustainable business practices and transparency from issuers. We believe that these trends are just beginning. Here at ESG Today, we believe that ESG will be the most important investment theme of the next decade.  And we’ll be here to report on it in real time, finding companies that either hit or miss on ESG issues, discovering which investment managers are ahead or behind the curve, and helping our readers navigate the risks and opportunities of the new world of sustainable finance and investing. Whether you’re looking to avoid ESG risk in your investments, pursue an active sustainable investment strategy, or find an ESG-savvy investment manager, ESG Today will be your source of news, research, information and analysis.

In all, the DOE said that 24 awards were cancelled. Of those, the department added that two thirds were signed between the 2024 election day and the Trump inauguration. Most of the projects focused on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and decarbonization initiatives. The cancelled awards included $500 million for a carbon capture project at a Heidelberg Materials cement production plant, $330 million for a clean hydrogen project by Exxon Mobil, and $375 million for a plastic recycling project by Eastman Chemical. The announcement forms part in a series of moves by the Trump administration to reverse the Biden administration’s efforts to scale funding for clean energy and decarbonization projects. The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was launched in 2021 by the DOE , aimed at supporting clean energy technology demonstration projects in areas including clean hydrogen, carbon capture, small modular reactors, and grid-scale energy storage, among others. The launch of the OCED followed the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , which earmarked over $20 billion in funding for clean energy demonstrations and research hubs, supporting the acceleration of the Biden administration’s goals to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035 and a net-zero-carbon economy by 2050. In a statement announcing the cancelations, however, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said that the “DOE found that these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Wright added: “While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment. Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.” Energy transition focused groups criticized the Trump administration’s announcement, with many noting that it would put the U.S. behind in the development of key decarbonization technologies. Conrad Schneider, U.S. Senior Director of Clean Air Task Force (CATF), said: “Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation. Canceling cutting-edge technology demonstrations, including support for carbon capture and storage projects, undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.
