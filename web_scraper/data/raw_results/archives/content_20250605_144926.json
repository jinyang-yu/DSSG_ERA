Infosys launched its ESG Vision 2030 strategy in 2020 , and also announced at the time that it had achieved carbon neutrality, reaching a target initially set by the company in 2011. The company’s updated ambition includes a target to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 90% from a 2020 baseline by 2030, and Scope 3 emissions by 40%. The company has also pledged to remain carbon neutral through 2030, and to engage clients on climate action through its solutions. In addition to climate change, Infosys’ ESG Vision 2030 encompasses areas of focus including water and waste management, digital skilling and employability, nurturing workplace inclusivity, amplifying communities, employee wellness and workplace experience, along with corporate governance, data privacy and information management. Additional targets included in the company’s updated strategy include extending digital skills to empower at least 18 million people and enabling employment opportunities for at least 500,000 people, ensuring zero waste to landfill, creating a gender-diverse workforce with 45% women, and helping to create sustainable communities through Tech for Good initiatives, job creation and CSR efforts. The company reported that over 98% of its clients have engaged with its ESG offerings, as it seeks to embed sustainability into its technology and consulting services, including areas such as responsible AI and sustainable software engineering. Infosys CEO Salil Parekh said: “As we’ve made progress on our ESG aspirations, our vision for the future has grown bolder too. This is reflected in the updates that we have made to the Infosys ESG Vision 2030. What remains unchanged is our continued commitment to be a well-governed organization living its purpose to amplify human potential and create the next opportunity for people, businesses, and communities.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

TAE said that the new capital will support its efforts to deliver world’s first commercial fusion power. Fusion, the process of combining two atoms to form a single atom to release energy, has long been viewed as crucial to a clean energy future, given its potential to produce power from hydrogen, while generating no carbon emissions. Large-scale fusion energy generation has been elusive, however, given the need to create extremely high temperatures and pressure. Founded in 1998, California-based TAE claims that its fusion systems provide safe carbon-free, utility-scale power, with no risk of long-lived radioactive waste. This gives its systems the flexibility to be based in highly populated areas, remote locations or large-scale data centers. The company has developed a proprietary approach called advanced beam-driven Field-Reversed Configuration (FRC), which is built to integrate with existing grid infrastructure. As it is modular, it has a quick and scalable deployment with a smaller footprint than a traditional fusion system but similar power outputs. Google Research first collaborated with TAE Technologies in 2015, applying AI to drive improvements in plasma temperature and lifetime. To date, TAE has raised more than $1.3 billion in equity since its founding in the late 1990s. Michl Binderbauer, CEO of TAE Technologies, said: “TAE’s technology uses the soundest physics to deliver superior performance in a compact machine, with attractive economics and best-in-class maintainability. We are leading the charge to develop revolutionary fusion technology for full-scale commercial deployment.” Earlier this year, TAE announced that it had made a “ breakthrough ” that has fundamentally advanced the performance, practicality and reactor-readiness of its proprietary fusion technology. It achieved stable plasmas at over 70 million °C in a simplified fusion device – an achievement the company said was made possible in part through TAE’s decade-long collaboration with Google. Binderbauer continued: “We’re delighted to continue our relationship with Google, who have not only provided funding to TAE but collaborated closely in research and development over many years. With this latest fundraise, we look forward to accelerating our efforts to deliver commercial fusion power.” TAE still has the opportunity to raise additional capital as part of this funding round. TAE now aims to validate net energy capability in its Copernicus reactor.  The company said that it has also published a roadmap for its first prototype power plant, Da Vinci, which will be operational in the early 2030s, delivering TAE’s first commercial fusion power.

According to Amir Amel-Zadeh, Associate Professor of Accounting at Saïd Business School, the new course comes as companies face a series of new sustainability reporting compliance requirements, and are moving from a voluntary reporting environment to mandatory sustainability reporting systems. Amel-Zadeh said: “Finance leaders sit at the intersection of strategy, compliance, and value creation. Fluency in sustainability reporting and ESG data management is therefore key. This program equips finance professionals not only with the technical knowledge to meet evolving standards but also with the strategic insight to embed sustainability into the core of decision-making by translating ESG data into actionable insights.” According to Oxford, AICPA & CIMA, the new eight week program, designed for senior finance team members, consultants, auditors and risk managers, is aimed at enabling professionals to develop, implement and enhance sustainability reporting strategies within their organizations, and to master sustainability reporting frameworks and standards including the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) underlying the EU’s CSRD regulation. Key focus areas of the course include the integration of ESG data into decision-making processes, leveraging technology to create business value, fostering robust governance and control systems for sustainable growth, and identifying best practices in preparing for sustainability assurance. The program includes multimedia learning material, webinars, and optional weekly group sessions led by course tutors, with participants receiving a certificate jointly signed by Saïd Business School and AICPA & CIMA upon completion. Jeremy Osborn, Global Head of Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Matters for AICPA & CIMA, said: “Accounting and finance professionals who complete this program will have the necessary tools to lead their organizations in sustainability reporting, employ best practices in meeting compliance with evolving regulations, and will have a better ability to anticipate trends in this rapidly maturing area.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

According to the company, the new solution supports the double materiality reporting process by combining stakeholder engagement data capabilities with AI-powered benchmarking enabling compliance alignment with the CSRD’s European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) and the ISSB standards. Key features of the new solution include centralized stakeholder engagement, materiality data, and documentation, intelligent benchmarking to identify industry trends, assess impacts, risks, and opportunities, and guide strategic decision-making, and alignment with CSRD and IFRS standards, according to Socialsuite. Seth Forman, CEO of Socialsuite, said: “As organizations face increasing regulatory pressure, they need a solution that not only ensures compliance but also streamlines and enhances their materiality risk assessments. Our new platform combines cutting-edge AI with collaborative project management tools, helping companies reduce the time and cost of conducting a double materiality assessment by up to 80%.” ESG Today Writing Staff Related Posts ESG Reporting / Oxford, AICPA & CIMA Launch New Sustainability Reporting Course for Finance, Accounting Professionals ESG Tools, Services / TPG Acquires Energy Software and Data Analytics Platform Aurora ESG Reporting / SAP Launches New Sustainability Data Management Solutions ‹ Clean Energy Startup Radiant Raises $165 Million to Replace Diesel Generators with Portable Nuclear Reactors › OMV to Build One of Largest Green Hydrogen Plants in Europe ESG Today Newsletter – Subscribe Subscribe to the ESG Today Newsletter Join our mailing list for the latest breaking ESG investment news!

Announced at SAP’s annual customer event, Sapphire, several of the new tools will form part of the company’s recently released Business Data Cloud (BDC) solution, which is designed to unify data from SAP applications and third-party sources. SAP said that a new range of sustainability data products will be available as part of the BDC solution, including environment, health, and safety management product compliance data products, which will provide structured, validated, and governed information on air, water, and wastewater emissions. Additionally, SAP said that more sustainability data products will be integrated into BDC later in 2025, including data from its corporate and product carbon footprint calculation solution, SAP Sustainability Footprint Management, and that SAP Sustainability Control Tower (SCT) will be available on SAP BDC later this year as part of a limited customer release. Launched in 2021, SAP Sustainability Control Tower was designed as a central location for all sustainability data at enterprises, aimed at helping companies monitor and manage sustainability performance. SAP also announced a series of new capabilities for its business process transformation suite, SAP Signavio, including embedding sustainability metrics, such as the ability to track and analyze carbon emissions across business processes. The company said that the new capabilities will be generally available in Q4 2025. Sophia Mendelsohn, Chief Sustainability and Commercial Officer at SAP, said: “Organizations often don’t realize how much sustainability data is already at their fingertips, hidden in procurement logs, operational systems, and supplier records. We’ve seen a tendency to zero in on carbon metrics, while overlooking equally important areas like resource use or supplier practices. At SAP, we’re uniquely positioned to connect these dots thanks to the breadth and depth of our data foundation. This year at Sapphire, we’re introducing new tools that help companies uncover the data they didn’t know they had, so they can unify them in one system and act on it more effectively.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The EBA said that its new proposals align with the initiatives of the European Commission to simplify sustainability reporting, such as the Commission’s Omnibus package. The EBA said: “In line with the European Commission’s omnibus proposal to reduce reporting costs and simplify sustainability reporting, the EBA has designed a proportionate approach for ESG disclosures based on the institution’s type, size and complexity, with simplified disclosures for banks other than large, particularly for those that are small or non-listed.” The EBA added that it also aims to simplify ESG reporting for large banks ”by clarifying the existing requirements based on the experience gained.” The EBA’s new proposals follow the publication by the EU in 2024 of a Banking Package (CRR3), which included changes to reporting requirements for banks beginning in 2025, including extending the scope of ESG risks-related disclosures from only large institutions to all institutions, in areas such as environmental physical risks and transition risks. Additional new ESG-related reporting requirements under the banking package include separate disclosure of environmental physical and transition risks, and their social and governance risks, total exposure to fossil fuel sector entities, and disclosures on how institutions integrate the identified ESG risks in their business strategy and processes, and governance and risk management. Under the EBA’s new proposals, separate disclosure requirements will be introduced for institutions, with large institutions subject to the “full set of information,” other listed institutions and large subsidiaries subject to the “simplified set of information,” and small and non-complex institutions (SNCIs) subject to an “essential set of information.” Examples of the differences between the information sets include semi-annual reporting on “Climate Change transition risk: Credit quality of exposures by sector, emissions and residual maturity” for large institutions, compared with annual reporting for other listed institutions and large subsidiaries, and a separate “Transition and physical risk for SNCI” annual disclosure for SNCIs. Large bank reporting requirements also include disclosure of their green asset ratio (GAR), or the share of assets aligned with sustainable activities, with the EBA’s new proposals ensuring full alignment of the GAR with the EU’s Taxonomy regulation. The EBA is also proposing introducing the possibility of reducing the frequency of some disclosures for large banks based on materiality reasons. The EBA launched a public consultation on the new proposals, with submissions due by August 22, 2025. Click here to access the consultation paper.

    "content": "ECB Warns EU Against Removing 80% of Companies from Mandatory Sustainability Reporting - ESG Today ESG Investing, sustainable finance & business sustainability news ESG investing news, analysis, research and information Top Stories ESG News Companies Government Investors Regulators Sustainable Finance ESG Solutions ESG Tools, Services Companies Companies Investors Investors ESG Disclosure ESG Reporting Analysis Regulators Reports, Studies Newsfeed Resources Events About About us Our Team Advertise With Us ESG Reporting / Government / Regulators ECB Warns EU Against Removing 80% of Companies from Mandatory Sustainability Reporting Mark Segal May 12, 2025 The European Central Bank (ECB) released a new opinion on the European Commission’s proposals to simplify and reduce sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements for companies. While welcoming the goal of simplifying requirements for companies, the ECB warned that some of the Commission’s plans could significantly increase risks for investors, the economy and the EU’s sustainability goals. Among the key recommendations in the central bank’s opinion was a proposal to significantly limit the planned reduction in scope of the companies covered by the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), with the ECB recommending mandatory sustainability reporting requirements for companies with 500 or more employees. The ECB’s publication follows the release in late February of the Commission’s Omnibus I package , aimed at significantly reducing the sustainability reporting and regulatory burden on companies, with proposals for major changes to a series of regulations including the CSRD, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), as well as the Taxonomy Regulation, and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). The CSRD was initially planned as a major update to the EU’s Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), the previous EU sustainability reporting framework, significantly expanding the number of companies required to provide sustainability disclosures to over 50,000 from around 12,000. Based on new underlying European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), the CSRD also introduces more detailed reporting requirements on company impacts on the environment, human rights and social standards and sustainability-related risk. The omnibus proposals, however, would significantly change the scope and coverage of the CSRD. Key proposed changes to the CSRD in the package include a dramatic reduction in scope, moving the regulation to cover only companies with more than 1,000 employees and either revenue greater than €50 million net turnover, removing an estimated 80% of companies from the regulation’s sustainability reporting requirements. In addition to the move to remove most companies from the CSRD, the Commission also plans to revise the ESRS, with the aim of substantially reducing the number of data points required by the sustainability reporting standards. In the central bank’s opinion, while the ECB states that it “supports the Commission’s efforts to streamline and simplify sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements,” it notes that “the availability of harmonised, standardised and reliable sustainability information” is essential to help ensure the flow of capital to activities supporting the EU’s sustainability goals, and to allow “market participants to understand and price sustainability-related financial risks,” while preventing “investment decisions being taken on the basis of incomplete information.” For its own role, the ECB noted that the availability of high-quality sustainability-related information is required for its roles in ensuring financial stability and managing monetary policy, stating that “physical and transition risks related to the climate and nature crises have profound implications for both price and financial stability through their impacts on the structure and cyclical dynamics of the economy and the financial system.” The ECB opinion takes issue with the Omnibus’s proposed reduction in scope, removing 80% of companies from coverage under the CSRD, stating that “this amendment could significantly limit stakeholders’ access to important information,” and warning of “unwanted outcomes,” including reducing the overall availability of sustainability information, including information on GHG emissions – noting that some significant emitters, including fossil fuel companies, will fall outside the scope of reporting. The ECB also warned that some companies currently providing sustainability information under the NFRD system will no longer be covered under the CSRD, as well as many credit institutions, with the ECB stating that “it is worth noting that ESG risks are not necessarily proportionate to an institution’s size.” In its opinion, the ECB suggests changes to the Omnibus proposal, recommending that instead of cutting off companies smaller than 1,000 employees from the scope of the CSRD, companies with 500-1,000 employees also be subject to mandatory sustainability reporting requirements, but applying “dedicated simplified sustainability reporting standards that are proportionate and relevant to the capacities and the characteristics of such undertakings and to the scale and complexity of their activities.” The ECB also notes that the Omnibus proposal to increase the scope of third-country companies covered by the CSRD would generate data gaps between EU and non-EU companies and create a competitive disadvantage for EU companies, and recommends that this proposal be eliminated. While welcoming the EU’s proposal to establish voluntary sustainability reporting standards for smaller companies not under the scope of the CSRD, the ECB also warns of potential dangers, such as self-selection, with only companies performing well choosing to report, and greenwashing risk from companies selectively choosing which sustainability aspects to report. The ECB proposes suggestions for the initiative to reduce the ESRS data points, noting that it its important to “retain data points that are relevant from the prudential and monetary policy perspectives.” Specifically, the ECB recommends retaining most climate change data points (ESRS E1), along with important biodiversity and ecosystems data points (ESRS E4), as these are particularly important essential for assessing and managing physical and transition risks for companies and financial institutions. Among the changes introduced by the Commission with its Omnibus proposal was an announcement that it will not introduce planned sector-specific sustainability reporting standards under the CSRD. The ECB, however, notes the importance of sector-specific information, such as for allowing financial institutions to assess and compare companies in the same sector on transition preparation. In its opinion, the ECB recommends that in the absence of sector-specific standards, the Commission should “consider adopting sector-specific guidelines in order to foster a common approach to implementing the ESRS within individual sectors. “ Click here to access the ECB opinion.

The NGFS was established in 2017, with the purpose of helping to strengthen the global response required to meet the goals of the Paris agreement and to enhance the role of the financial system to manage risks and to mobilize capital for green and low-carbon investments in the broader context of environmentally sustainable development. The organization provides science-based insights aimed at helping financial systems to navigate climate and nature-related risks. The NGFS’s key tools include its long-term climate scenarios – reflecting possible future climate policies, and assessing physical risks, including heat, drought and floods, and short and long-term risks stemming from the transition to a greener economy such as increasing carbon prices – which are used by many central banks worldwide in climate stress tests for banking and financial systems. According to the NGFS, the new short-term scenarios focus on a five- year time horizon, and offer detailed sector analysis and extensive coverage of financial risk and macroeconomic variables, exploring the interaction of factors including climate policies, extreme weather, economic trends and sectoral shifts. Among the key feature of the new scenarios highlighted by the NGFS include the accounting of compound physical climate risks, exploring how a sequence of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, wildfires, and storms could impact economies, including supply chain breakdowns. The scenarios also integrate climate policy, extreme weather events, economic trends and sectoral dynamics to provide scenarios that reflect the interaction of climate risks and business cycles, the organization added. In a presentation announcing the launch of the scenarios, the NGFS said: “With a focus on the next five years, the scenarios are particularly useful for financial sector applications, such as stress testing, risk assessment, and guiding policy calibration.” The new release includes four sets of scenarios, including one focusing only on physical risk, two transition risk only scenarios, and one scenario combining physical and transition risks. “Disasters and Policy Stagnation,” the physical risk scenario explores the economic and financial consequences of extreme but plausible weather events. The transition only scenarios include “Highway to Paris” which envisions an orderly, technology-driven gradual transition, and “Sudden Wake-Up Call,” in which there is a sudden change in policy preferences and consumer and investor preferences towards green sectors. “Diverging Realities,” considering physical and transition risk, sees advanced economies pursuing a “Highway to Paris” aligned scenario, while other economies are hit by extreme weather events, creating supply chain disruptions and raising the cost of the low-carbon transition. In the presentation on the new scenarios, NGFS Chair Sabine Mauderer and Chair of the workstream on Scenario Design and Analysis Livio Stracca said: “Robust and actionable climate risk analysis is essential for the global economy to navigate the climate challenge. Financial actors and policymakers must gain a deeper understanding of climaterelated risks in order to prepare for them appropriately. The NGFS short-term scenarios are hence a vital instrument for conducting risk assessments and making informed decisions with greater confidence.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Synergies with existing industrial processes present new opportunities to implement carbon removal methods as a means of improving efficiency, productivity, and revenue, while meeting regulatory demands. RMI’s recent report, Seizing the Industrial Carbon Removal Opportunity, highlights the case for why industrial leaders should act now to develop and deploy carbon removal technologies within industrial value chains —and how doing so can deliver both environmental and economic returns. Reason 1: Commercial and climate imperatives to support carbon removal are converging Pressures on heavy industry to both reduce and remove emissions are intensifying due to evolving regulatory landscapes and shifting market demands. They will likely continue to increase over the coming decades. Developing and integrating carbon removal provides industrial companies with an additional and complementary set of tools for addressing these pressures. Initial piloting activities of carbon removal technologies, such as integrating carbon capture into desalination , pulp and paper, wastewater , and mining facilities, are showing that this does not necessarily need to cost industrial companies money. Proactive engagement with CDR offers tangible commercial opportunities, from improving efficiency, accessing nascent carbon markets, and generating green product premiums. It could also help mitigate future regulatory risks and potential carbon tax obligations. This isn’t just about environmental responsibility; it’s about smart commercial strategy in an uncertain world. Reason 2: Industries can leverage existing assets and synergies to have impact Incorporating carbon removal does not necessarily require radical overhauls or disruptive technologies. Our report highlights that many heavy industries possess underutilized assets and inherent synergies that can be leveraged for carbon removal and even further emissions reductions. For example, waste streams from agriculture and forestry, construction and demolition, desalination, mining, steel, or wastewater processing can be put to use for long-term carbon removal and storage. Physical infrastructure in those industries and others can be made more productive by integrating CDR activities. This requires innovation in processes, operations, and business models. But it does not necessarily require scientific and technological leaps. Smart innovation within existing operational frameworks, using existing assets, can enhance early adopters’ near-term performance and long-term growth and resilience. Reason 3: Investing now in carbon removal can future-proof your business Investing in carbon removal now is an investment in future-proofing operations against a changing world and business environment. Relevant key trends include greater national prioritization of industrial innovation and growth, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and growing markets for removing carbon from the air. Companies that proactively integrate carbon removal into their operations will be better informed on carbon removal technology and operationalization and better positioned to navigate these trends and maintain their relevance and competitiveness over the long haul. How industries can get engaged with carbon removal Here are the actionable steps heavy industries should consider: Assess the carbon removal opportunity for your business, evaluating existing relevant operations and assets. Collaborate with other stakeholders to form new relationships and build knowledge. Invest in research, development and demonstration, allocating resources to pilot projects and demonstrations. Update your commercial goals to integrate carbon removal insights and create separate targets for decarbonization and carbon removal. These steps will unlock opportunities to integrate carbon removal into existing industrial processes, drive greater efficiency, productivity, and help companies meet tightening regulatory requirements.

Now is the time to double down on climate action. In the long arc of history, progress rarely travels in a straight line. But in moments of crisis, retreat can carry profound consequences. Europe now finds itself at one of those moments. The European Union is showing signs of reversing course on environmental policy—just when it should be accelerating. The European Commission’s proposed Omnibus Simplification Package represents a significant weakening of green legislation, most notably a dramatic scaling back of the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Far from a necessary simplification, this move threatens to undo years of environmental leadership, undermine corporate transparency, and jeopardize long-term economic resilience. A Dangerous Step Backwards The CSRD, only recently enacted, is central to the EU’s broader sustainability strategy. It requires large and listed companies to report standardized data on environmental, social, and governance performance—creating a consistent and transparent foundation for investors, regulators, and the public. Yet under the Omnibus proposal, the scope of the CSRD would shrink drastically. New analysis from CDP reveals that of the 11,000 companies that reported environmental data through the full 2024 CDP questionnaire, 83% (9,181 companies) would have met the original CSRD requirements. Under the proposed changes, that figure drops to 5,465—a 40% reduction. Thousands of companies already demonstrating transparency and responsibility would be exempted from future obligations. This is not streamlining. It is backsliding. It strips investors of the environmental risk data they need to make informed decisions. It undercuts businesses that have invested heavily in disclosure and sustainability. And most alarmingly, it could threaten financial stability in the Eurozone—as European Central Bank supervisors have explicitly warned . Sustainability Is a Competitive Advantage In April, the Commission announced delays in applying parts of the CSRD and due diligence requirements. Paired with the proposal to remove around 80% of companies from the directive’s scope, these decisions risk dismantling the policy foundation that supports stable, sustainable finance markets across Europe. Built through years of rigorous debate and consultation, Europe’s green framework has provided much-needed clarity for businesses and financial institutions. The EU’s abrupt shift on sustainability regulation reflects political pressures and short-term anxieties more than sound economic or scientific reasoning. Some argue that loosening green rules will help Europe stay competitive. But the evidence suggests the opposite. European companies disclosing through CDP have identified €3.47 trillion in climate-related business opportunities—compared to a cost of just €620 billion to realize them. That’s a nearly six-fold return. In short, sustainability isn’t a drag on the economy—it’s a catalyst for growth. Companies that embrace green practices aren’t just future-proofing their operations; they are seizing the economic high ground. The EU should be championing these leaders, not changing the rules to reward inaction. The Data is Working—Why Abandon It? Critics often claim that mandatory disclosure is a burden. But in reality, it is working—and driving real change. 80% of companies listed on European stock markets are already voluntarily disclosing environmental data through CDP. These businesses understand that transparency builds resilience. Between 2022 and 2023, companies in Europe reduced emissions by 3% while growing revenue by the same amount. This is not theory. It is proof that sustainability and economic performance are not mutually exclusive—they are increasingly intertwined. Moreover, rolling back sector-specific reporting standards, as proposed in the Omnibus package, would deprive markets of essential data. Without standardized, sector-level metrics, investors cannot properly assess risk, and companies cannot benchmark or plan effectively. Even SMEs—often presumed too small to comply—are already stepping up, with over 12,500 reporting through CDP’s SME questionnaire. Staying the Course Is the Only Responsible Choice Europe’s green leadership has always been both a moral and economic imperative. But that leadership only holds if the EU stays the course. If it too begins to unravel its environmental commitments, Europe risks joining a growing list of economies retreating from the future instead of preparing for it. With the U.S. stepping back, the EU has a chance to step forward—and become the undisputed global standard-bearer for sustainable growth. Of course, rules can and should be improved for clarity and usability. But simplification should reinforce, not erode, environmental standards. The solution is to work with businesses—especially SMEs—to ease compliance and improve access to capital and support systems. What we cannot afford is to throw out the framework that is already delivering results. A Time for Clarity, Not Compromise The EU stands at a defining moment. It can yield to short-term pressures and step back from its sustainability commitments—or it can lead with purpose and hold the line. There is no ambiguity in the science, and increasingly little in the economics. Sustainability is not an optional add-on. It is the foundation of a resilient, modern, and competitive European economy. The world is watching. Europe has already shown that it can lead. Now it must show that it can endure.

However, the Commission insists these changes won’t alter the EU’s decarbonization goals or broader ambitions around the net zero transition and clean industrial strategy. Ahead of the EU’s Omnibus package, over 200 financial sector organizations , including 162 asset owners and asset managers, urged policymakers not to dilute the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). While supporting simplification, they warned that weakening key elements of the CSRD risks undermining the high-quality, comparable data essential for informed investment decisions. The Dutch Financial Markets Authority (AFM) echoed this in March 2025, cautioning that scaling back reporting requirements for reporting or assurance could erode trust in the data. These worries are not unfounded. FTSE Russell’s 2024 survey reinforced that 90% of global asset owners view sustainability data as critical to decision-making, but over half cited ongoing issues with data consistency and comparability. The EU’s Omnibus Shift: Pausing, Streamlining, Simplifying Introduced in February 2025, the Omnibus I package includes two proposals that recalibrate Europe’s sustainability reporting scope and timeline. For sustainability teams, it presents both relief and uncertainty. The first, “ Stop the Clock Proposal, ” pauses the expansion of the CSRD’s scope beyond current Wave 1 companies, which are large, listed EU firms and public interest entities already subject to the Non-Financial Reporting Directive. This proposal has been formally adopted by both the European Council and the European Parliament, effectively formalizing the delay for companies beyond Wave 1. On April 14th, the final text was published in the Official Journal of the European Union and member states have until the end of 2025 to transpose it into national law. The second, “ Substantive Proposal, ” would simplify sustainability reporting by reducing complexity, prioritizing quantitative data, and raising the threshold for in-scope companies. According to the proposed thresholds, only companies with more than 1,000 employees would be required to report. These changes, while still under negotiation, would significantly reduce the number of companies in scope for mandatory reporting. Meanwhile, the European Commission has asked EFRAG to deliver a simplified and streamlined version of the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) by late October 2025. EFRAG has already launched a public consultation seeking feedback on materiality assessments, narrative disclosures, and unclear or overlapping requirements. Stakeholders have until May 6, 2025, to respond. Riding the First Wave of CSRD Reporting and Raising the Bar on Governance Leading businesses are increasingly embedding robust governance practices, data controls, and accountability into the way they manage and report sustainability-related performance. According to Workiva’s 2025 Executive Benchmark on Integrated Reporting , 97% of corporate executives affirm that having a strong sustainability program will become a competitive advantage within two years, while 96% of investors agree it strengthens financial performance. As the first wave of CSRD-compliant reports emerges across Europe, Workiva’s analysis of 50 Wave 1 companies reveals significant advancements in sustainability governance, decision-useful data and standardized disclosures. GOV-1: Strengthening Governance Structures for Sustainability Workiva’s research shows that most Wave 1 companies have embedded sustainability governance into both executive and board-level oversight. In particular, 92% link sustainability performance targets to management incentives, signaling that sustainability issues are no longer siloed but integrated into business strategy. GOV-1 disclosures also show that audit committees are increasingly responsible for overseeing materiality assessments and related sustainability disclosures. This marks a strategic shift in how companies manage environmental, social, and governance risks, moving from compliance to boardroom accountability. GOV-5: Building Controls for Credibility GOV-5 disclosures reveal that over 80% of companies have introduced internal processes to mitigate risks related to errors and misstatements in sustainability data. These measures are crucial for enhancing the credibility of sustainability reporting and for enabling informed, data-driven decision-making. As external assurance and scrutiny grow, these early investments in control frameworks are positioning companies to lead on both transparency and trust. Impacts, Risks, and Opportunities (IRO) Reporting: Materiality in Motion Workiva’s analysis revealed significant variation in how companies identify and report material sustainability-related IROs. Some companies reported just a dozen, while others listed close to 100 IROs. Some offer a clear and consolidated view of all IROs, while others disperse IROs across different sections of the report and link them more closely to reporting on performance metrics. While practices differ, the trend signals a major evolution: IRO reporting helps companies define what sustainability really means for their business. As the market matures, sector-level convergence and more consistent reporting practices are expected to emerge. Navigating the Omnibus Changes: Key Decisions for EU and Non-EU Companies While immediate reporting requirements for those already in scope remain unchanged, companies should proactively prepare by considering potential regulatory scenarios, alongside requirements and expectations from their key stakeholders, as well as peer and competitor good practices. Wave 1 EU large listed companies well above the proposed new threshold ( entities with more than 1,000 employees and parent entities with more than 1,000 on a consolidated basis ): Expect unchanged reporting obligations for FY2025. However, do monitor and anticipate the simplified ESRS to be adopted by the delegated act and mandated for future reporting periods. Wave 1 EU listed companies near or below the proposed threshold : Maintain consistency in reporting through FY2025. Closely monitor EU legislative developments as new thresholds become finalized. If ultimately exempted after FY2026, companies can consider adjusting reporting strategies accordingly. NEW Wave 2 EU large private companies well above the proposed new threshold : Use the additional preparation time wisely before your first CSRD-compliant report (expected for FY2027). Your first fully ESRS-aligned report will likely require limited assurance and possibly also digital tagging of non-financial information. If FY2025 reporting under the original CSRD mandate would have caused any challenges, then use this time proactively to refine governance, double materiality, and build assurance-readiness. All other EU companies ( e.g., listed SMEs or private companies well below threshold ): Evaluate whether your current financial and sustainability disclosures sufficiently align with evolving expectations from customers, lenders, investors, and other business partners. Consider alignment with a simplified voluntary reporting standard to be adopted by the Commission, based on the voluntary standards for SMEs (VSME) developed by EFRAG . Non-EU companies with operations globally : Now is the time to conduct detailed, entity-level jurisdictional mapping. Subsidiaries or legal entities operating within the EU could be caught under local implementation. Beyond Europe, over 30 jurisdictions worldwide are at various stages of adopting or aligning with the ISSB Standards. Taking a proactive, globally coordinated approach to (double) materiality assessment, sustainability governance and data readiness will ensure you stay ahead of both regulatory expectations and stakeholder or market demands. In short, the biggest risk may be indecision and inaction – a pause without purpose. Those who invest in sustainability now, guided by materiality and powered by trusted data, will be best positioned when momentum inevitably picks up. By leveraging powerful tools, having a disciplined focus on materiality, companies can confidently manage their sustainability performance, even amidst regulatory flux and market uncertainty.

The survey found that despite the recent geopolitical upheavals, less than 3% of investors reported scaling back their ESG objectives, while 87% report that their ESG and sustainability objectives remain the same. Within the latter group, however, nearly half said that despite retaining their ESG objectives, they have become less vocal about their process and achievements. Investors in the Americas were much more likely to report scaling back their sustainability objectives, at 7%, compared to around 2% or EMEA investors, and less than 1% of APAC investors, according to the report. According to the survey, investors plans to stick with their ESG approaches broadly reflects their future expectations, with 85% reporting that they expect the pace of progress towards sustainability to remain the same (74%) or to even accelerate (11%) through 2030, although 23% said that they expect it to continue “with less publicity,” and only 16% expect it to slow down. The survey also found that approaches to sustainable investing are becoming more sophisticated and focused, with investors increasingly allocating to specific themes or regions to help concentrate their expertise on generating better outcomes. Overall, thematic investing has increased over the past few years, with half of investors now citing using it as a sustainable investing approach, behind only negative screening at 62%, and energy transition investments at 52%. In the report, BNP Paribas said: “With growing investment opportunities in ranging from energy to biodiversity, to adaptation activities, to transition, we can expect investors to continue to focus on thematics for the rest of this decade, and to reduce exposure to generalist ESG strategies.” The survey assessed investors’ top sustainability objectives for the short- and long-term. Over the next two years, 49% of investors reported plans to increase allocations to energy transition assets, and 49% said that they will use active ownership to advance their organization’s ESG goals, while 46% reported that they will invest in low-carbon assets and divest from high-carbon assets. Notably, less than a third of investors reported that they will integrate DEI into investment policies, down from 41% in a 2023 survey. Longer term, committing to net zero by a specific date was the most commonly cited sustainability objectives, reported by 40% of investors, followed by plans to measure portfolio alignment with Paris Agreement benchmarks at 34%, and to promote social issues by 33%. Well over half of investors – 58% – continue to report “ESG/sustainability data and research challenges” as the most significant barrier they face when allocating to ESG and sustainability investments. Additional challenges cited by investors include the conflict between short-term performance and long-term sustainability goals, cited by 56%, and greenwashing risks by investee companies or product providers at 54%. The report found that in order to manage their ESG data challenges, nearly half of investors (48%) anticipate allocating more budget to ESG data acquisition and analysis, while 38% plan to increase funding to reporting, impact measurement and disclosure, and 37% expect to hire specialized ESG talent. 54% of investors reported using and comparing multiple sources of sustainability data, while 48% said that they conduct their own research methodologies, such as creating benchmarks or in-house ESG scores. Investors also appear wary of relying on ESG ratings, with 70% agreeing that focusing on ESG ratings could lead companies to favor reputation management over real impact.

The development of the list in 2022 formed part of an anti-ESG movement in Republican states, which has gained further momentum since the election of President Trump, with Texas consistently at the forefront. Texas is the largest net energy supplier in the U.S., providing nearly a quarter of the country’s domestically produced energy, and accounting for over 40% of the nation’s crude oil proved reserves and production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Under Texas law, the Comptroller is required to maintain and update a “list of financial companies that boy energy companies,” with the law giving companies given 90 days to “cease boycotting energy companies in order to avoid qualifying for divestment by state governmental entities.” BlackRock was one of the investment companies first included on the list when it was launched by the Comptroller’s office in 2022. While Hegar welcomed changes made by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list and noted that “it took the company longer than others in the financial sector to make the shift,” each of the other investment companies included on the initial 2022 list remain on the updated list, expect for Credit Suisse, which has been acquired by UBS – which is also on the updated list. In a statement announcing the removal of BlackRock from the list, Hegar said: “This is a meaningful victory and validates the leadership Texas has shown on this issue, which has seen a monumental shift in the way companies, governments and individual Americans view the energy sector.” The Comptroller’s office listed a series of moves by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list, including the investment manager’s decision to exit the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative and to reduce its participation in Climate Action 100+, as well as reducing the number of fund offerings that prohibit investment in oil and gas. Hegar added that BlackRock “shifted away from blanket policies that ignore the critical need for fossil fuel-based energy generation now and long into the future.” 15 companies remain on the Comptroller’s list, including AMP, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Danske Bank, HSBC, Impax Asset Management, Jupiter Fund Management, NatWest, Nordea Bank, Rathbones, Schroders, Societe Generale, Svenska Handelsbanken, Swedbank and UBS, in addition to hundreds of individual funds. In a statement provided to ESG Today, a BlackRock spokesperson said: “We appreciate the Comptroller’s resolution of this matter. BlackRock is proud to help millions of Texans retire with dignity and, on behalf of clients, invests over $400 billion in corporations, local governments, energy infrastructure and other private assets throughout the state. These investments support the continued growth of the Texas economy.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The new GSI strategy was initially unveiled in December 2023 at the COP28 climate conference in Dubai, targeting $2.5 billion in total capital commitments. The strategy is aimed at accelerating and attracting institutional capital at scale by offering return enhancement to encourage private equity investments in high growth climate opportunities across the Global South. In September 2024, TPG announced that it had raised $1.25 billion in initial capital commitments for its new Global South Initiative (GSI) strategy, including a $500 million commitment from UAE-backed climate investment platform ALTÉRRA, as well as from its TPG Rise Climate II fund. TPG has said that the GSI strategy has also received commitments from institutional investors across Asia and North America. TPG announced its first deal from the strategy in March of this year, where it acquired Siemens Gamesa’s onshore wind turbine generator manufacturing business in Sri Lanka and India. Rise Climate II, launched in 2023, has previously raised around $5.5 billion in its own commitments – more than halfway to its hard-cap of $10 billion. TPG established its Rise fund franchise back in 2016 to target investment opportunities that deliver both a positive social impact and strong financial returns. TPG said: “IFC’s deep capital allocation experience in emerging markets, alongside Altérra’s anchor catalytic capital commitment to the GSI strategy, will help to channel private equity capital to innovative and cost-competitive climate solutions, including those that are meeting demand for abundant, reliable, and clean energy, more sustainable materials and molecules, and adaptation technologies.” Emanuela Hawker Related Posts Environment / Nippon Steel to Invest $6 Billion to Decarbonize Steelmaking Investors / T.

The company said that it has hired sustainability solutions veteran Julien Picaud as Head of Product Management to lead the new initiative According to Schneider Electric, the new initiative is focused on Agentic AI, an emerging artificial intelligence technology designed to work independently or collaboratively with clients and consultants to anticipate needs and adapt to complex environments in real time, enabling significant advances in sustainability automation and simplification. The company added that investments in the new ecosystem will “reimagine” the functionality of Schneider Electric’s existing software, while introducing new features from the recently acquired climate services and solutions provider EcoAct . Specific anticipated features highlighted by Schneider Electric for the new ecosystem included decarbonization strategy, scenario analysis, benchmarking, emissions management, reporting and compliance, climate risk, value chain engagement, energy management, resource efficiency, and data integration, automation & visualization. Steve Wilhite, President of Schneider Electric’s Sustainability Business division, said: “Our vision is collaborative intelligence – agentic AI that works alongside human experts as a true digital teammate. This technology allows us to create a force multiplier effect where complex data analysis and tasks are automated, freeing our clients to focus on the strategic initiatives and innovations that lead to greater impact – a fundamental shift in how organizations can accelerate on their energy and decarbonization journeys.” Picaud joins Schneider Electric from sustainability data management solutions provider Sweep, where he served as Global Director of Product Marketing. Prior to joining Sweep, he served as Global Senior Director of Marketing and Product Marketing at ESG and sustainability software provider Enablon.

By integrating the principles of frugal AI, we are designing systems that deliver maximum intelligence with minimal resource consumption.

Blended finance brings together public or philanthropic capital and private funding through a common investment structure, enabling investors to invest in certain types of investments that have high perceived risk profiles, such as new climate mitigation-related technologies. The coalition – Scaling Capital for Sustainable Development (SCALED) – was first introduced as the Hamburg Sustainability Platform at last year’s Hamburg Sustainability conference. Since then, it has evolved into a formal partnership of financial institutions and governments including Allianz, AXA, Zurich Insurance Group, Canada, France and the UK, which is focused on growing sustainable blended finance-focused investment opportunities across EMDEs. At this year’s conference, which took place this week, the coalition has said it is preparing the launch of a service provider company that will be focused on investment standardization. Achim Steiner, Administrator at the UN Develop Program, said: “We are in a time of uncertainty with rising geopolitical divisions, where development pathways are under pressure because of aid cuts, trade tension, and the debt crisis. What we need now is more cooperation, not less. It is in opportunities like the Hamburg Sustainability Conference where we find those critical touch points to take on big ideas, rebuild trust, advance innovative solutions, and forge meaningful connections across communities around the world.” The new company is expected to commence operations by the end of this year. It will be tasked with developing and establishing standardized financial vehicles that both public and private investors can utilise. It will also play a key role in matchmaking, bridging persistent financing gaps across climate, infrastructure and development sectors. SCALED expects the initiative to unlock billions of dollars in private investment over the coming years. The announcement came as part of a wider series of developments at the conference, which convened around 1,600 global leaders across government, business and academia. The Asia-Pacific Blended Finance Community of Practice was also launched. Serving as a regional hub to coordinate and mobilise blended finance solutions for sustainable development, it is expected to enhance collaboration, knowledge exchange and deal origination.

According to Danske Bank, the initiative reflects “the evolving landscape of sustainable finance,” with the bank having followed a traditional approach until now, primarily focused on allocating funds to specific projects or activities through use-of-proceeds financing or sustainability-linked loan facilities. Danske Bank Head of Large Corporates & Institutions, Joachim Alpen, said that the new approach is better aligned with its clients’ needs, with many large companies looking to transition to net zero or to scale their low-carbon solutions to address long-term risks and opportunities, but facing risks of losing competitiveness in the short term. Alpen said: “As a bank firmly dedicated to serving large organisations in the Nordics, it is crucial that we utilise the power of finance to facilitate climate transition. When our customers commit themselves to credible, long-term transitions, we commit to support them in managing the short-term challenges.” Under the new approach, Danske Bank said that it will move from solely sustainability-labelled transactions, such as green bonds and loans, to also financing the transition for companies in sectors such as such as power and heat, steel, cement, and transportation, based on comprehensive company-level assessments of entire transition plans. Transition plan assessments will be conducted using a proprietary transition risk assessment methodology, which scores companies as either transitioned, transitioning, start of transition or lagging transition, based on factors including the net zero alignment of the company, and assessed execution risk. The bank said that as part of the new approach, it will also look to finance companies in transition-enabling value chains, including areas such as renewable energy technologies, battery technologies, energy transmission and storage, and low-carbon transport. Danske Bank added that it is maintaining its targets for financed emissions reduction , and that the new approach does not change its position on fossil fuels. Samu Slotte, Head of Sustainable Finance at Danske Bank, said: “In the short term, our new and broader approach to transition finance may increase carbon emissions associated with our financing activities. In the longer term, we consider our new approach a significant step forward in our ability as a financial institution to support the climate transition of our customers and society.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

According to the company, the offering is the first-ever SLB linked to a net zero target across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions. Notably, while the volume of sustainability-linked bond offerings have declined significantly over the past several quarters on investor concerns over the credibility and robustness of the bonds’ linked sustainability targets, Snam reported strong demand for its net zero-linked offering, with the transaction 5x oversubscribed at an order book of approximately $10 billion. The offering of the new bonds follows the publication by Snam in April of its Sustainable Finance Framework. Under the framework, the cost of servicing the debt of the bonds is linked to a series of emissions reduction targets, including reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 25% by the end of 2027, 50% by the end of 2030, and 90% by the end of 2050, and reducing Scope 3 emissions by 35% by the end of 2032 and by 90% by the end of 2050. Snam said that the targets align with net zero across all scopes by 2050, with up to 10% of emissions covered through offsets. The offering was structured in three tranches, including $750 million maturing in 2030, $750 million in 2035, and $500 million in 2055. The offering also marked Snam’s debut in the U.S. capital markets, and increased the share of the company’s sustainable finance to 86% of total committed funding. Snam CEO Agostino Scornajenchi said: “As Snam consolidates its position as a national and pan-European infrastructural player, strengthening our presence in global capital markets becomes essential to support our long-term growth ambitions. The strong interest shown by US fixed-income investors, together with the broad US investor base in our shareholding, reaffirms the high confidence in Snam’s sustainable strategy, financial soundness and our long-term industrial vision.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

In all, the DOE said that 24 awards were cancelled. Of those, the department added that two thirds were signed between the 2024 election day and the Trump inauguration. Most of the projects focused on carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) and decarbonization initiatives. The cancelled awards included $500 million for a carbon capture project at a Heidelberg Materials cement production plant, $330 million for a clean hydrogen project by Exxon Mobil, and $375 million for a plastic recycling project by Eastman Chemical. The announcement forms part in a series of moves by the Trump administration to reverse the Biden administration’s efforts to scale funding for clean energy and decarbonization projects. The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations was launched in 2021 by the DOE , aimed at supporting clean energy technology demonstration projects in areas including clean hydrogen, carbon capture, small modular reactors, and grid-scale energy storage, among others. The launch of the OCED followed the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law , which earmarked over $20 billion in funding for clean energy demonstrations and research hubs, supporting the acceleration of the Biden administration’s goals to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035 and a net-zero-carbon economy by 2050. In a statement announcing the cancelations, however, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said that the “DOE found that these projects failed to advance the energy needs of the American people, were not economically viable and would not generate a positive return on investment of taxpayer dollars.” Wright added: “While the previous administration failed to conduct a thorough financial review before signing away billions of taxpayer dollars, the Trump administration is doing our due diligence to ensure we are utilizing taxpayer dollars to strengthen our national security, bolster affordable, reliable energy sources and advance projects that generate the highest possible return on investment. Today, we are acting in the best interest of the American people by cancelling these 24 awards.” Energy transition focused groups criticized the Trump administration’s announcement, with many noting that it would put the U.S. behind in the development of key decarbonization technologies. Conrad Schneider, U.S. Senior Director of Clean Air Task Force (CATF), said: “Today’s action is bad for U.S. competitiveness in the global market and also directly contradictory to the administration’s stated goals of supporting energy production and environmental innovation. Canceling cutting-edge technology demonstrations, including support for carbon capture and storage projects, undercuts U.S. competitiveness at a time when there is a growing global market for cleaner industrial products and technologies.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

According to the report, the Commission’s assessment of the National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs), the EU is currently on course to reduce net GHG emissions by around 54% by 2030, and that member states plans reflect an ambition to achieve a 41% renewable energy share, only slightly behind the EU’s 42.5% target. The report also noted that the EU has already achieved a GHG emissions reduction of 37% as of the end of 2023 on a 1990 basis, despite 68% economic growth over the same period, including an 8% reduction in GHG emissions in 2023 alone. The EU set its 55% emissions reduction target into law in 2021 , alongside its goal to reach climate neutrality by 2050, raising its ambition from its prior 40% by 2030 goal. The Commission subsequently launched its “Fit for 55” initiative , introducing a broad series of legislation aimed at supporting the interim climate goal, including expanding its Emissions Trading System, introducing a carbon import tax, and setting emissions reduction targets and initiatives for key carbon-intensive industries. EU member states are required to regularly submit NECPs, outlining how they intend to meet the 2030 climate and energy targets. Under the current round, draft NECPs were due to be submitted in June 2023, and in an assessment of the drafts issued in December 2023, the Commission called on member states to improve their plans, highlighting “a clear need for extra efforts.” Final NECPs were due in June 2024, and the Commission in its new assessment said that member states have “substantially improved final plans.” In addition to the topline findings, the report also found that sectors covered by the EU’s Effort Sharing Regulation, including domestic transport, buildings, agriculture, small industry and waste, which account for almost 60% of total domestic EU emissions, are on track to decrease emissions by 38% by 2030, slightly behind the regulation’s target of 40%, with the Commission noting that the updated NECPs placed more emphasis on policies for decarbonizing transport and buildings, relative to the draft plans. The report also found that the EU land sector is not on track to meet a target to remove an additional 42 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030, noting that “the land sector has stored less and less carbon from the atmosphere in recent years,” and is not expected to improve. Additionally, the report found that member states’ plans were behind target on energy efficiency, with NECPs reflecting an energy consumption reduction ambition of 8.1% by 2030, compared to the 11.7% EU goal. The Commission is expected to release a proposed 2040 emissions goal this year, and in February 2024, recommended a 90% reduction for the new target. Teresa Ribera, Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition “Europe is proving that reliable and predictable science-based targets and adequate regulation deliver. The updated National Energy and Climate Plans show that the green agenda is not just a target but a way to modernise our economies and to bet on industrial innovation and more opportunities for Europeans. Our task now is to deepen in our capacities and boost action with no delays. We can deliver 55% and we need to build the conditions to reach 90% by 2040.” Click here to access the Commission’s assessment of the NECPs.

According to DuPont, the achievement has been made possible through the use of Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) and on-site solar energy. The company said that the announcement marks a key step towards its commitment to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050. DuPont has also set 2030 goals to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50%, Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services and end-of-life of sold products by 25%, and to source 60% of power from renewable sources. Alexa Dembek, Chief Technology and Sustainability Officer at DuPont, said: “At DuPont, we are guided by a core value of protecting the planet, aligning our sustainability goals to meet the expectations of our customers, value chain partners and the communities in which we operate. Converting our EU manufacturing sites to 100% renewable electricity is a significant step in our journey to further reduce our emissions, lower the carbon footprint of our products and put us on a clear path toward decarbonization in our operations by 2050.” DuPont currently operates 13 manufacturing sites across the EU, all of which are now powered by renewable electricity. These have included the installation of on-site solar panels and the purchase of bundled and unbundled RECs. The new milestone in the EU follows the company’s 2021 commitment to RE100, a global initiative led by the Climate Group in partnership with CDP, focused on bringing companies together via a pledge to power their operations entirely with renewable energy. DuPont’s 2024 sustainability report further details the company’s progress toward its 2030 goals. As of 2024, DuPont had reduced Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 58% from a 2019 baseline, exceeding its 2030 target and aligning with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C ambition. Scope 3 emissions were also down 39% from 2020 levels.

The new agreement, beginning in June 2027, will allow Constellation’s Clinton Clean Energy Center in DeWitt County, Illinois to be relicensed and to continue operating for another 20 years. The site entered commercial service in 1987, and was slated for premature closure in 2017 after years of financial losses, although the closure was postponed through mid-2027 by the state’s Future Energy Jobs Act, through support from a zero emission credit (ZEC) program. According to Constellation, the new agreement will essentially replace the ZEC program, and will also add 30 MW of capacity through plant uprates. The company added that it is also evaluating strategies to extend the plant’s existing early site permit or seek a new construction permit from the to pursue development of an advanced nuclear reactor or small modular reactor (SMR) at the site. The agreement follows a deal last year between Constellation and Microsoft enabling the restart of the Three Mile Island Unit 1 nuclear reactor in Pennsylvania. Constellation President and CEO Joe Dominguez said: “Last year, Constellation’s announced plan to restart the Crane Clean Energy Center became national news, but despite all of the interest and overwhelming support, a key question was missed: why did we let such a valuable plant close in the first place? We all know that the closure cost our community jobs, tax revenue, more pollution and higher prices. We are proud to partner with Meta because they asked that important question, and even better, they figured out that supporting the relicensing and expansion of existing plants is just as impactful as finding new sources of energy. Sometimes the most important part of our journey forward is to stop taking steps backwards.” The announcement is the latest in a series of moves by Meta to turn to nuclear power to address the need for a rapid increase in electricity production to accommodate the growth in AI-driven data center capacity and power consumption, while protecting its goals to reduce the emissions impact of its operations. Meta has set targets to reach net-zero emissions across its value chain by 2030, and to continue to match 100% of the electricity used in its data centers and offices with renewable energy. In the company’s 2024 Sustainability Report, Meta said that while it has maintained net zero in its operations since 2020, its 2030 net zero value chain goal will be significantly harder to achieve, adding that “the challenge of reaching our sustainability goals given the increased demand for energy and resources driven by AI is not unique to Meta.” In late 2024, the company announced the launch of a request for proposals (RFPs) for nuclear energy developers in the U.S. to provide new nuclear capacity, targeting the addition of between 1-to-4 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear generation, with delivery to begin in the early 2030s. In an update provided with the Constellation announcement, Meta said that it has received more than 50 qualified submissions to its RFP from utilities, developers and nuclear technology manufacturers, and that it has shortlisted projects across multiple states representing the most feasible opportunities., with priority given to sites where nuclear development can be advanced quickly with high degrees of certainty on execution and timeline. Earlier this year, Meta, alongside companies including its tech giant peers Amazon and Google signed a pledge to support the goal to triple global nuclear energy capacity by 2050. Urvi Parekh, Head of Global Energy at Meta, said: “Securing clean, reliable energy is necessary to continue advancing our AI ambitions. We are proud to help keep the Clinton plant operating for years to come and demonstrate that this plant is an important piece to strengthening American leadership in energy.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

All projects are at an advanced stage of development, forming part of Low Carbon’s 16 GW pipeline, which includes solar, onshore wind and battery projects. Olivier Jouny, Senior Vice President of Renewables at TotalEnergies, said: “We are delighted with the acquisition of these projects from Low Carbon. Located in the south of England, they benefit from favorable sunlight and complement our integrated electricity portfolio in the UK, which includes 1.1 GW of gross installed offshore wind, 1.3 GW of gross combined cycle gas turbine, and more than 600 MW of solar projects under development.” The acquired projects should be operational by 2028, producing more than 350 GWh of renewable electricity per year – the equivalent energy consumption of 100,000 UK households annually. This purchase follows a series of transactions made over the last few months by TotalEnergies, including the closing of three acquisitions in Europe, Africa and Canada. These deals form part of the energy firm’s efforts to boost clean energy capacity and align with its overall commitment to reach more than 100 TWh of net electricity production by 2030 and net zero across the business by 2050. Roy Bedlow, Founder and CEO of Low Carbon, said: “We are very pleased to have finalized this agreement with TotalEnergies, who are making an impressive commitment to building renewable infrastructure and sees Low Carbon deliver one of the largest ready-to-build portfolios of solar and battery projects in the UK market.” Low Carbon currently has more than 1 GW of renewable capacity in operation and construction across the UK and Europe that is supported through a mixture of corporate power purchase agreements and (PPAs) and contracts for difference (CfDs). Low Carbon will be starting construction on an additional 400 MW of solar and battery projects over the next 18 months.

According to the companies, Google plans to invest more than $4 million to fund the use of Arable’s technology on 20,000 acres, aimed at saving more than 500 million gallons (1.9 billion liters) over eight years. Founded in 2014, Arable enables data-driven decisions in agriculture and natural resource management to help improve agricultural sustainability and productivity. The company’s solutions integrate IoT technology, machine learning, and advanced modeling to convert in-field weather, crop, soil, and irrigation data into real-time insights. Arable’s crop intelligence platform enables farmers to make precise irrigation decisions by providing real-time data on factors including weather, soil moisture and crop health. The companies said that the projects are expected to have a significant positive impact on groundwater in some of the most at-risk river basins and aquifers in North and South Carolina, providing benefits including improved water availability and quality, farmer training on new technology, enhanced on-farm profitability, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Jim Ethington, CEO at Arable, said: “By combining reliable, real-time data with intuitive decision tools, we’re helping farmers do more with less-less water, less energy, and less risk. We’re excited to bring much needed technology to a region where the need is high and impact to farmers and ecosystems can be significant.” Google announced a water stewardship ambition in 2021, with a goal to become water positive by 2030, setting a commitment to replenish more water than it consumes, and to support water security and ecosystems in the communities in which the company operates. The company said that the collaboration with Arable will support its goal to replenish 120% of its freshwater consumption by 2030. Suzie Shin, Data Center Sustainability Programs Manager at Google, said: “Supporting responsible and sustainable water use in agriculture is essential for the long-term health of ecosystems and communities. With data center campuses in both North Carolina and South Carolina, we’re proud to build on our work with Arable to bring this solution to a region we have called home for nearly 20 years.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The new transaction follows an initial 40,000 carbon credit purchase agreement by the companies last year . Founded in 2013, Indigo Ag provides nature-based and digital technologies aimed at helping farmers improve profitability and environmental sustainability. The company launched its carbon program in 2019, helping farmers adopt regenerative agriculture practices including cover crops, diversified crop rotation, reduced tillage and improved nitrogen timing, that enrich soil while sequestering carbon dioxide. Under the program, farmers add the new practices with agronomic support from Indigo, while the company also calculates the carbon credits through the use of soil samples and on-farm data, validates the findings with a verifier, with results submitted to a carbon registry, for issuance of the credits, which can be sold to corporate buyers. The new transaction is sourced from Indigo’s fourth carbon crop, consisting of over half a million independently verified carbon credits issued through the Climate Action Reserve. To date, Indigo’s carbon program has generated over 900,000 tons of carbon removal across 28 states, and has prevented over 64 billion gallons of surface water runoff. Indigo Ag CEO Dean Banks said: “When Microsoft, recognized as the major driver behind the carbon removals market, invests in Indigo’s carbon credits, it affirms their confidence in our science, team, and technology. Our microbial and sustainability portfolio spans 20 million acres across 15 countries, and this deal underscores the trust in farmers’ hard work to create a healthy and resilient agri-food system.” Microsoft is by far the largest corporate buyer of carbon removal credits globally, with the company recently reporting that it contracted nearly 22 million tons of carbon removal last year alone as part of its efforts to become carbon negative by 2030. In just the past few weeks, the company has announced a series of large-scale carbon removal purchases across a broad range of technologies including biochar , forest management , bio-energy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) , and reforestation , among others. Brian Marrs, Senior Director of Energy and Carbon Removal at Microsoft, said: “Indigo’s work to create resilient farms and secure watersheds across the U.S. delivers measurable climate benefits as well as improved soil and water health and new economic development opportunities in rural communities. We conduct extensive due diligence when choosing projects for our portfolio, and are pleased to support this project as part of Microsoft’s broader portfolio of high-quality carbon removal solutions.

According to the company, the new green hydrogen plant will be one of the largest of its kind in Europe, and will supply its nearby Schwechat refinery, with an expected CO2 emissions reduction of approximately 150,000 tons per year. Green hydrogen is viewed as one of the key building blocks of the transition to a cleaner energy future, particularly for industrial and transport sectors with difficult to abate emissions, in which renewable energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical. Around 90 million metric tons of hydrogen are produced annually, although the vast majority is extracted using fossil fuels, which create pollutants and GHG emissions. The development of clean hydrogen capacity, such as green hydrogen, which uses renewable energy to power the process to extract hydrogen from other materials, will require massive investments in areas including infrastructure, electrolysis, and transport. According to OMV, the new facility is expected to start-up at the end of 2027, and will produce green hydrogen using renewable energy from wind, solar, and hydro power. The new project follows the completion in 2024 of a 10 MW electrolyzer facility built in 2024 in partnership with Kommunalkredit, an Austrian bank specializing in financing infrastructure. As one of the first green hydrogen production plants in Europe, it has been certified as Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBO) under the EU Renewable Energy Directive (RED) legislation. Martijn van Koten, OMV Executive Vice President Fuels & Feedstock and Chemicals, said: “With this project, we are re-inventing the production of everyday essential fuels and chemical products – a groundbreaking step that demonstrates how industrial innovation and sustainability can go hand in hand. By using green hydrogen in the future, we are making the processes and production of fuels and chemical products more sustainable and are future-proofing our industry.” In 2022, OMV launched its “Strategy 2030” to shift from oil & gas production to renewable fuels and circular solutions and become a net zero emissions company by 2050.

The new net zero goal represents a more ambitious target than the company’s prior goal to achieve carbon neutrality across the value chain by 2050, expanding its initiative to encompass all GHG emissions. Hitachi added that it will contribute to decarbonization by offering high-efficiency products, innovative services and future technologies. Hitachi also announced that its new 2050 emission reduction targets have been validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), as aligned with the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit global warming to 1.5°C. Hitachi’s new net zero target is part of a larger update to the company’s Environmental Innovation 2050 strategy, which it began implementing in 2016 to meet goals for decarbonization, improving resource and water efficiency and protecting ecosystems. Under the updated strategy, Hitachi also expanded its initial goal for more efficient use of water and other resources to an aim for a more circular economy, including the reuse and recycling of materials and extending the life of products. The company added that it will increase its involvement in the mitigation of natural disasters, and promote recovery through its business operations and solutions. The company also revealed new 2030 targets under each of its Decarbonization, Circular Economy and Nature Positive pillars, including goals to reach carbon neutrality at its factories and offices and a 52% reduction in GHG emissions in the value chain, zero landfill waste and eco-design for all relevant product groups, a 10% water usage reduction, and to conduct an impact assessment on and from nature in the value chain. In a statement announcing the updated sustainability strategy, Hitachi said: “In recent years, environmental risks have intensified. These include soaring electricity demand driven by generative AI, growing geopolitical risks on mineral resources for manufacturing products like batteries and increasing severity of natural disasters. As society seeks innovative solutions such as the expansion of non-fossil energy, shifting to circular business models, and restoration of natural capital, Hitachi has responded with an update to its environmental vision.” ESG Today Writing Staff Related Posts Companies / Honeywell, Johnson Matthey, GIDARA and Samsung Launch Alliance to Accelerate, Reduce Cost of SAF Production Environment / Nippon Steel to Invest $6 Billion to Decarbonize Steelmaking Companies / Infosys Sets New Goal to Remove More Carbon than it Emits by 2030 ‹ Microsoft Buys Over 600,000 Tons of Green Cement to Help Build Sustainable Materials Market › Watershed Launches Free Emissions Database to Enable More Accurate Decarbonization Decisions ESG Today Newsletter – Subscribe Subscribe to the ESG Today Newsletter Join our mailing list for the latest breaking ESG investment news!

The Commission released its Omnibus I package in late February 2025, aimed at significantly reducing the sustainability reporting and regulatory burden on companies, with proposals for major changes to a series of regulations including the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), as well as the Taxonomy Regulation, and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Among the most changes included in the package is a proposal to have the CSRD apply to only companies with more than 1,000 employees and either revenue greater than €50 million net turnover, removing an estimated 80% of companies from the regulation’s sustainability reporting requirements, and for the CSDDD to require full human rights and environmental due diligence only at the level of direct business partners, and to require less frequent due diligence monitoring. The package also proposes limits on sustainability information requests on smaller companies. The ombudsman’s inquiry follows a complaint made by a group of organizations, including ClientEarth, Notre Affaire A Tous, Clean Clothes Campaign, European Coalition for Corporate Justice, Global Witness, Transport & Environment, Antislavery International and Friends of the Earth Europe. The organizations argued that the Commission failed to comply with the “Better Regulation Guidelines,” which set out the principles that the European Commission follows when preparing new initiatives and proposals, by not carrying out a public consultation and conducting a proper impact assessment prior to launching the Omnibus proposals. The organizations also complained that the Commission failed to carry out a climate consistency assessment, a requirement under the European Climate Law requiring an assessment of the consistency of EU and national policies with the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality goal. In a letter to the EU Commission President, Anjinho said that the complaint was the third received by her office “in recent months concerning the Commission’s compliance with legal requirements, its Better Regulation Guidelines and further rules in preparing legislative proposals,” adding: “It is clear that the issues raised in these three complaints raise a number of important issues for the Ombudsman.” The ombudsman provided a series of questions for the Commission, including asking the Commission to “elaborate on the reasons for its decision not to carry out a public consultation for this proposal,” and for more detail on “meetings with companies and other stakeholders” that the Commission held in February 2025. The ombudsman also asked the Commission to “explain the “urgency”” behind its decision not to conduct an impact assessment, and if it carried out a climate consistency assessment for the proposal. In a statement released following the ombudsman’s announcement, the eight organizations said: “This swift and decisive action by the EU Ombudsman underlines the importance of the issues raised in our complaint. The Commission’s rushed rollbacks of three key components of the Green Deal – including laws aimed at tackling the environmental and human costs of global value chains – has completely disregarded the rights of both people and the planet.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The clarification, provided in a press conference by government spokesperson Stefan Kornelius, follows comments earlier this month by German Chancellor Friedrich Merz to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen saying that he expects the EU to “cancel this directive,” referring to the CSDDD. Shortly after Merz’s comments, French President Emmanuel Macron similarly called to push the CSDDD regulation “out of the table,” adding that France’s position was “very aligned now with Chancellor Merz.” The CSDDD was initially proposed by the European Commission in February 2022, setting out obligations for companies to identify, assess, prevent, mitigate, address and remedy impacts on people and planet – ranging from child labor and slavery to pollution and emissions, deforestation and damage to ecosystems – in their upstream supply chain and some downstream activities such as distribution and recycling. The legislation was adopted in May 2024 , but only after a long process that ultimately required revisions in the legislation that significantly scaled back the number of companies covered by the law, and extended the timeline to its full implementation. As part of the EU Commission’s Omnibus process launched in February 2025, aimed at significantly reducing the sustainability reporting and regulatory burden on companies, implementation of the CSDDD has been delayed by a year to 2028, and a series of changes to the directive have been proposed, including requiring full due diligence only at the level of direct business partners, reducing the frequency of monitoring the effectiveness of due diligence from annual to every 5 years, and limiting the amount of information that can be requested from small companies. Merz’s call to scrap the CSDDD followed a coalition agreement to form a government in Germany in April that included eliminating Germany’s own human rights and environmental supply chain due diligence law, the Supply Chain Act (LkSG). As part of the coalition agreement, though, the LkSG was to be replaced with the EU’s CSDDD law. In response to a question regarding the apparent contradiction between the Chancellor’s comments and his commitment under the coalition agreement, Kornelius said that in addition to eliminating the LkSG, the coalition aims to “de-bureaucratize the European framework in line with the Commission President’s proposals in the Omnibus Act,” adding that the coalition is currently working on proposals to that end with the Commission. While not specifying the proposed changes to the CSDDD, Kornelius added: “As part of the EU Commission’s reform efforts to streamline bureaucracy, the aim is also to streamline the European Supply Chain Directive in its comprehensive impact.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The suit alleges that the firms violated the Clayton Act, which prohibits the acquisition of shares of companies in which “the effect of such acquisition may be substantially to lessen competition,” and claims that the firms “effectively formed a syndicate and agreed to use their collective holdings of publicly traded coal companies to induce industry-wide output reductions,” by joining initiatives such as the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative (NZAM) and Climate Action 100+, noting that each initiative requires commitments from asset managers to engage with portfolio companies to align with climate goals. Notably, the asset managers have since exited or significantly reduced their participation in the climate initiatives, often citing the group’s overly prescriptive requirements, although the suit claimed that withdrawal “does not change the reality that Defendants’ holdings threaten to substantially reduce competition.” In a statement released announcing the federal agencies’ filing of a brief supporting the case,  FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson said that the asset managers “allegedly blocked the production of American coal in the name of climate change scaremongering, all so they could take money out of the pockets of American consumers and put it in theirs,” adding that the Trump administration “has vowed to fight left-wing ideologues who seek to make us weaker and poorer under the guise of ESG. “ Similarly, the DOJ’s Assistant Attorney General Abigail A. Slater said: “We will not hesitate to stand up against powerful financial firms that use Americans’ retirement savings to harm competition under the guise of ESG.” In its response, BlackRock argued that “the DOJ and FTC’s support for this baseless case undermines the Trump Administration’s goal of American energy independence,” and that the case is trying to re-write antitrust law and is based on an absurd theory that coal companies conspired with their shareholders to reduce coal production.” While the FTC and DOJ said that their aim is to “protect markets from anticompetitive behavior that raises Americans’ energy bills,” BlackRock claimed that the case would have the opposite effect, arguing that “forcing asset managers to divest from coal companies will harm their ability to access capital and invest in their businesses and employees, likely leading to higher energy prices.” State Street also issued a statement calling the lawsuit “baseless,” and adding that “additional filings do not change our assessment,” adding that the firm “acts in the long-term financial interests of investors with a focus on enhancing shareholder value.” In a statement released on the underlying suit, Vanguard similarly argued that the suit “contorts the law in a way that will hurt individual investors,” adding that the firm “will continue to defend our long history of safeguarding and promoting long-term investment returns on behalf of Vanguard-advised funds and their investors.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

According to the Commission, the projects, located across Germany, Spain, Finland, Norway and the Netherlands, are expected to produce nearly 2.2 million tonnes of renewable hydrogen over ten years, avoiding more than 15 million tonnes of C02 emissions. Hydrogen is viewed as one of the key building blocks of the transition to a cleaner energy future, particularly for industrial and transport sectors with difficult to abate emissions, in which renewable energy solutions such as wind or solar are less practical. Around 90 million metric tons of hydrogen are produced annually, although the vast majority is extracted using fossil fuels, which create pollutants and GHG emissions. The development of clean hydrogen capacity, such as green hydrogen, which uses renewable energy to power the process to extract hydrogen from other materials, will require massive investments in areas including infrastructure, electrolysis, and transport. The awards follow the EU’s second European Hydrogen Bank (EHB) auction. In 2022, the EU Commission announced plans to dramatically scale up hydrogen production in Europe, and proposed a Hydrogen Accelerator, envisioning scaling renewable hydrogen domestic production to 10 million tons. In 2023, the Commission launched its inaugural European Hydrogen Bank auction, aimed at helping stimulate investments in renewable hydrogen production capacity and bring production to scale, by bridging the gap between the price of production and the price consumers are currently willing to pay, in a market where non-renewable hydrogen is still cheaper to produce. The Commission said that a third European Hydrogen Bank auction is planned for end 2025 with a budget of up to €1 billion, and that it will also soon launch a “Hydrogen Mechanism” under the European Hydrogen Bank, creating an online platform to bring together buyers and sellers and enable market participants to share information and find potential commercial partners. Teresa Ribera, EU Commission Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition, said: “The second auction under the European Hydrogen Bank reaffirms our commitment to building a robust renewable hydrogen market in Europe — one that is key to achieving climate neutrality in a cost-effective and competitive way. We are increasing EUs energy independence with positive impacts in security and jobs.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

According to STOXX and ICE, the new indices are being launched amidst increasing demand by investors for index based investing, and for climate-focused fixed income solutions. The new benchmarks include investment grade indices in currencies including U.S. dollars, euros, and sterling, among others, as well as high-yield bond indices in dollars and euros. Axel Lomholt, General Manager at STOXX, said: “Working with ICE Data Indices enables us to accelerate the delivery of fixed income benchmarks tailored to market demand. This collaboration brings together two leading financial companies and skill sets to launch and operate a suite of indices that addresses the growing demand for sustainable investment products in the bond market.” The new indices include products aimed at complying with and exceeding the requirements of the EU’s Paris-aligned Benchmarks (PAB) and Climate Transition Benchmarks (CTB).  Indices that are labeled as PABs must meet criteria for asset selection that results in the index aligning with the long-term climate goals of the Paris Agreement. Criteria include a minimum reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity of at least 50% compared to the market index, with annual GHG emissions intensity reductions of at least 7%, among others. CTB criteria also include 7% annual decarbonization, and a 30% minimum reduction in GHG emissions intensity relative to the market index. The methodology underlying the indices’ construction includes overweighting companies that have GHG reduction targets under the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) and target a minimum ‘green-to-brown’ revenue ratio, while utilizing optimization to reduce the turnover and to track the performance of parent indices. The indices also include screens to exclude companies based on global norms, product involvement, controversies and activities that hinder certain UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). According to the companies, under the new collaboration, ICE will be responsible for pricing, reference data and index calculation services for the new indices, while STOXX, which developed the indices, will provide proprietary data and oversee the administration of the indices. Chris Edmonds, President of ICE Fixed Income and Data Services, said: “By combining STOXX’s experience in sustainability data and methodologies with our leading fixed income pricing, reference data and index calculation solutions, together we are creating powerful new benchmark products combining the expertise of two globally recognized and respected providers of data to fixed income markets.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Eni CCUS Holding encompasses several large-scale European CCUS projects, including the UK-based Hynet, aimed at capturing CO2 emitted by industrial plants in the North West of England and North Wales for permanent storage in depleted gas fields in the Irish Sea, and with a potential capacity of up to 10 million tonnes per year by 2030, and the UK’s Bacton, also targeting 10 million tonnes annually by 2030, as well as the 5 million tonne oer year L10 project in the Netherlands. Hynet was among the sites selected as part of the UK government’s £21.7 billion investment program last year for the development of new “carbon capture clusters” in the UK. Eni CCUS Holding also has the future right to acquire the Ravenna project in Italy, a CCUS joint venture between Eni and Snam, anticipated to store up to 4 million tonnes of CO2 per year by 2030. According to Eni, the agreement follows a selection process involving several prominent international players who expressed strong interest in the company, and under the final agreement under negotiation, GIP will support investments in the CCUS projects. Eni also stated that in the medium to long-term, additional prospects could be added to build a wide platform of CCUS projects. BlackRock acquired GIP in 2024 for $12.5 billion, citing emerging long-term opportunities in areas including decarbonization, energy security, digital infrastructure, and supply chain transitions. Eni added that the agreement forms part of its “satellite model,” aimed at attracting capital from partners to fund growth and highlight the value creation of its new businesses, while preserving free cash flow from traditional businesses for shareholder distribution. Under the strategy, Eni has recently entered into negotiations with Ares for the sale of a $2.2 billion stake in Eni’s renewables, retail and EV charging company Plenitude, and the company also sold a 25% stake in its mobility transformation and biofuels-focused business Enilive in 2024 to KKR.

The new ESG approach covers the entire scope of La Banque Postale’s financial savings products, which spans areas including ordinary securities accounts, life insurance, and Share Savings Plans from across the group’s business units which include CNP Assurances, LBP AM, and Louvre Banque Privée. The bank added that extra- financial factors are now central to the advisory approach of its relationship managers, beyond their regulatory duties on risk and sustainability disclosures. Stéphane Dedeyan, Chairman of the Management Board of La Banque Postale, said: “Beyond our strong commitments to biodiversity and the decarbonization of our operations, we want to help our clients take part in the transition through accessible and educational products. With this new segmentation of our financial savings offer, we are reaffirming our leadership in responsible finance by helping our customers direct their investments towards ESG-aligned options. This is a significant step forward for our bank and for our customers.” Under the new approach, La Banque Postale will offer its ESG-based financial savings products in a three-tier structure, designed to allow customers to engage based on their level of ESG interest. The first tier will be focused on managing ESG risk by screening out companies deemed incompatible with environmental protection, respect for social and human rights and good governance, such as those with activities linked to tobacco, chemical and biological weapons, and activities at risk of deforestation or linked to violations of fundamental ethical standards, as well as fossil fuel companies with the worst environmental impacts. The second tier will select companies with the best ESG practices in terms of environmental protection, respect for social and human rights and governance, while excluding companies that are least involved, such as fossil fuel companies that fail to show a commitment to the energy transition and continue to develop new fossil fuel projects. The third tier will focus on the most impact-driven investment solutions, by selecting assets that contribute to ESG-focused areas such as protecting the environment, from biodiversity to social inclusion, such as companies linked to key sectors of the just transition, essential services such as access to health, education and water, circular economy, protection of biodiversity and regional development. Sarah Bouquerel, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of La Banque Postale retail bank and Director of the LBP Business Unit at CNP Assurances, said: “We have designed this new segmentation of our financial savings to meet the expectations of our customers, who want to invest responsibly and transparently. By offering them products that are in line with their values, we enable them to contribute to the ecological and social transition of the territories, in addition to the financial performance of their investments.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The agreement follows an alert issued in November 2023 by the BEUC, along with member organizations from 13 countires against bottling companies including Coca-Cola, Danone and Nestlé, reporting that the companies were making misleading commercial claims about the recyclability of their products. The BEUC specifically highlighted three claims of concern, including “100% recyclable,”  noting that recyclability depended on factors such as the available infrastructure to collect material, the effectiveness of the sorting process, or appropriate recycling processes; “100% recycled,” noting that bottle lids and most labels are not made of recycled materials and virgin plastic is often also added, and; use of green imagery. The Commission said that it was contacted by Coca-Cola following the alert, with the company voluntarily engaging with the EU’s Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) network. Following the dialogue, Coca-Cola made a series of commitments, including replacing claims on bottles such as “I am a bottle made from 100% recycled plastic” with clearer statements such as “This bottle, excluding label and cap, is made from 100% recycled plastic,” and labels such as “Recycle me again” with “Recycle me.” Coca-Cola also committed to ensure that the overall impression of the label and the marketing is not misleading consumers regarding environmental benefits of the packaging, the Commission said, and that digital marketing campaigns on the company’s website and social media channels reflect the content of its new commitments. The BEUC welcomed the new commitments by Coca-Cola, but said that some of the issues that it raised remain unresolved. Agustín Reyna, Director General of BEUC, said: “It is good news that Coca-Cola has heeded consumers’ call and commits to clarify that its ‘100%’ recycling claims only apply to parts of the bottle. However, if it’s written in small print, the ‘100%’ figure will keep giving the impression that it’s harmless to the environment to buy plastic bottles.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The publication follows the adoption by the European Commission in late 2024 of the ESG Rating Regulation, aimed at improving the reliability, transparency and comparability of ESG ratings and boosting investor confidence in sustainable financial products. The process behind the regulation began in 2021, with the issuance of a letter by ESMA to the European Commission, advising that the current unregulated status of the ESG ratings sector and the resulting lack of transparency posed a potential risk to investors. In July 2021, the Commission launched a new Sustainable Finance Strategy , which included a pledge to take action to improve the reliability, comparability and transparency of ESG ratings, and subsequently asked ESMA to begin examining the market participants. The regulation places ESG ratings providers under the authority of ESMA, with providers required to be authorized and supervised by the regulator, and to comply with transparency requirements into areas including methodologies used for ratings and sources of information. The new proposed rules focus on a few key areas of compliance for providers, including the information required to be provided when applying for authorization and recognition as an ESG ratings provider, safeguards to be put in place to mitigate conflicts of interest, and information required to be disclosed to the public, issuers, and users of ESG ratings. While the EU Commission’s initial proposed regulation required a separation of certain business activities from ESG ratings, with ratings providers not allowed to provide other services such as consulting activities to investors, issuance of credit ratings, and some other investment services, the final regulation allowed providers to offer the services if measures are put in place to avoid potential conflicts of interest. ESMA’s proposed rules includes criteria that must be put in place for ESG ratings providers to offer the other services, with providers required to put in place separate organizational structures and working environments for employees providing ESG ratings and those providing the other services, with the regulator stressing that its rules ensure that the separation is not just “superficial” or “mere legal formalities.” Disclosure requirements for ESG ratings providers under the new rules would include the publication of the methodology, models and key rating assumptions used in deriving ESG ratings, as well as the sequence in which the information should be provided, in order to help users to identify where the information is located, aiding the regulation’s objective of increasing transparency and comparability. Alongside the release of the draft RTS, ESMA launched a consultation on the proposed new rules, which will remain open until June 20, 2025. ESMA added that it expects to publish a final report and submit the draft RTS to the Commission for adoption in October 2025. Click here to access the consultation paper on the new RTS.

The central bank signaled last year that it would begin work on updating the expectations, based on its learnings over the past five years. According to the BoE’s Prudential Regulatory Authority (PRA), its review indicated that while “firms have made progress, their capabilities to identify and manage climate-related risk are still at an early stage,” with the regulator adding that banks’ frameworks for climate-related risk management “are still in their infancy.” The PRA noted that most banks have yet to establish climate-related risk metrics or to define a “climate-specific risk appetite,” adding that “many firms do not currently consider climate-related risk to be a material risk, yet this conclusion is not based on an adequate assessment of climate-related risk exposures.” For insurers, the PRA said that while most have “embedded some form of climate-related risk within their risk appetite statement,” it noted that risk management processes are still at early stages of development, adding that “current metrics often do not directly quantify climate-related financial risks and, therefore, do not allow insurers to measure and monitor their climate exposures against risk appetite.” Among the key proposals introduced by the BoE is the placement of a greater emphasis on scenario analysis, with firms encouraged to enhance their scenario analysis capabilities, and to demonstrate understanding of the outputs of the scenarios and their use of the information to assess exposure to climate-related risks and to inform their decision-making. The proposals also include expectations for firms to identify and assess data gaps that act as barriers to management of climate-related risks, and to have in place plans to manage and close the gaps, as well as to improve oversight and controls on the use of data from external providers. Additionally, the proposals set expectations for banks and insurers to more formally assess their climate-related risk appetites, including ensuring that boards periodically review risk appetite, climate-related risk management practices and strategy, and that firms’ management should demonstrate how the risk appetite and strategy relate to developments in climate-related risks to their business models. The central bank launched a consultation on the new proposals, which will remain open until July 30, 2025. In a speech announcing the launch of the consultation, David Bailey, Executive Director of Prudential Policy at the BoE, said: “Effective risk management at firms will help create a more resilient financial system that can withstand the increase in the frequency and severity of climate events that we are experiencing and any changes in the transition pathway. This is essential for supporting both the sustainable growth and the competitiveness of the UK economy over the medium to long term.” Click here to access the consultation paper.

The proposal, announced in April 2024, followed the release by the FCA of its SDR requirements for asset managers in November 2023, which included an anti-greenwashing rule for sustainability-related product claims, as well as rules for naming and marketing funds based on their sustainability characteristics, and for the use of a new sustainable investment product labelling regime. While the initial SDR was developed primarily for retail investors, the new proposal would extend the requirements to firms that manage a group of investments for consumers, with a focus on wealth management services for individuals and model portfolios for retail investors. Following its industry consultation on the new proposal, however, the FCA said in February 2025 that it would delay its plans to publish a Policy Statement on the proposal in Q2 2025, and in its new update, the regulator said that it has now “decided that it is not the right time to finalise rules on extending SDR to portfolio management.” Among the key feedback responses highlighted in its update, the FCA said that respondents called for more time to make the necessary changes to comply with the SDR, as well as for calls for greater clarity in areas including the application of naming rules to different types of portfolios and client relationships, the interaction of the FCA’s proposed disclosures with other sustainability reporting requirements, and how labelling criteria would work in practice for portfolio managers, among other factors. The FCA said: “Overall, there is broad support for extending SDR to portfolio management, with most respondents agreeing this is an important step toward improving consumer outcomes. However, we want to take time to carefully consider the challenges and ensure that portfolio managers are positioned to implement the regime effectively before introducing requirements.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Based on information disclosed by banks as part of their Pillar 3 ESG disclosures, the new dashboard covers climate risk from both a transition and physical perspective, with indicators showing levels of green financing, based on alignment with the EU Taxonomy, in addition to considering internal definitions of green finance used by institutions. According to the EBA, the information provided through the new dashboard indicates that the EU banking sector may be facing significant exposure to climate-related transition risk, with the data finding that exposure by banks to corporates from sectors highly contributing to climate change is above 70% in most countries, and 61% overall as of June 2024. Notably, however, the average exposure declined from 64% at the end of 2023. The EBA said that the risk exposure may be significant “especially if companies are affected by policy measures related to sustainability objectives, if a need to invest in technological change arises, or are affected by changing consumer preferences.” Physical risk exposure appears to be much lower for banks than transition risk, with the indicator an average share of exposures in areas subject to elevated physical risk below 30% in most countries. The dashboard also found that the green asset ratio (GAR) remains low, with an average loan GAR across the EU/EEA of 6% as of mid-2024, although the EBA noted that this is partly “due to the fact that the economy is still under transition, with at this stage few activities being able to demonstrate alignment with the Taxonomy criteria.” Notably, loan GAR climbed to 6% from 5.8% at the end of 2023. The EBA said that it will regularly update and evolve the dashboard’s indicators over time. Click here to access the EBA’s ESG dashboard.

According to the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA), the umbrella organization of Canada’s provincial and territorial securities regulators, the move to pause the development of new sustainability reporting requirements is being made “to support Canadian markets and issuers as they adapt to the recent developments in the U.S. and globally.” The announcement follows a series significant changes in the sustainability reporting landscape in major markets, with the EU in the midst of its “Omnibus” process to delay, reduce the scope and simplify disclosure requirements under its CSRD legislation, and the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission in the process of entirely abandoning its climate-related reporting rules. Stan Magidson, Chair of the CSA and Chair and CEO of the Alberta Securities Commission said: “In recent months, the global economic and geopolitical landscape has rapidly and significantly changed, resulting in increased uncertainty and rising competitiveness concerns for Canadian issuers. In response, the CSA is focusing on initiatives to make Canadian markets more competitive, efficient and resilient.” The CSA move marks a significant and rapid change in direction for the Canadian regulators. As recently as December, the Canadian Sustainability Standards Board (CSSB) published finalized ISSB-based Canadian Sustainability Disclosure Standards. Following the CSSB release, the CSA stated that it was continuing its work towards a mandatory revised climate-related disclosure rule that would consider the new standards. In its new update, the CSA said that the “CSSB standards provide a useful voluntary disclosure framework for sustainability and climate-related disclosure,” and encouraged issuers to refer to the standards when preparing disclosures. Commenting on the CSA move, Wendy Berman, Incoming Chair of the CSSB said: “We recognize that regulatory approaches may evolve in response to market conditions, but the demand for credible, comparable sustainability information continues to grow – both globally and at home.” Sustainability-focused groups criticized the CSA announcement, expressing concerns that a lack of mandatory reporting requirements would increase risks for investors and companies. Julie Segal, Senior Manager of Climate Finance at Environmental Defence Canada said: “The CSA is being regressive. Postponing requirements for businesses to get prepared for climate change and align with positive climate action will only leave businesses less prepared, investors less informed, and Canada’s economy less competitive. Protecting Canada means requiring full climate risk disclosures and credible transition plans.” The CSA said that it will “monitor domestic and international regulatory developments with respect to climate-related and diversity-related disclosures,” and that it expects to revisit the projects to pursue requirements for issuers “in future years.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

In a statement following the announcement, DWS said that it has “acknowledged that in the past our marketing was sometimes exuberant,” and that the firm has already improved its internal documentation and control processes. The announcement concludes a long-standing greenwashing saga for the asset manager, which began in August 2021, with allegations by DWS’ former sustainability chief Desiree Fixler that the firm misrepresented in its annual report on the extent to which assets were invested using ESG integration in the investment process. In May 2022 police raided the Frankfurt offices of DWS and Deutsche Bank as part the greenwashing investigation. DWS CEO Asoka Woehrmann resigned the following day . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) launched its own investigation into the allegations, with DWS agreeing in 2023 to a $19 million fine to settle the charges, marking the largest-ever greenwashing penalty to date imposed on an asset manager by the SEC. The Frankfurt prosecutor said that its investigation found that DWS’ claims to be a “leader” in ESG or that “ESG is an integral part of our DNA,” gave the impression that the firm held a market-leading position in ESG investigation that “did not correspond to reality,” as the firm was still undergoing a “transformation process.” The prosecutor added that “statements in external relations must not go beyond what can actually be implemented.” In its statement, DWS said that it welcomed “the conclusion of the ESG investigation,” adding that the fine will not affect the firm’s Q1 2025 results, as it has already made provisions for the penalty.

The new platform is being launched with €350 million (USD$394 million) in equity commitments from investors including Alba Infra Partners, Mirova, and the Banque des Territoires. Founded in 2016, Paris-based Neot develops and manages investment platforms dedicated to low-carbon mobility projects following a model of enabling the financing of ambitious infrastructure projects led by public authorities and transport operators by removing barriers related to CapEx and technology risk. The firm launched its flagship platform Neot Green Mobility (NGM), also with the support of Alba, Mirova and Banque des Territoires, which invests in vehicles, charging stations, and batteries for vehicles, and then leases them to transport operators. and has financed over €350 million in mobility assets and raised €170 million in debt to support its development, primarily in France, the UK, and Scandinavia. Neot is owned by Forsee Power, Mitsui & Co., Ltd., and EDF, via its corporate venture arm, EDF Pulse Ventures. Following the model of Neot Green Mobility, the new Neot e-mission platform will offer tailor-made “as-a-service” financing solutions for low-carbon transport – including buses, coaches, trucks, boats, and charging infrastructure – on behalf of public authorities and transport operators, with Alba and Mirova focused on financing projects at the European level and beyond through Neot e-motion, and Banque des Territoires concentrating on the French market, through Neot e-motion France, a subsidiary of Neot e-motion. Philippe Ringenbach, CEO of Neot, Capital, said: “With Neot e-motion, we are reaching a new milestone alongside trusted partners who have supported us since Neot’s inception. The renewal of their commitment reflects the strength of our model and the shared vision that unites us. With nearly €500 million in equity, we now have an unprecedented level of financial capacity to support regions and transport operators in their transition to low-carbon mobility.” Stéphane Grandguillaume, Chairman of Alba Infra Partners, added: “We are very pleased to continue this journey with our long-standing industrial and financial partners to support the decarbonization of heavy transport in Europe. Neot e-motion’s projects play a central role in the energy transition, and we are confident that its business will continue to grow as the deployment of electric buses, coaches, boats, and trucks picks up pace, along with the increasing adoption of leasing models. By supporting transport operators in their shift toward green mobility, Neot e-motion is also contributing to the European Union’s energy independence.” ESG Today Writing Staff Related Posts Energy Transition / Honeywell, Johnson Matthey, GIDARA and Samsung Launch Alliance to Accelerate, Reduce Cost of SAF Production Sustainable Finance / Blended Finance Initiative SCALED to Launch Platform for Private Capital in Emerging Markets Energy Transition / Nippon Steel to Invest $6 Billion to Decarbonize Steelmaking ‹ Patria Launches New Platform to Invest $1 Billion in Clean Energy-Powered Data Centers › JPMorgan Signs Large-Scale Carbon Removal Deal for Under $200 per Ton ESG Today Newsletter – Subscribe Subscribe to the ESG Today Newsletter Join our mailing list for the latest breaking ESG investment news!

Morgan, with proceeds from the financing aimed at enabling the company to scale its carbon removal business globally. The new financing follows a $50 million award to Mati Carbon as the grand prize winner of the XPRIZE Carbon Removal competition. The competition, funded by Elon Musk and the Musk Foundation, aimed to catalyze new carbon removal solutions with the ability to scale sustainably to gigatonne scale, and was joined by more than 1,300 teams from over 88 countries. Founded in 2022, Houston-based Mati’s projects focus on applying finely crushed basalt over agricultural lands in India to accelerate a natural weathering process that permanently draws down atmospheric CO2. In addition to removing CO2, Mati’s solution also positively impacts smallholder farmers with increased income, in addition to benefits including improved crop productivity and soil replenishment. Mati’s current CDR credit buyers include Shopify and H&M. The company also deploys a Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework, developed in partnership with IIT Kanpur and Yale University,  for measuring key soil properties and quantifying carbon removal. The MRV system was a key factor in the XPRIZE award. Mati said that the new financing will support the rapid expansion of its technology and operations across India and Sub-Saharan Africa, with the funds to be deployed to expand ERW deployments to new geographies, acquire world-class, high-tech regional laboratory facilities, and develop strategic partnerships to accelerate the global adoption of ERW. The company expects to partner with 30,000 smallholder farmers by the end of 2025 across the Global South, including India, Tanzania, and Zambia. Shantanu Agarwal, Founder and CEO of Mati Carbon, said: “This is a transformative development for climate technology and adaptation financing. With support from J.P. Morgan, we will be able to scale the impact and reach of Enhanced Rock Weathering to many more smallholder farmers and prove that high-integrity carbon removal is both financially viable and deeply impactful.” Blended finance brings together public or philanthropic capital and private funding through a common investment structure, enabling investors to invest in certain types of investments that have high perceived risk profiles, such as new climate mitigation-related technologies. The new blended facility by J.P. Morgan is backed by credit support from the Schmidt Family Foundation, created by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Kelly Belcher, Head of Climate Tech at J.P. Morgan, said: “J.P. Morgan is pleased to support Mati Carbon’s next phase of growth as they work to bring Enhanced Rock Weathering technology to communities around the world. This work is actively helping to decarbonize the globe, grow local economies and build a more sustainable future.” Patrick McGrath from The Schmidt Family Foundation added: “Mati’s approach to Enhanced Rock Weathering has the potential to scale into a major carbon removal solution, and partnerships like this are critical to unlocking that potential. Working together, we can accelerate the path to large-scale deployment while delivering meaningful co-benefits for smallholder farmers in the Global South. This collaboration demonstrates how innovative approaches – in technology and in finance – can drive both climate impact and economic opportunity.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The new initiative is being launched as demand for sustainability-related skills is increasing globally as companies and countries globally begin to take action on implementing their climate and sustainability-related commitments, and to meet growing sustainability reporting and regulatory compliance requirements. Arif Amiri, Chief Executive Officer of DIFC Authority, said: “DIFC is proud to be leading the way in advancing sustainability in the region. The ‘1 Million Learners’ initiative is a testament to our belief that real impact begins with education. By working closely with our valued partners, we are making sustainability knowledge more accessible and ensuring the region remains at the forefront of global sustainable transformation.” The initiative is backed by a coalition of 29 founding partners, among them international firms, institutions, and organizations including London Stock Exchange Group, Mastercard, Oxford & Cambridge Society of the UAE, PwC Middle East, S&P Global, United Nations Development Program, and Visa. GIST Impact, an international organization that quantifies environmental, social and economic outcomes, will ensure that the program delivers measurable outcomes, DIFC added. DIFC added that it has appointed impact data and analytics provider GIST Impact as its impact knowledge partner for the initiative, to ensure that the program delivers measurable outcomes. GIST Impact said: “This programme marks a meaningful step toward building widespread impact literacy. We look forward to helping shape the tools, knowledge, and practices that will empower the current and next generation of decision-makers.” ESG Today Writing Staff Related Posts ESG Tools, Services / TPG Acquires Energy Software and Data Analytics Platform Aurora Professional bodies / IATA Launches SAF Registry to Facilitate Global Sustainable Aviation Fuel Market Sustainable Finance / Blended Finance Initiative SCALED to Launch Platform for Private Capital in Emerging Markets ‹ Shell Faces New Legal Action Aimed at Stopping New Oil & Gas Projects › Octopus Launches New Fund to Give Investors Access to Clean Energy Investment Opportunities ESG Today Newsletter – Subscribe Subscribe to the ESG Today Newsletter Join our mailing list for the latest breaking ESG investment news!

The Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation, in application since 2021, sets out how financial market participants, such as asset managers, have to communicate sustainability information to investors, regarding the integration of sustainability risks and the consideration of adverse sustainability impacts in their processes and the provision of sustainability‐related information with respect to financial products. The regulation’s underlying goals include helping to attract private funding to facilitate the transition towards greater sustainability, and helping companies pursue transition-related opportunities. The new call for evidence forms part of a comprehensive review of the SFDR framework launched by the Commission in 2023. To date, the Commission said that feedback received as part of the review process has revealed that while widespread support for the regulation’s objectives is strong, key challenges in implementing and using the SFDR exist, including a lack of legal clarity on key concepts, limited relevance of some of the disclosure requirements, and inconsistencies with other parts of the EU’s sustainable finance framework, as well as issues related to data availability. The Commission has also previously expressed concern that the SFDR’s classification system, such as the Article 8 and 9 classifications, were being used as de-facto sustainability quality labels, raising potential greenwashing risks. In order to address these issues, the EU Commission said that its review aims to increase the legal clarity of the SFDR rules, and ensure its coherence within the sustainable finance framework, including the EU’s in-process measures to reduce sustainability reporting obligations for companies. Specific aims highlighted by the Commission include simplifying key concepts of the SFDR, and streamlining and reducing disclosure requirements, with a focus on the most essential information for investors. The Commission also said that it will explore the case for categorizing financial products that make sustainability-related claims. Potential categories would reflect the various sustainability objectives of the financial products, such as products contributing to a sustainability objective, products contributing to the transition, or products contributing to other ESG strategies, the Commission added. The call for evidence will remain open through May 30, 2025. The Commission has said that it aims to publish its SFDR revision in Q4 2025. Click here to access the call for evidence.

For the survey, conducted in partnership with business school HEC Paris, #WeAreEurope collected responses from business leaders involved in CSRD implementation at more than 1,000 companies in 26 countries across Europe, encompassing a wide range of sectors and company sizes. 40% of executives surveyed held C-level positions in their companies. The survey was conducted following the release in late February of the Commission’s Omnibus I package , aimed at significantly reducing the sustainability reporting and regulatory burden on companies, with proposals for major changes to a series of regulations including the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), as well as the Taxonomy Regulation, and the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). Key proposed changes to the CSRD in the package include a dramatic reduction in scope, moving the regulation to cover only companies with more than 1,000 employees from the current 250 employee threshold, removing an estimated 80% of companies from the regulation’s sustainability reporting requirements. The proposal also aims to significantly reduce the number of data points included in the CSRD’s underlying European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS). Despite the political initiatives to reduce the scope reporting requirements of the CSRD, however, the report found significant report for the sustainability reporting regulation, with 61% of respondents reporting being somewhat or very satisfied with the CSRD in its current form, and only 17% reporting being dissatisfied. Even among companies slated to be removed from the regulation’s scope under the Omnibus proposals, only 25% of those with 250-499 employees and 17% of those with 500-999 employees reported being dissatisfied with the CSRD in its current form. When asked about the main strengths of the CSRD, 89% of respondents reported that the regulation improves ESG transparency for investors and other stakeholders, and 89% also said that it strengthens companies’ ESG strategy, risk assessment and impact management. Additionally, 88% said that the CSRD aligns with Europe’s economic, social, and environmental vision of companies, and nearly 80% agreed with its description as an efficient tool to help Europe achieve its sustainability ambitions. The survey also explored perceived weaknesses of the CSRD, with a lack of sufficient guidance to support reporting topping the list, cited by 69% of respondents, 63% reporting that it is disproportionate for the smallest companies, and 63% of respondents said that the preparation of CSRD reporting is too time consuming and costly. Notably, the response “it puts EU firms at a competitive disadvantage compared to non-EU firms because it is costly” was the least frequently chosen CSRD weakness, cited by only 37% of respondents. The report found that only 25% of executives are satisfied with the Omnibus proposals, with slightly over half reporting being dissatisfied. Satisfaction levels did not appear to vary significantly by company size, with less than 25% of companies with between 250 and 999 employees reporting being satisfied with the Omnibus proposals. The report also explored suggested solutions to correct weaknesses of the CSRD. Among companies that said that CSRD is too time-consuming and costly, 86% supported developing procedures to improve automation of data collection and report writing, and 82% supported reducing the number of mandatory indicators within the ESRS. Among companies that said that the CSRD regulation affects too many companies, only 27% supported the Omnibus proposal to raise the threshold to companies with 1,000 employees, with much stronger support, at 46%, to set a 500 employee threshold. Notably, even companies set to be removed from the scope of the CSRD supported the 500 company threshold, with even stronger than average support – 53%  – for this level among companies with 500-999 employees. Study co-leaders Professor François Gemenne, Academic Director of the Master in Sustainability and Social Innovation and Brian Hill, Academic Director of the S&O Inclusive Economy Center at HEC Paris, said: “In a context of geopolitical headwinds, the EU is currently faced with tough choices about the future some of its most ambitious sustainability-related policies, notably the CSRD. In today’s international climate, it alas bears repeating that policy choices such as these must be grounded on comprehensive, reliable information.  The EU’s decisions on the CSRD will have far-reaching consequences for businesses across the Union; their diverse perspectives should thus be heard and considered.” Click here to access the survey.

Ottawa-based Assent provides systems to help manufacturers collect and manage the supply chain data needed to meet environmentally and socially responsible product standards and regulations. According to Assent, the new solution will enable users to easily calculate embedded supply chain carbon emissions, meet CBAM requirements, and respond to customer sustainability demands. Adopted in 2023 , and coming into force in 2026, CBAM was established to avoid “carbon leakage,” a situation in which companies move production of emissions intensive goods to countries with less stringent environmental and climate policies. CBAM is aimed at equalizing the price of carbon paid for EU products operating under the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) – the EU’s internal cap and trade carbon pricing mechanism – with that paid for products produced in other countries, with companies that import into the EU required to purchase CBAM certificates in order to make up the difference. As part of the regulation, importers are required to report on the embedded emissions of goods imported into the EU, including direct emissions, and indirect emissions, with information including the electricity consumption of the production process. CBAM is undergoing proposed changes as part of the European Commission’s ongoing Omnibus package aimed at reducing the sustainability reporting and regulatory burden on companies. The most significant update to CBAM under the Commission’s proposals is the introduction of a new 50 tonne threshold, eliminating 90% of importers – primarily small and medium-sized enterprises – from the scope of the regulation. Despite removing approximately 182,000 importers, however, the Commission said that more than 99% of emissions from imports will still be covered by CBAM. Currently, according to Assent, fewer than 15% of manufacturers have the unified data needed to meet the emerging reporting requirements. The new solution includes a built-in carbon emissions calculator that enables suppliers to easily provide the data companies need to comply with CBAM’s strict methodology. It also enables manufacturers to store and map their supplier emissions data to their products within Assent’s network, helping companies minimize financial risk while gaining a competitive advantage by building a foundation for product carbon footprint tracking, the company said. Catherine Cormier, Chief Product Officer at Assent, said: “Manufacturers are under extraordinary pressure to quantify and report embedded carbon emissions across complex global supply chains, and spreadsheets and legacy tools simply can’t handle the work. By embedding in-product calculation within the enhanced CBAM solution, we’re empowering manufacturers and their suppliers to streamline data collection, automate emissions calculations, and confidently meet evolving regulatory demands. This marks a new standard in how primary emissions data is gathered and leveraged at scale.” The new solution includes foundational elements such as embedded regulatory expertise and multi-lingual supplier support, Assent said. The solution integrates technology from German-based company Forward Earth, a developer of AI-driven carbon management software, to deliver the in-product calculator, and an AI support feature to answer questions and guide suppliers through the carbon calculation process, the company added.

Speaking to global business leaders at the “Choose France” International Business Summit on Monday, Macron framed the elimination of the CSDDD as part of a major push to reduce regulatory and compliance burdens on companies to help improve competitiveness by creating a level playing field with the U.S., China and other companies. Macron said: “Clearly we are very aligned now with Chancellor Merz… CSDDD and some other regulations have to not just be postponed for one year, but to be put out of the table.” The CSDDD was initially proposed by the European Commission in February 2022, setting out obligations for companies to identify, assess, prevent, mitigate, address and remedy impacts on people and planet – ranging from child labor and slavery to pollution and emissions, deforestation and damage to ecosystems – in their upstream supply chain and some downstream activities such as distribution and recycling. The legislation was adopted in May 2024 , but only after a long process that ultimately required revisions in the legislation that significantly scaled back the number of companies covered by the law, and extended the timeline to its full implementation. One of the key factors that jeopardized the passage of the CSDDD legislation was a last minute effort by France to significantly scale back the scope of the new rules to apply only to companies with more than 5,000 employees, instead of the initially proposed 500 employee threshold, effectively removing roughly 80% of businesses from the CSDDD obligations. The legislation was passed with a new threshold of 1,000 employees. As part of the EU Commission’s Omnibus process launched in February 2025, aimed at significantly reducing the sustainability reporting and regulatory burden on companies, implementation of the CSDDD has been delayed by a year to 2028, and a series of changes to the directive have been proposed, including requiring full due diligence only at the level of direct business partners, reducing the frequency of monitoring the effectiveness of due diligence from annual to every 5 years, and limiting the amount of information that can be requested from small companies. In the leadup to the Omnibus, France had already called for “an indefinite postponement” of the implementation of the CSDDD. In his speech to business leaders, Macron made clear that he is calling not just to simplify the CSDDD, but to eliminate the law altogether. Macron said: “I’m not even speaking about the content. I’m just speaking about how to synchronize with the U.S. and the rest of the world.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Founded in 2019, Montreal-based Novisto provides sustainability data management and reporting software for global enterprises, with solutions aimed at enabling companies to collect quantitative and qualitative ESG data, manage sustainability information while adapting to changes in frameworks and standards, and streamline sustainability reporting. To date, Novisto has raised more than $55 million, including an $8 million Series A round in 2021, and a $20 million Series B in 2023. Novisto said that it has nearly tripled its revenue since the Series B round. According to Novisto, the new capital raise comes amidst a “huge market opportunity” driven by increased regulatory risk and uncertainty in Europe and North America, and a movement towards streamlining regulatory and reporting burdens on companies, such as the EU’s Omnibus proposals. The company said that the new capital will be used to enhance its sustainability platform, and to accelerate its presence in Europe, with an aim to build a team of equal size to its North American counterpart in Europe. Charles Assaf, CEO and Co-founder, Novisto, said: “We have seen that forward-thinking leaders are not waiting for full policy clarity to act on sustainability reporting and ESG compliance: they are acting now. The market demands it of a leading organisation, and it encourages transparent, accurate and decision-grade sustainability information. We see a huge and growing global opportunity in front of us, underpinned by our current momentum, and spearheaded by senior leaders at global companies who are committed to making their businesses more resilient and sustainable.” The Series C round was led by software-focused investor Inovia Capital, and included participation from all of Novisto’s previous investors including White Star Capital, SCOR Ventures, and Sagard. Inovia Principal, Mia Morisset, said: “Novisto is trusted by leading global enterprises, a testament to the strength of its best-in-class product. Since its Series B, we’ve had the opportunity to witness firsthand how Charles and his team have built a uniquely positioned solution for success. We look forward to continuing to support Novisto as it scales.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Sustainable investing is a broad discipline, covering multiple aspects of the investment process, from financing projects using sustainability-linked financial instruments, to risk avoidance by focusing on favorably ESG-rated companies, to proxy voting to influence the behavior of companies. Not surprisingly, as investor demand for sustainability-themed action has grown, this has often taken the form of pressure building on influential investment managers to push for change at the company level. Thus, in recent months, the market has seen investing giants like BlackRock and State Street publicly declare to actively embed sustainability considerations in their investment processes, including using proxy voting power to push for change, and to divest from companies that did not fit the requisite ESG profile. These are not simple decisions for the asset managers, who, as investment stewards, must first and foremost take their fiduciary duties to their clients into consideration, and align their activities with these considerations. Among the largest investment managers, Vanguard – a long-time champion of investment stewardship – has been one of the most circumspect regarding its approach to taking action on sustainability issues…until now. Vanguard has published a report outlining its expectations for companies and their boards regarding climate risk governance, and an accompanying report detailing examples of recent proxy voting positions the company has taken to support this position. The approach Vanguard describes is characteristically measured. Outlining the firm’s proxy voting process regarding climate-related shareholder proposals, Vanguard details a process of first determining the materiality of the risk the climate issue has on the company, and the scope of actions being presented in the proposals, with a preference given to increased disclosure and target setting. Vanguard describes the process as follows: “We carefully analyze every climate-related proposal. At companies where climate matters present material risks, the funds are likely to support shareholder proposals that seek reasonable and effective disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions or other climate-related metrics. The funds may also support proposals that ask companies to pursue climate risk mitigation targets, such as those aligned to the goals of the Paris Agreement. “The funds are unlikely to support proposals requiring companies to make specific operational changes, such as phasing out a business or product; we generally view such proposals as overly prescriptive.” The firm tends to avoid using the voting process to push for direct operational changes, preferring to use direct engagement to address these issues: “Vanguard has had a wider and deeper impact on climate-related matters through our direct engagements with portfolio companies. Last year, we spoke with more than 250 companies in carbon intensive industries. We also regularly talk about climate risk with companies beyond those in the top carbon-producing and carbon-consuming sectors. Few companies will be entirely insulated from the impacts of climate change.” Vanguard goes on to lay out its expectations for companies and their boards. First and foremost, the firm expects appropriate oversight by companies of climate risks, with proper disclosure that enables investor insight into company decision-making and management of climate-related risks and opportunities. At the board level, Vanguard expects long-term strategic considerations to take into account not only the physical risk aspect of climate change, but the transition risk as well, including regulatory changes, technological disruption and shifting consumer preferences. Vanguard appeals for “climate-competent” boards that include directors with relevant climate or business adaptation experience, seek diverse perspectives such as input from various geographies or sectors, and engage in ongoing education with experts, stakeholders and industry groups. Vanguard’s newly published guidelines for its stance on climate risk governance lays out a measured  approach that, on the surface, is less aggressive than its peers, but may ultimately may prove highly effective, one that seeks a path in line with its view of its fiduciary duties, while setting clear, specific expectations of company management and boards in addressing this growing and disruptive risk.

MIRA’s survey summarizes responses from 150 real asset investors, representing over $20 trillion of assets globally. Some of the key findings include an intensifying interest in sustainable investing, high conviction that an ESG strategy can improve returns, and some revealing regional differences in the resources and attention managers allocate to ESG. Greater focus on ESG The MIRA survey found that investors have been increasing\ntheir focus on ESG, and intend to continue to do so. 58% of investors report\nhaving increased their ESG focus over the past 5 years, while an impressive 91%\nexpect it to increase further over the next 5 years. Some investors expect a\nlong-term convergence between ESG and traditional investing, as explained by\none respondent to the survey: “There will be even less of a divide between “traditional” financial matters and ESG matters. They will become more entangled, with one key driver being the need to invest in, for example, climate change solutions and Sustainable Development Goal solutions.” Better returns with ESG Most survey respondents expressed their belief that\nincluding ESG considerations can boost investment performance, with 78% supporting\nthe proposition that having a good sustainability strategy improves returns,\nalthough 21% indicated that it can actually sacrifice returns. Despite this\nresult, almost two thirds of respondents indicated they are not yet using\nactive ESG assessment in their decision-making. Exclusion and Active ESG strategies Investors responding to the survey indicated the use of both\nexclusion strategies (such as avoiding specific companies or sectors) as well\nas active strategies (allocating funds to ESG-benefiting sectors). The most\ncommonly categories for exclusion included weapons and defence, Labor/human rights\nviolations, and environmental violations. The most common actively pursued ESG\nthemes are Renewable Energy, Environmental Impact, and Social Impact. Regional differences One of the most interesting findings revealed by the survey is\nthe contrast between regions in resources and attention firms allocate to ESG. 72%\nof respondents from EMEA and 71% from Australia reported having a dedicated ESG\nfunction in their firms, compared to only 24% of those in the Americas and 21%\nin Asia. Similarly, 74% of EMEA investors and 95% in Australia reported having\nan ESG policy, while only 48% in the Americas and 58% in Asia have one. ESG growth drivers MIRA’s survey revealed not only that ESG-driven investing is\ngrowing, but also uncovered several of the drivers of that growth. In the commentary\nsection of report discussing the survey findings, MIRA indicated that one of\nthe key reasons for the growth in ESG investing is the increased perception of\nrisk, with investors becoming increasingly conscious of their own reputations\nand brands, driving them to avoid controversial investments. Other drivers\ninclude the belief that sustainable investing improves returns, public policy\npromoting sustainability and improved ESG disclosure, as well as broader\ngeneral awareness of environmental, social and governance issues.

Last week, the company joined Climate Action 100+ , a network of investment managers dedicated to promote cleaner practices among large corporations. Subsequently, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink published a letter to CEOs focused on climate change and putting sustainability at the core of BlackRock’s investment process. We believe BlackRock’s new focus on sustainability marks the\nbeginning of a fundamental shift in the investment management universe, namely\nthe emergence of ESG as the most significant and pervasive investment theme of\nthe next decade. As Mr. Fink points out in his letter to CEOs, climate change\nwill have major implications on economic growth and prosperity, yet it is “a\nrisk that markets to date have been slower to reflect.” We believe this to be\ntrue not just of environmental stewardship, but of all ESG risks. ESG issues,\nfrom climate change, to rising pharmaceutical pricing, to workplace safety, are\nincreasingly front and center in media, politics, and social media… yet are all\nbut absent in the decision-making process of professional investment managers. But\nwe believe this is beginning to change. In our experience, this change takes place in several\nstages. First, professional investment managers become aware of the\nrelevance of ESG issues by catering to the requests of socially-conscious\nclients, who don’t want to be funding companies or projects that don’t align\nwith their values. Consider, for example, a charitable foundation that wants to\navoid owning fossil fuel-producing assets. From there, ESG awareness becomes a process of risk\nmanagement – such as avoiding companies that are more likely to suffer losses\ndue to weak governance, or with exposure to environmental fines. Finally, we believe that ESG investing will become an\ninvestment theme that portfolio managers will pursue actively – looking for\ncompanies that will benefit from these evolving trends. As stated in the\nBlackRock letter: “These questions are driving a profound reassessment of risk and asset values. And because capital markets pull future risk forward, we will see changes in capital allocation more quickly than we see changes to the climate itself. In the near future – and sooner than most anticipate – there will be a significant reallocation of capital .” As investors, we know that significant reallocation of\ncapital creates significant opportunities. We believe the best forward-looking\nmanagers will be able to use ESG strategies, not just to avoid risk, but to\ncreate superior long-term returns, making ESG investing one of the most powerful\ninvestment themes in the coming years.

For the report, the 2025 Gen Z and Millennial Survey, Deloitte surveyed more than 23,400 Gen Z (those born between 1995 – 2005) and millennial (born 1983 – 1994) respondents across North America, Latin America, Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Deloitte noted that Gen Zs and Millennials are anticipated to make up 74% of the global workforce by 2030. The survey found that purpose in the workplace is a major motivating factor for the Gen Z and Millennial workforce, with around 90% in each group reporting that a sense of purpose is important to their job satisfaction and well-being, with Deloitte noting that respondents in the study are seeking to balance a “trifecta” of money, meaning, and well-being in their careers. The study also found that respondents are increasingly concerned about the environment, with 65% of Gen Zs and 63% of Millennials reporting having felt worried about the environment in the past month, up several percentage points over a survey last year, and with less than 30% of each group reporting that they have not experienced extreme weather events in the past year. The survey suggested that the respondents’ environmental concerns and focus on purpose is influencing their career decisions and actions. According to the study, 70% of respondents reported that they consider a company’s environmental credentials or policies to be important when evaluating a potential employer, with around 23% reporting that they have already researched a company’s environmental credentials and policies before accepting a job, and 15% of Gen Zs and 13% of Millennials saying that they have already changed jobs due to concerns about environmental impact. Additionally, nearly half of respondents in each group (48% of Gen Z and 47% of Millennials) reported that they and their colleagues have put pressure on their employers to take action on protecting the environment. Similarly, Gen Zs and Millennials are also integrating sustainability considerations into their consumption decisions and behaviors, according to the study, which found that 65% of Gen Zs and 63% of Millennials reported being willing to pay more for environmentally sustainable products or services, and that around 25% have already conducted research on a company’s environmental impact or policies before buying a product or service from them. Additionally, many respondents reported taking action to reduce their environmental impact, with 43% of Gen Zs and 47% of Millennials saying they have taken steps to conserve water, and 36% saying they have started to take more energy efficient transportation instead of driving a car. Additionally, more than a quarter of respondents reported that they have upgraded their homes with more sustainable features such as solar panels or geothermal heating, and around 45% plan to do so in the future, and nearly half of each group said that they plan to purchase an electric vehicle or hybrid in the future.

The survey also identified confidence in returns as the top factor motivating investors to increase sustainable investment allocations, and found that investors have become less likely to believe that there is a tradeoff between sustainability and financial performance. Nearly 60% of investors said that they plan to increase allocations to sustainable investments over the next year, with only 3% planning to decrease. For the report, “Sustainable Signals – Individual Investors 2025,” Morgan Stanley surveyed 1,765 individual investors across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. The survey was conducted in February an March 2025. The survey found that interest in sustainable investing remains strong, with 88% of investors globally reporting that they are interested in sustainable investing, including over half stating that they are “very interested.” Interest levels were fairly consistent across regions, with 84% of North American investors reporting being interested in sustainable investing, compared with 88% of European investors and 92% of APAC investors. Notably, despite recent controversy and political pushback on ESG, the survey found that investor interest in sustainable investing has remained virtually unchanged, with a 2023 Morgan Stanely survey finding U.S. and European interest levels of 84% and 85%, respectively. The survey found that younger investors expressed much stronger interest in sustainable investing than their older counterparts, with 99% of Gen Z (age 18 – 28) and 97% of Millennial (age 29 – 44) investors reporting being interested in sustainable investing, including around 70% of each group reporting being “very interested.” Younger investors were also found to already be directing a substantially larger proportion of their portfolios to sustainable investments, with 68% of Gen Z and 65% of Millennials reporting having more than 20% of their portfolios currently invested in companies or investment funds that seek to make a positive social or environmental impact, compared with only 37% of Gen X and 22% of Baby Boomers. Overall, 59% of global investors reported that they plan to increase allocations to sustainable investments over the next year, with 31% planning to maintain allocations, and 3% planning to decrease. Notably, the survey found much stronger intentions by younger investors to direct an increasingly higher proportion of their portfolios to sustainable investments, with 80% of Gen Z and Millennials reporting plans to increase sustainable investment allocations, compared with 56% of Gen X and only 31% of Baby Boomer investors. Jessica Alsford, Chief Sustainability Officer and Chair of the Institute for Sustainable Investing at Morgan Stanley, said: “Younger investors plan to increase portfolio allocations to sustainable options at higher rates and prioritize a broader range of environmental and social issues when making investment decisions. This suggests that sustainability could become an even greater focus area for investors in the future as younger generations gain more financial influence.” The top reason reported by investors driving expected growth in sustainable investments was anticipated investment performance, with 24% of investors saying that they plan to increase allocations because they are more confident that sustainable options offer comparable or better returns. Additionally, a large majority of investors rejected the idea that there is a tradeoff between sustainability and financial performance, with 85% of respondents reporting that they believe that it is possible to balance financial gains with a focus on sustainability, with U.S. and European investors more likely to express this opinion than in the 2023 survey. Additionally, 84% of investors reported believing that funds can generate returns in line with the market alongside positive social or environmental outcomes. The survey also explored sustainable investment challenges facing investors, with greenwashing concerns reported as the top barrier to including sustainable investments in portfolios, followed by a lack of transparency and trust in reported data. Younger investors were more likely to report a lack of knowledge or advice as a barrier to sustainable investing. Accordingly, they were also much more likely to say that they would be likely to select a financial advisor or investment platform based on their sustainable investing offerings, at 96% of Gen Z and 92% of Millennials, compared to 76% of Gen Z and 52% of Boomers. Overall, the survey found that sustainability factors play a strong role in the investment process, with more than three quarters of investors globally saying that they would be likely to consider factors including a company’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gases, climate disclosures, or human rights policies and practices when making an investment. By sustainable investment theme, the survey found a strong interest in climate-related strategies, with over 80% reporting seeing the energy transition as an opportunity to generate returns. Additionally, over half of investors said that they would only invest in traditional energy companies if they had robust plans to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and address climate change, and 60% of companies saying that they would be somewhat (20%) or very (40%) likely to purchase carbon offsets for their investment portfolios. Alsford added: “Our Sustainable Signals survey shows that investors across demographic groups and regions continue to believe that investments can achieve both positive real-world outcomes and competitive market-rate returns.” Click here to access the survey.

For the report, the latest edition of the MSCI Transition Finance Tracker (re-named from the Net-Zero Tracker), MSCI assessed the climate change progress of companies within the MSCI All Country World Investable Market Index (ACWI IMI), and included data from its “Implied Temperature Rise” metric, across key themes including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, corporate targets, disclosure, financial flows, the energy transition, and physical risk and nature. The report found that as of March 2025, 60.1% of companies have published climate commitments, rising sharply from around 28% five years earlier, but remaining flat over 2024’s 60%. While the pace of commitment setting has slowed, the report found a sharp increase in ambition within companies’ climate goals, with the proportion of listed companies with a Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) validated target rising to 14.2% in 2025, up from only 9.3% in the prior year. Additionally, the proportion of companies with companywide net zero targets continued to climb, reaching 29.3% in 2025, up slightly from 28.9% a year earlier, and from only 4.5% in 2020. By sector, the report found that industrials had the highest share of SBTi-validated targets, at 21.5% of companies, followed by consumer discretionary at 15.5% and information technology at 13.9%, while the utilities sector had only 3%, and 0% of energy companies, as the SBTi does not currently validate targets from oil and gas companies. The report also indicated that companies have succeeded in decoupling growth from emissions, particularly in developed markets, where revenue of listed companies has increased by nearly 50% between 2015 and 2023, while those companies’ emissions declined by almost 25% over the same period. While emissions growth for emerging market companies roughly matched revenue growth from 2015 to 2020, revenues outpaced emissions after this period, and emissions declined in 2023 while revenues continued to increase. By region, direct Scope 1 emissions of listed companies in the U.S., Japan, Germany and UK fell from 2015 to 2023, with the U.S. among the strongest performers with a 10% decline, according to the report. By contrast, emissions by listed companies in China nearly doubled over the period, reflecting growth in industrial activity, while India increased as well. While the report revealed progress in climate target setting and emissions reduction by companies, it also indicated that most companies are not yet aligned with global climate goals. According to data from MSCI’s Implied Temperature Rise, the report found that only 12% of companies are currently aligned with limiting average global temperature rise to 1.5°C, and an additional 27% are aligned with warming between 1.5°C and 2°C, while the median alignment of companies is with 2.7°C. By country, companies in Germany were found to align with the lowest temperature rise, at 2°C, followed by France and the UK at 2.3°C each, while Saudi Arabia tops the list at 6.4°C, followed by China at 3.3°C.

For the quarterly report, Morningstar Sustainalytics analyzed activity in the global sustainable fund universe, which encompasses open-end funds and ETFs that, by prospectus or other regulatory filings, claim to focus on sustainability, impact, or environmental, social, and governance factors. Among the key factors highlighted by Morningstar driving the record withdrawal was the first-ever outflows in European funds to be recorded by the report since at least 2018, when the series began. European inflows have been offsetting U.S. outflows for the past 10 consecutive quarters. Overall, European sustainable funds experienced $1.2 billion in redemptions, with U.S. outflows reaching $6.1 billion in the quarter, according to the report. In the report, Morningstar said: “Up to last quarter, European sustainable funds had consistently attracted positive quarterly flows, including in the fourth quarter of 2023, when conventional funds experienced redemptions. In the past quarter, however, for the first time since at least 2018, European sustainable funds suffered outflows, in contrast with the strong inflows registered by their conventional peers.” The report highlighted several factors to explain the results, with the election of Donald Trump as a key driver, introducing legal risks for companies from the President’s anti-climate and anti-ESG agenda, leading asset managers to become more cautious in promoting ESG credentials and sustainable investment products. More broadly, the report noted that an increasingly complex geopolitical environment has shifted investors’ attention to economic growth, competitiveness, and defense, at the expense of deprioritizing sustainability concerns and climate goals. Morningstar also noted the evolving regulatory agenda and ESG fund landscape in Europe, as well as performance concerns, particularly in sectors such as clean energy, as weighing on investor sentiment. Despite the outflows, however, total global sustainable fund assets remained relatively unchanged in the quarter, ending Q1 2025 at $3.16 trillion, compared with $3.18 trillion in Q4 2024. Europe accounts for the bulk of sustainable fund assets at 84%, with the U.S. representing only around 10%. Sustainable fund launches declined as well, slumping to only 54 new sustainable funds introduced worldwide in the quarter, down from 105 in the prior quarter (although Morningstar indicated that it anticipates this figure will be revised higher as additional launches are identified). The report noted that the slowdown in launches reflects a normalization in product development after several years of high growth, as well as increased caution by asset managers around greenwashing concerns and evolving regulations. In addition to slower fund launches, the report also noted continued activity in sustainable fund rebranding, as asset managers deal with new and evolving regulations, including sustainable fund labeling rules such as the FCA’s SDR in the UK, and ESMA’s ESG fund naming guidelines in Europe, as well as the anticipated review of the EU’s SFDR regulation. The report found that fund rebranding reached a new high in Q1 2025, with around 335 funds with ESG-related terms in their names rebranding in the quarter, including 216 changing a sustainability-related term for another, 116 dropping ESG terms, and three adding ESG terms to their names. Notably, the report found that uptake of the new sustainability labels created under the FCA’s SDR regulation has been slow, with only 94 funds to date, accounting for 20% of UK-domiciled funds claiming sustainability characteristics, adopting one of the new labels. Hortense Bioy, Head of Sustainable Investing Research at Morningstar Sustainalytics, said: “The quarter signals a shift, not just in flows, but in how sustainable investment strategies are being perceived and positioned in the market. We’re seeing further signs of consolidation, rebranding activity, and cautious product development, amid an intensifying ESG backlash in the U.S. which is now also noticeably affecting sentiment in Europe. Investor appetite for ESG funds will continue to be tested in the months ahead by an evolving regulatory landscape and mounting geopolitical tensions.” Click here to access the report.

CDP runs a global environmental disclosure system, enabling investors and other stakeholders to measure and track organization’s performance in key environmental sustainability areas including climate, forests, and water security. In 2024, a record of more than 22,700 companies disclosed through CDP, up 8% over the prior year. Of these companies, nearly all (98%) received a climate score, while 6,500 received a water score, and 1,600 received a forests score. CDP awards “A” scores to companies that provide the most accurate picture of their environmental impact in each category, and are best equipped to take actions to mitigate their impacts. For the 2024 disclosure cycle, CDP reported that 515 companies achieved A List status, or 2% of all disclosing companies, up from 396 companies in 2023. By category, 462 companies were awarded A scores for Climate, up by 33%, and 133 companies received A scores for Water Security, up 32%, while the number of companies on the Forests A List fell slightly to 26, from 30 in the prior year. With the annual results, CDP also released research indicating that A List companies outperform their peers, with analysis showing an average of 6% higher stock returns over the past decade. According to CDP, only 8 companies achieved a “Triple A” in 2024, reaching top scores in each environmental category. Triple A companies included L’Oréal, Kering, British American Tobacco, KAO Corporation, Uni-Charm Corporation, Toyota Tsusho Corporation, Metsä Board Corporation, and Marfrig Global Foods S/A. By region, CDP reported that for climate and water, Asia had the most A List companies followed by Europe and the Americas, while Europe had the most A List companies for forests, followed by Asia and the Americas. CDP Sherry Madera said: “Thank you to all of you who disclosed through CDP. You are championing transparency and good governance. Congratulations to the 2024 A List – representing every major sector with disclosures across climate, water and forests topics. These business leaders know something important: Earth-positive action drives opportunity and growth.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The study also found that the practice of setting climate goals is progressing down the value chain as companies increase engagement efforts, with smaller companies representing a growing proportion of those introducing new targets. For the report, PwC’s 2025 State of Decarbonization, PwC examined data from 4,163 public companies that submitted the full CDP questionnaire in the 2024 disclosure cycle, using GenAI to analyze more than 1 million entries of long form free text and quantitative responses, in addition to drawing on information from S&P Capital IQ, the Science-Based Targets initiative, and various public sources of information. The report found that, while headlines suggest that companies are scaling back their sustainability efforts, 47% of companies maintained their decarbonization targets in 2024, and 37% actually increased their ambitions, while only 16% pulled back on their climate goals. Even among those scaling back, PwC found that more than half are recalibrating their expectations lower from overly ambitious goals set in the absence of a detailed plan, as companies gain a better view of what it achievable. According to the report, the number of companies setting new Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets has grown for each of the past seven years, including growing by 14% in 2024 to 1,293 companies from 1,132 in 2023, and up from less than 500 companies in 2020. Notably, however, the total emissions covered by the new targets declined in 2024 to around 1.1 billion metric tons of CO2e from more than 2 billion tons in the prior year. PwC attributed the change to a major shift in smaller companies setting climate goals, with the average revenue for a company introducing new goals in 2024 declining to $1.3 billion from $3.8 billion in 2020. The increase in participation by smaller companies in setting climate commitments comes as companies appear to be ramping engagement in order to tackle their Scope 3 value chain emissions, with 72% of companies reporting that they are now engaging with their suppliers, and 67% engaging with customers and clients. The value chain focus was also apparent in disclosure data, with more than 3,600 companies reporting Scope 3 emissions in 2024, up by 80% from around 2,000 in the prior year. Despite the increased focus on engagement and reporting, the report found that only 54% of companies were on track to meet their Scope 3 emissions goals. Notably, however, this metric improved from 50% in 2023. The report found a better success rate on operational and energy emissions, with 67% of companies on track to meet their Scope 1 and 2 targets. Progress appears to be much faster on Scope 2, with on-track companies reporting an aggregate reduction of 12%, compared to a 6% reduction in Scope 1 emissions. According to PwC, the faster progress on Scope 2 emissions highlights the centrality of low-carbon electricity to current emissions reduction efforts, with a shift to renewable energy accounting for more than 40% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions reductions last year, indicating a need to focus in the future on direct Scope 1 emissions in the future to maintain momentum. As companies increasingly set decarbonization commitments, the report also found that they anticipate spending more on climate initiatives, with expectations for an 18% higher proportion of capex and 21% higher proportion of operating expenses to be allocated to climate mitigation and adaptation by 2030. The higher spending expectations come as companies also see opportunities to add value through their climate efforts, with 60% of companies already having low-carbon products in their portfolio, and PwC’s analysis finding a potential uplift of 6% to 25% from products featuring sustainability attributes. PwC also highlighted potential value to be derived from progress on Scope 3 emissions, with less energy and materials needed to produce products translating to lower costs and improved margins.

For the report, the organizations surveyed 320 senior professionals, including 75% at the C-Suite, Director, and Management levels, across a wide range of sectors and regions. The report follows a similar survey released in early 2024 by Salesforce and Globescan. The survey found that two thirds of executives reported that sustainability is “very important” to their companies’ commercial success, up slightly from last year, with executives highlighting a wide range of value creation drivers. The top benefits reported included enhanced brand and reputation, cited by 74% of respondents, followed by stronger stakeholder and community relations at 70%. The business leaders also cited key operational benefits from sustainability actions, including employee attraction and retention reported by 61%, growing sales by 49%, and increased efficiency and reduced costs by 50%. Additionally, 56% of respondents said that sustainability actions helped drive supply chain resiliency, up from only 44% last year. Despite the perceived benefits, however, only 37% of respondents reported that sustainability is “very integrated” into their companies’ core business strategies, remaining flat with last year’s survey. Notably, these “Advanced Integrators” were much more likely to report benefits from their sustainability actions across all categories, with 67% citing growing sales, 65% increasing efficiencies and reducing costs, and 70% reporting improved employee attraction and retention. Advanced Integrators were also more likely to report that mandatory sustainability reporting is driving value creation opportunities, compared with 39% of other respondents. Overall, 44% of respondents said that mandatory sustainability reporting is driving collaboration supporting value creation opportunities, with another 35% citing only compliance benefits. By function, finance leaders were the most likely to cite value creation opportunities from mandatory sustainability reporting at 61%, compared with 45% of IT execs, and only 39% of sustainability professionals. Finance and technology were seen as the key functions within within organizations for sustainability progress, cited by 77% and 76% of respondents, respectively, as important. Within these functions, 61% of finance leaders and 46% of IT said that sustainability considerations ranked “high” or “very high” in their decision-making. Despite the centrality of finance and technology to sustainability actions, however, respondents reported low levels of confidence in their sustainability skills, with only 32% of finance leaders and 23% of IT reporting “high” or “very high” sustainability understanding. The report found that only around 30% of companies have access to high quality sustainability data, up slightly from 27% last year. Notably, Advanced Integrators were much more likely, at 50%, to report having high quality sustainability data, compared with only 18% of other companies. The report also found that while very few executives are currently seeing strong sustainability benefits from AI, although many expect this to improve in the near future. Only 6% of respondents said that AI has already delivered significant value for sustainability, while 50% anticipate that AI will become more valuable for sustainability over the next 2 years.

In addition to reaching this milestone, the company has introduced additional sustainability goals in its new Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Vision for 2030 publication. N. R. Narayana Murthy, Founder – Infosys, said: “Longevity and success for a company comes from living in harmony with the context in which it operates. Right from the first day, Infosys has recognized and fulfilled its responsibilities towards overcoming the challenges in our context. It has also taken on new responsibilities like reducing carbon emission, improving air quality, optimally using water and solar power. The Infosys Foundation has helped the poor by addressing their needs in education, healthcare, nutrition and shelter as well as providing shoulder to the efforts of our governments during times of disaster. Today, nearly four decades after embracing these values, I am happy that Infosys continues to strive hard for these values to make our context better.” According to Infosys, the company began taking climate action in 2008, and set out its goal for carbon neutrality in 2011. Since 2008, the company has reduced its per capita electricity consumption by over 55%, and 44% of the company’s electricity across its India operations is now derived from renewable sources. For its remaining carbon footprint, Infosys has used an equivalent volume of offsets to reach net zero emissions in 2020. According to the company, it has developed a portfolio of community-based carbon offset projects, focused primarily on socio-economic development of rural communities and contributions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The projects not only address climate change, but also benefit over 100,000 rural families. Nandan Nilekani, Co-founder and Chairman, Infosys, said: “Infosys has always balanced success as a business with unwavering focus on exemplary governance and responsiveness to the needs of the ecology and society. As an early proponent of responsible business, we understand our obligation to integrate ESG factors into what we do, which is only increasing in importance particularly in the wake of COVID-19.  Our company began to take action to combat climate change in 2008 and I am delighted to announce Infosys’ carbon neutrality in 2020. Today, our 2030 vision reflects how ESG will continue to be integral to Infosys’ sustainable business performance.” Infosys’ ESG 2030 Vision lays out a series of the company’s sustainability commitments across environmental, social and governance aspects. The company’s 2030 goals include reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by a further 75% (2020 base year) and Scope 3 by 30%, reducing its water footprint, creating a gender diverse workforce with 45% women, extending digital skills to 10 million people by 2025, adopting leading data privacy standards, and ensuring robust compliance and integrity practices, among others. Salil Parekh, Chief Executive Officer, Infosys, said: “As a progressive business committed to the well-being of stakeholders, Infosys is incredibly proud of the investments its founders have made to make the business truly sustainable and socially responsible. The company’s ESG roadmap for 2030 reflects its continued aspiration to be a well-governed model organization for diverse talent with an inclusive workplace and community strategies to leverage technology for good.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

    "content": "Microsoft Buys Over 600,000 Tons of Green Cement to Help Build Sustainable Materials Market - ESG Today ESG Investing, sustainable finance & business sustainability news ESG investing news, analysis, research and information Top Stories ESG News Companies Government Investors Regulators Sustainable Finance ESG Solutions ESG Tools, Services Companies Companies Investors Investors ESG Disclosure ESG Reporting Analysis Regulators Reports, Studies Newsfeed Resources Events About About us Our Team Advertise With Us Companies / Environment Microsoft Buys Over 600,000 Tons of Green Cement to Help Build Sustainable Materials Market ESG Today Writing Staff May 28, 2025 Microsoft announced that it has signed an agreement with Sublime Systems to buy more than 600,000 tons of low-carbon cement, with the purchase agreement aimed at helping the technology giant address its carbon footprint, as well as to help advance the sustainable materials market. Cement production is a significant contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions, and one of the more difficult sectors to decarbonize. Cement currently accounts for approximately 8% of global carbon dioxide emissions, with over 900 kg of CO2 emissions generated for every 1,000 kg of material produced. Spun out of MIT in 2020, Sublime has developed a proprietary process that utilizes an electrolyzer to produce cement at ambient temperatures, replacing energy and fossil fuel-intensive kilns, and enabling the use of calcium sources as an input material, avoiding the release of CO2 from limestone input. As part of the process, limestone, commonly used to make the cement, is converted to lime at room temperature, with the CO2 produced during this conversion process easier to capture. According to Microsoft, the new agreement, which will allow for the deployment of up to 622,500 metric tons of cement produced at Sublime’s first commercial factory and subsequent full-scale factory over six to nine years, reflects the tech giant’s strategy to use initiatives like this to help build markets for clean tech and sustainability solutions. The agreement allows Microsoft to purchase Sublime cement for construction projects when geographically possible. In addition, Microsoft will be able to purchase the environmental attribute certificates (EACs) of Sublime cement separately from the physical material—a similar mechanism to decoupling renewable energy certificates from the use of the actual energy produced. Jeff Leeper, Vice President of Global Datacenter Construction at Microsoft, said: “In designing creative transactions such as this one with Sublime, Microsoft aims to accelerate the mass production and adoption of clean construction materials, enabling innovators to overcome the real, acute challenges of scaling in heavy industries with existing manufacturing capacity. We need breakthrough, reimagined products like Sublime Cement at scale to reduce emissions—both at Microsoft and globally.” Sublime said that the agreement, especially the option for Microsoft to buy EACs, will help accelerate the opening of its first commercial factory and scale its production. The company’s technology more efficiently breaks down rock and other feedstocks into cement, avoiding the pollution and waste that have characterized cement manufacturing for over 200 years while reducing energy use. Dr. Leah Ellis, Sublime Systems CEO and Co-founder, said: “This purchase enables Microsoft to access Sublime’s low-carbon cement technology regardless of where their construction is. This solves a previously intractable challenge for clean cement scale-up: the lack of long-term cement transactions contrasted with the immediate need for innovators to demonstrate bankable customers to fund their manufacturing. Microsoft is stepping up as the first customer for our future megaton-scale plant, enabling us to more rapidly build and scale Sublime Cement as a global, enduring solution for clean construction.” The agreement forms part of a series of actions by Microsoft to address the embodied carbon of its built environment. Last year, the company announced that it would pioneer the use of wood in datacenter construction to replace steel and concrete, in addition to initiatives including updating contract language to include low-carbon requirements for materials and equipment used in datacenter construction, and investments in low-carbon building materials technologies and developers, such as Stegra (formerly H2 Green Steel), Boston Metal , CarbonCure , and Prometheus Materials through the Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund (CIF). In a blog post announcing the new agreement, Katie Ross, Director, Carbon Reduction Strategy & Market Development at Microsoft said: “Buying and using existing low-carbon materials builds the market for existing solutions, while unlocking financing through EACs and CIF ensures new production capacity for low-carbon materials. Together, this approach to building new markets creates a flywheel effect to signal demand, grow supply, and drive down costs and risk over time.” ESG Today Writing Staff Related Posts Companies / Honeywell, Johnson Matthey, GIDARA and Samsung Launch Alliance to Accelerate, Reduce Cost of SAF Production Environment / Nippon Steel to Invest $6 Billion to Decarbonize Steelmaking Companies / Infosys Sets New Goal to Remove More Carbon than it Emits by 2030 ‹ Schneider Electric Appoints Julien Picaud to Lead New Agentic AI Sustainability Ecosystem Initiative › Hitachi Raises Climate Ambition to Net Zero Across Value Chain by 2050 ESG Today Newsletter – Subscribe Subscribe to the ESG Today Newsletter Join our mailing list for the latest breaking ESG investment news!

The rollout of the cup begins this month in 10 European countries, and is set to come to the UK and Ireland later this year, Starbucks said. The new cup solves the challenges related to the sustainable disposal of current cups, which feature a plastic lining that needs to be separated from the rest of the cup before it can be recycled or composted. The new cups contain a mineral-based coating, and the lids are made from fibre alternatives, rather than plastic, and coated with the same mineral-based material. Duncan Moir, President of Starbucks EMEA, said: “Our hot cup solution is the first introduction of this emerging technology applied to a coffee cup at scale. Starbucks’ new hot cup in Europe provides a widely recyclable and home compostable alternative for when customers don’t have a reusable cup. I am really proud of the team that has worked to develop this innovative solution, and I am so excited to see it in the hands of our customers in Europe as they enjoy their coffee. We are keen to learn more from this rollout and remain focused on introducing more sustainable innovations to meet the shifting requirements of markets worldwide.” The new mineral-based coating is produced by Italy-based Qwarzo, providing a waterproof barrier that is recyclable and home compostable. The cup’s paper is provided by Finland’s Metsä Board,and is made from traceable wood fibre from Northern European forests.  Transcend Packaging, based in Wales, will manufacture the cup. Lorenzo Angelucci, CEO of Transcend Packaging, said: “Starbucks and the Europe go-to-market commitment it has made in this new technology allows us to demonstrate the transformative potential of the packaging solution we have developed. We welcome Starbucks’ courage in innovation to redesign and totally transform its packaging production processes, creating a premium new product while removing the plastic lining in coffee cups and swapping to fibre lids.” As part of its commitment to become a “resource positive” company, Starbucks has followed strategies including shifting away from single-use packaging and to promote recycling and reuse of waste. In 2022, the company announced plans to provide its customers globally with reusable cup options, with a 2025 goal for customers globally to have access to a reusable cup option for every visit. Starbucks said that it continues to operate a reusables-first approach across its stores, which includes rewarding customers who bring their own reusable cup with discounts and providing in-store ceramic offerings for hot drinks in the majority of its European locations.

According to the company, the announcement marks the largest seed round to date for climate tech in India. Founded in 2023 by brothers Shrey and Sparsh Agarwal, Alt Carbon has set a goal to remove 5 million metric tons of CO2 by 2030, with a focus on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) in South Asia, through technology pathways like Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW). The company’s ERW method sources basalt rock dust from mines, and spreads it across agricultural fields, where it reacts naturally with rainwater through a chemical reaction that converts it into stable bicarbonate ions that are stored in the soil, and over time travel through rivers to the ocean, residing as calcium carbonate for over 10,000 years. In addition to removing carbon, the process also improves soil health and crop yields, according to Alt Carbon. The company said that its flagship initiative, The Darjeeling Revival Project (DRP), aims to remove CO2 and to “restore livelihoods, revive degraded soils and ecosystems, and preserve India’s most valued export: Darjeeling’s tea.” In the past two months, Alt Carbon has signed a strategic partnership with Mitsubishi Corporation, and a 10,000-tonne carbon removal offtake agreement with MOL Group. Alt Carbon said that the new capital will help expand Earth Sciences R&D, advance hardware innovations, and scale-up operations for durable climate action in India, accelerating CDR in the Global South. Alt Carbon Co-founder & President, Sparsh Agarwal, said: “Our goal is to make India a hub for carbon removal. We plan to remove CO2 at scale from the Global South, for the planet. We thank the partners who have joined us in this ambitious, whirlwind journey, to revive Darjeeling, remove CO2 and undo the clock for this planet.” The seed round was led by tech investor and AI startup Physical Intelligence co-founder and CEO Lachy Groom, and included participation from existing investors. Groom said: “Alt Carbon is tackling a once-in-a-generation challenge. The personal journey of the founders, their technical approach, and ambitious vision will help us remove CO₂ from the atmosphere at gigaton scale — all while adapting agricultural land for climate impact. In just 18 months, the team has built a world-class lab, created proprietary models, and laid the foundation for a new class of carbon removal and agricultural infrastructure. This is a category-defining deep-tech company that will reshape how the world thinks about climate action.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The CSRD is a major update to the EU’s Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD), the previous EU sustainability reporting framework, significantly expanding the number of companies required to provide sustainability disclosures to over 50,000 from around 12,000. Based on new underlying European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), the CSRD introduces more detailed reporting requirements on company impacts on the environment, human rights and social standards and sustainability-related risk. The CSRD took effect from the beginning of 2024 for large public-interest companies with over 500 employees, with the first reports to be issued in 2025, followed by companies with more than 250 employees or €40 million in revenue in the following year, and listed SMEs one year later. According to the Commission, the new FAQ reflects input received from companies, and is intended to help reduce the administrative burden on companies, providing greater clarity and certainty, with a goal to “facilitate the compliance of stakeholders with the regulatory requirements in a cost-effective way and to ensure the usability and comparability of the reported information on sustainability. Key topics covered by the FAQ include the scope of the rules, determination of company size categories for compliance dates, exemptions, which sets of ESRS to use, considerations to take into account for the use of estimates if companies are not able to obtain value chain information, in addition to the sustainability information requests SMEs should expect to receive as a result of the CSRD. The FAQ also covers auditing and assurance-related issues, such as approval and training requirements for auditors, and accreditation requirements for independent assurance providers. Mairead McGuinness, Commissioner for Financial Services, Financial Stability and Capital Markets Union, said: “The EU has taken major steps in building a comprehensive sustainable finance framework over the past six years, encouraging companies to embark on their transition paths. Our focus now is to ensure that our tools are usable and effective, while continuing to reduce the administrative burden on companies.” Click here to access the FAQs.

The statement, made by Merz during a press conference alongside European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in his first visit to Brussels as Chancellor, follows a coalition agreement to form a government in Germany in April that included eliminating Germany’s own human rights and environmental supply chain due diligence law, the Supply Chain Act (LkSG). As part of the coalition agreement, though, the LkSG was to be replaced with the EU’s CSDDD law. Merz said: “We will revoke the national law in Germany, and I also expect the European Union to follow suit and really cancel this directive.” The CSDDD sets out obligations for companies to identify, assess, prevent, mitigate, address and remedy impacts on people and planet – ranging from child labor and slavery to pollution and emissions, deforestation and damage to ecosystems – in their upstream supply chain and some downstream activities such as distribution and recycling. The legislation was adopted in May 2024 , but only after a long process that ultimately required revisions in the legislation that significantly scaled back the number of companies covered by the law, and extended the timeline to its full implementation. In February, the EU Commission proposed changes to the CSDDD as part of its omnibus process to simplify compliance obligations and reduce reporting requirements for companies. Proposed changes included requiring full due diligence only at the level of direct business partners, unless the company has plausible information of adverse impacts further down the value chain, and reducing the frequency of monitoring the effectiveness of due diligence from annual to every 5 years, in addition to setting limits on the information that can be requested from small companies in the value chain. EU Lawmakers recently agreed to delay the implementation of the CSDDD by a year to 2028 as the omnibus process to update the law progresses. While welcoming the postponement of the sustainability regulations as “a first step,” Merz called for the “complete repeal of some directives” as “the next logical step,” adding: “I always like to mention the CSDDD in this context.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

India has set a series of climate goals, including a target to achieve net zero emissions by 2070, and an interim target to reduce emissions intensity of its economy by 45% by 2030. Additionally, India has set an ambition to transition to approximately 50% electric power from non-fossil-based sources by 2030. According to the Ministry of Finance, reaching India’s 2030 climate goal will require approximately $2.5 trillion of investment. In a statement announcing the release of the new framework, the ministry said that the Taxonomy is being designed with an objective to “facilitate greater resource flow to climate-friendly technologies and activities, enabling the country to achieve the vision of being Net Zero by 2070 while also ensuring long-term access to reliable and affordable energy.” India’s taxonomy mark the latest in a series of initiatives across jurisdictions to set up a classification system for the definition of sustainable economic activities, including taxonomy systems already established or in development in the EU , UK , Singapore , Hong Kong, Canada , and Australia . The new proposed Taxonomy will classify activities and projects by two categories, including “climate-supportive,” indicating that the activity contributes to specific objectives such as avoiding or reducing emissions, deploying adaptation activities to reduce climate change impacts, and R&D to meet these objectives, and; “transition supportive,” for projects that improve energy efficiency or reduce emissions intensity in sectors where absolute emissions avoidance is not yet viable. At launch, the taxonomy aims to hard-to-abate sectors such as Iron, Steel and Cement, sectors with climate mitigation and adaptation co-benefits including Power, Mobility and Buildings, and key climate adaptation and resilience-building sectors including Agriculture, food and water security. The proposed framework, setting out the rationale, objectives, principles and approach governing the classification of activities will form part of the new Taxonomy, alongside sector-specific annexes, which will specify measures, activities, and projects considered climate-supportive and those promoting the transition. The Ministry of Finance launched a consultation on the new draft Taxonomy framework, which will remain open for comments until June 25, 2025. Click here to access the draft.

Founded in 2000, CDP runs a global environmental disclosure system, enabling investors and other stakeholders to measure and track organization’s performance in key environmental sustainability areas including climate, forests, and water security. In 2024, a record of more than 22,700 companies disclosed through CDP, up 8% over the prior year. The restructuring comes as CDP faces economic challenges, requiring it to reduce its cost base and adjust staffing levels, with the organization saying that the move aims to “support a leaner, technology and partner-enabled CDP.” CDP added that it will look to strengthen key capabilities, including in new functions across Product, Growth, Operations and Customer Success, and that it will direct more resources toward innovation and impact, reinvesting in associated skills and expertise. CDP CEO Sherry Madera said: “The restructure announced today will enable CDP to invest in the resilience and innovation of tomorrow – reflecting our commitment to our partners and stakeholders across the ecosystem. We are relied upon to deliver consistent, comparable data that enables faster, smarter decisions – for sustainable business and the wider economy. We proudly support organizations to take action that protects the planet – and the bottom line.” Alongside the restructuring, CDP unveiled an updated strategy, with streamlining disclosure as a key focus area, including by reducing burden, duplication of efforts and manual data entry. Other key aims of the strategy include employing a use-case model to deliver decision-useful, sector-specific, actionable insights, and to “improve the provisioning and interoperable access of high-quality, standard-aligned data to the financial markets, requesting bodies, policy makers and the general public.” Madera added: “We remain focused on our mission, our partners and our people – supporting a whole of economy approach to planet and profit. It is with deep gratitude that we thank our CDP team and recognize their valuable contributions in pursuit of our bold vision.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The Biden administration had put in place legislation directing hundreds of billions of dollars to accelerate the energy transition in the U.S. and to help meet climate goals put in place by the administration. Most notably, the Inflation Reduction Act , signed into law by President Biden in 2022, allocated nearly $270 billion through a series of tax credits, loans, grants and subsidies to areas including renewable energy and industrial decarbonization solutions. President Trump has pledged to reverse Biden’s energy transition policy’s, including announcing the U.S.’ exit from the Paris Agreement on his first day in office, and also referencing plans to “end the Green New Deal,” likely a reference to the Inflation Reduction Act. Key energy transition focused proposals presented in the Republican tax plan include terminating a $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit at the end of 2025 except for vehicles produced by manufacturers that have not sold 200,000 new clean vehicles, and a $4,000 tax credit for previously-owned clean vehicles, as well as a tax credit for up to $40,000 for large commercial clean vehicles. The proposal would also eliminate tax credits at the end of 2025 for household energy efficiency improvements and for residential expenditures on renewable energy including solar electric property, solar water heating property, fuel cell property, small wind energy property, geothermal heat pump property, and battery storage property. Additionally, the package would phase out tax credits for the production of or investment in zero emissions electricity, beginning with a 20% reduction in 2029, and full elimination in 2031, and would also end a tax credit for the production or use of clean hydrogen. Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith said: “Under the economic policies of President Biden and Washington Democrats, the wealthy and well-connected benefitted from taxpayer handouts. The Ways and Means Republican tax bill ends special interest giveaways and will hold the woke elite and entities that benefit from the tax code accountable.” Sustainability-focused groups criticized the new proposals, warning that the elimination of the tax incentives will increase energy costs for consumers and slow the development of new energy sources. In a statement following the release of the tax plan, Rich Powell, CEO of the Clean Energy Buyers Association said: “Preserving the federal technology-neutral energy tax credits is crucial for supplying the energy needed to serve the 21st century industries of the United States and to drive American innovation and energy dominance.  As electricity demand rapidly increases now and in the years ahead, we need more options, not less. Moreover, some of America’s largest companies are attempting to advance critical new technologies like geothermal and advanced nuclear energy, but those technologies will not move forward if these tax credits are phased out.

Fuel accounts for the vast majority of the aviation sector’s emissions. Generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues, SAF is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry in the near- to medium-term. SAF producers estimate the fuels can result in lifecycle GHG emissions reductions of as much as 85% relative to conventional fuels. Efforts to meaningfully increase the use of SAF by airlines face significant challenges, including the low supply currently available on the market, and prices currently well above those of conventional fossil-based fuels. Although SAF usage needs to vastly increase, the growing cost to airlines is proving to be an obstacle, according to the IATA. Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director General, said: “While it is encouraging that SAF production is expected to double to two million tonnes in 2025, that is just 0.7% of aviation’s total fuel needs. And even that relatively small amount will add $4.4 billion globally to the fuel bill. The pace of progress in ramping up production and gaining efficiencies to reduce costs must accelerate.” Both the EU and UK’s SAF-focused mandates went live on 1 January. In Europe, this resulted in the cost of SAFs doubling, due to the associated compliance fees implemented by SAF producers and suppliers. For the expected one million tonnes of SAF purchases required to meet European mandates in 2025, the expected cost at current market prices is $1.2 billion, with compliance costs estimated to add an additional $1.7 billion on top of market prices, according to the IATA. Walsh continued: “This highlights the problem with the implementation of mandates before there are sufficient market conditions and before safeguards are in place against unreasonable market practices that raise the cost of decarbonization. Raising the cost of the energy transition that is already estimated to be a staggering $4.7 trillion should not be the aim or the result of decarbonization policies. Europe needs to realize that its approach is not working and find another way.” The IATA has urged governments to create more effective policies that support clean energy production – like SAFs – while decreasing support for fossil fuels, while also ensuring the success of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) by making Eligible Emissions Units (EEUs) available to airlines. CORSIA was launched by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016 to address carbon emissions from international flights. To support the global development of SAF, the IATA previously launched a SAF registry , which is managed by the Civil Aviation Decarbonization Organization (CADO). It introduced a more transparent and standardized system for tracking SAF purchases, usage and associated emissions reductions in line with existing regulations, such as the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS). In addition, the IATA’s SAF Matchmaker aims to facilitate SAF procurement by aligning airline SAF requests with suppliers.

Revera will develop, build, own, and operate energy infrastructure projects involving battery storage, renewable power, and green hydrogen. The projects will include those in Carlyle’s current portfolio, comprised of projects carved out and acquired from Amp Energy in Australia and the UK. Carlyle announced an initial $374 million investment in Amp Energy in 2021, and to date has invested more than $440 million in Amp’s global energy transition platform. Projects already underway by the platform in Australia include a 250 MW in-construction battery storage project, along with 3.7 GW of wind and solar prjoects, and a 1GW green hydrogen project, in addition to a development pipeline of more than 750MW of battery storage. In the UK, Revera is advancing more than 1.2GW of late-stage battery storage projects designed to strengthen grid resiliency and support national decarbonization goals. Richard Hoskins, Chairman of Revera Energy and Managing Director in Carlyle’s Infrastructure Group, said: “We are excited about the launch of Revera Energy and believe it marks a new growth phase for the platform’s dedicated staff and leadership team,and strengthens existing project commitments. We plan to leverage the expertise and resources of Carlyle’s global infrastructure platform to help accelerate Revera’s growth and to expand its portfolio of diversified energy projects.” In addition to financial backing from Carlyle, the firm said that the new platform will also benefit from existing relationships with financing partners including Nomura Infrastructure & Power, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac Institutional Bank, Natixis CIB, and Export Development Canada. Alain Halimi, Managing Director at Nomura IPB, said: “We are excited to support Revera Energy, as it brings together innovative energy solutions under Carlyle’s ownership. Revera has been very successful in developing a diverse development pipeline, which will support grid resiliency and energy transition goals across multiple jurisdictions.” The announcement follows the launch by Carlyle of renewable energy development platform Telis Energy in 2022, focused on high-quality renewable energy projects, with a focus on solar, in the UK, France, Spain, and Germany, and with a target project pipeline of more than 10GW in place by 2030.

Patria said that the new platform will initially focus on 100+ MW campus projects, tailored to high-density AI workloads, with expected investments above $1 billion. The launch of the new platform comes as demand for sustainability in data centers is growing, as the rapid growth of AI threatens to challenge global carbon emissions reduction efforts. The IEA estimates that AI-driven data center power usage could double by 2026 and expand rapidly over the next several years. Several tech giants, including Microsoft , Google and Amazon , have highlighted increased energy needs to meet the AI-driven growth in data centers as a key challenge to their decarbonization goals. Rodrigo Abreu, Digital Infrastructure Operating Partner at Patria Investments and CEO of Omnia, said: “The launch of Omnia marks an important moment for Patria. We believe Latin America is perfectly positioned to support the growth of the global AI data center infrastructure, with its vast potential of renewable energy at competitive cost, developed fiber connectivity, geopolitical neutrality and friendly regulatory environment for the development of new data center projects, allowing hyperscalers to rapidly expand their offerings while maintaining their ambitious environmental commitments.” According to Patria, the new platform’s data center projects are being developed to use 100% of energy needs from green, renewable sources, with minimal water usage for cooling and reduced environmental footprints, supporting long-term commitments and hyperscalers’ carbon neutrality goals. Omnia expects to start construction of its first data center campus in Brazil, in the second half of 2025. Felipe Pinto, Managing Partner of Patria’s Infrastructure Investments in Latin America, said: “Global demand for data centers is expected to more than double by 2030, driven by the widespread adoption of AI and the continued migration to cloud. In this context, Latin America’s capacity is forecast to more than triple over the coming years, requiring up to USD 50 billion in new capital investment. With the support of Patria’s track record and expertise in Energy, Data Centers and Real Estate, we believe Omnia has great potential ahead of it.” ESG Today Writing Staff Related Posts Energy Transition / Honeywell, Johnson Matthey, GIDARA and Samsung Launch Alliance to Accelerate, Reduce Cost of SAF Production Private Equity & Venture Capital / Google Backs TAE Technologies to Help Commercialize Fusion Energy Energy Transition / Nippon Steel to Invest $6 Billion to Decarbonize Steelmaking ‹ Tikehau Acquires Sustainable Mobility Solutions Provider EYSA › Neot Raises $390 Million to Launch New Sustainable Mobility Financing Platform ESG Today Newsletter – Subscribe Subscribe to the ESG Today Newsletter Join our mailing list for the latest breaking ESG investment news!

Inter IKEA Group is the group of companies that connects IKEA franchisees with range development and suppliers, and is responsible for aligning the overall IKEA strategic direction. Julle has been with IKEA for over 30 years, and has been serving as Acting CSO since September 2024, and as Sustainability Manager IKEA Of Sweden since 2021. The company said that in her new role, she will continue to lead and contribute to IKEA’s goal of developing more sustainable products and solutions for the international furniture and household goods market. Jon Abrahamsson Ring, CEO of Inter IKEA Group, said: “With her leadership and deep knowledge of IKEA, Lena has continued our journey to make IKEA more sustainable in everything we do. As Acting Chief Sustainability Officer, she’s already made strong contributions in our journey towards net zero and further developed the overall IKEA sustainability agenda. I look forward to working together with her to make our commitments a reality.” Among IKEA Group’s sustainability goals is achieving net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in sourcing and extraction of raw materials, food ingredients, as well as in manufacturing, product transport, retail operations, customer travel to stores, product use in customers’ homes and product end-of-life. The company said it hopes to achieve these goals by 2050 at the latest. Julle said: “The IKEA goal – to be more affordable, accessible, and sustainable, especially for those with limited budgets – resonates deeply with me since I began my journey at IKEA. Creating smart, well-designed, functional products for everyday use at home, based on our life-at-home expertise, while making steady progress on our sustainability agenda, presents a tremendous opportunity. I look forward to continuing to work closely with my passionate IKEA colleagues to inspire and enable our customers to live healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. Together, we will enable the IKEA transition towards a circular business, accelerate our climate agenda and do our part in supporting a more fair and equal society.” ESG Today Writing Staff Related Posts Companies / Honeywell, Johnson Matthey, GIDARA and Samsung Launch Alliance to Accelerate, Reduce Cost of SAF Production Executive Moves / T.

Leonard’s departure comes as HSBC undergoes a restructuring under new CEO George Elhedery. In November 2024, the firm announced the departure of Group Chief Sustainability Officer Celine Herweijer, after the restructuring resulted in the CSO no longer being included on the bank’s Group Executive Committee. HSBC appointed Julian Wentzel as its new CSO in February, and the firm also recently launched a low-carbon transition-focused infrastructure finance business headed by former UK Member of Parliament Danny Alexander. Alongside the restructuring, HSBC has also adjusted the focus of its climate and sustainability-related initiatives and targets. Earlier this year, the bank announced a decision to push back its 2030 target to achieve net zero emissions in its operations and supply chain by 20 years, and placed its interim targets to reduce financed emissions in key carbon-intensive industries under review, noting a “slower than envisioned” pace of decarbonization globally impacting its ability to reach its goals. At the bank’s shareholder meeting last week, HSBC reconfirmed its goal to achieve net zero by 2050, after shareholders raised concerns by the bank’s recent changes. Leonard joined HSBC in 2010, and was appointed Global Head of Sustainability at HSBC AM in 2021, with responsibility for leading the firm’s Sustainability office, charged with the delivery of the company’s sustainability business and product strategy. Prior to joining HSBC, she held senior roles at investing and financial services firms including Neuberger Berman, Lehman Brothers, and AEGON asset management. In a statement provided to ESG Today by HSBC, the firm said that Leonard’s “responsibilities will be shared between respective businesses within HSBC Asset Management and the Responsible Investment team led by Cathrine De Connick Lopez.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Garber joins GM after serving as CSO for technology giant Dell. The new appointment follows the retirement in November 2024 of GM’s former CSO Kristen Siemen after 30 years with the company. In her new role, Garber will oversee GM’s commitment to responsible business practices and environmental and social impact. GM has set a series of sustainability commitments over the past few years, including goals to become carbon neutral in global products and operations by 2040, and to reach 100% renewable energy for its U.S. sites by the end of 2025, and globally by 2035. The company has also invested heavily in the transition to electric vehicles following its 2021 pledge to eliminate tailpipe emissions from new light-duty vehicles by 2035, although the industry’s EV shift has hit headwinds in recent months on slower than anticipated consumer uptake and a less supportive regulatory landscape. In a Linkedin post announcing her new appointment, “trading keyboards for dashboards,” Garber said: “I grew up with cars. My grandfather owned a radiator shop in our small town of Huntingburg, Indiana. Every chance he got, my dad would take us to car dealerships just to look around. He sold cars for awhile. My husband was a service advisor (and a dang good one). If you know my family at all, you know we love epic road trips with our three kids and two dogs – these very adventures have led us to refer to our 2021 GMC Yukon XL as our living room on wheels. (Stay tuned for an epic family road trip in an all-electric Cadillac Escalade IQ soon!)… As luck would have it, my first day at GM is Earth Day. Sure feels like it was meant to be.” Garber joined Dell’s sustainability team in 2021, taking on the Chief Sustainability Officer role last year. Prior to joining Dell, she served in a series of sustainability roles at companies including McKesson, 3M and The Coca-Cola Company. Garber added: “If there’s one thing I’ve learned during my career, it’s that sustainable business is smart business. Reducing risk, seizing innovation and growth opportunity WHILE delivering real and meaningful impact is where it’s at. It’s hard, but when done, and done well, it’s transformative for both business and our world.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Wehrle will succeed Philipp Mueller, who has stepped down after serving as CEO since 2020. Founded in 2001, BlueOrchard offers impact investing solutions across asset classes, including private and listed debt, private equity, sustainable infrastructure and blended finance, with nearly $10 billion invested to date across more than 105 countries. Global investment manager Schroders acquired a majority stake in BlueOrchard in 2019. The firm announced last month that it has reached $5 billion in assets under management. Wehrle said: “BlueOrchard has supported hundreds of millions of people in emerging and frontier markets. It is an honour to lead the firm into the next chapter. I thank the Board for its trust and look forward to strengthening BlueOrchard’s position as a market leader in impact investing.” Wehrle joined BlueOrchard in 2021, and has most recently been serving as Head of Investment Solutions and Private Equity, responsible for overseeing the portfolio management and asset allocation of BlueOrchard’s funds and mandates as well as the development of product solutions. Prior to joining BlueOrchard, he held several management positions at Partners Group in Switzerland and UK. Peter Fanconi, Chairman of BlueOrchard, said: “With Michael we are delighted to promote a strong and proven internal successor as our new CEO. Michael’s mandate will be to position us for future growth, advancing towards our strategic goal to deliver impact investment solutions that meet our clients’ needs. Together with our highly talented staff, he will continue to serve our clients and write the next chapter in our 25-year history. “On behalf of the Board of Directors, I would like to thank Philipp for his exceptional contribution to BlueOrchard over the past years. Under Philipp’s leadership, BlueOrchard further enhanced its impact investment offering and increased its AuM to USD 5 billion, achieving a major milestone.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The new product announcements include the incorporation of sustainability considerations into Azure Migrate, the company’s service aimed at helping IT infrastructure teams, cloud architects, and project managers to analyze factors when considering their organizations’ migration to the cloud. Currently in public preview, the new capabilities add carbon emissions analysis to the migration assessment business case, enabling users to compare on-premise with Azure emissions when building a cloud migration strategy. In a blog post announcing the new features, Microsoft said: “By speaking the language of both cost savings and carbon savings, Azure Migrate gives insights to help build consensus across stakeholders evaluating how their move to Azure could benefit both the business and the planet.” Microsoft also announced the general availability of carbon optimization in Azure, a solution aimed at enabling continuous monitoring of the carbon emissions of Azure workloads, and providing emissions insights and recommendations to allow the incorporation of sustainability factors into daily cloud operations decisions. Key features of the carbon optimization capabilities include detailed data on carbon emissions from Azure usage, segmented by subscription, resource group, individual resource, type, and location, a carbon optimization dashboard integrated into the Azure management portal, and the ability to export emissions metrics for integration into reporting tools, dashboards, or sustainability systems. Microsoft said that carbon optimization in Azure also works in tandem with its Azure recommendation service Azure Advisor to analyze resource utilization and provide AI-driven recommendations to reduce carbon emissions. Microsoft added: “Together, sustainability in Azure Migrate business case and carbon optimization in Azure create an end-to-end loop for sustainable cloud computing that ensures that sustainability isn’t a one-time consideration but a core part of your cloud journey.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Danske Bank stated that it aims to achieve a net zero loan portfolio by 2050. Financed emissions typically make up the greatest aspect of a financial institution’s climate impact. Danske Banks’ new 2030 targets target the three sectors in the bank’s lending book that contribute to the highest CO2 emissions. The new targets include a 50% lending exposure reduction for oil and gas production, 20-30% reduction in emissions per unit transported for shipping and for utility companies, a 30% reduction in carbon emissions per kWh of power and heat generation. Carsten Egeriis, Chief Executive Officer at Danske Bank, said: “We have more than 3.3 million customers, and we cover the majority of sectors – including sectors that have a significant carbon footprint. This is why we are a part of the solution needed to address the climate challenges that we face. For the most part, our customers are doing a lot of work related to the green transition. But we also recognise that we have an obligation – as a leading Nordic bank, and with the resources we have at our disposal – to support our customers and contribute to the green transition in the societies that we are a part of, as well as to support Denmark in reaching its 2030 target for reduction in CO2 emissions.” Looking forward, Danske Bank is planning to continue setting 2030 targets by introducing goals for other sectors, including agriculture, housing, and heavy industry, with more sector-based targets expected later this year.

If the forecast is achieved, it would mark the fifth consecutive year of sustainable bond issuance at around the $1 trillion level. While 2024 issuance remained flat year-over-year at $1 trillion, however, sustainable bond volumes underperformed strong growth in the overall bond market in the year, with share of global issuance declining to 11% from 15% in the prior year. By bond type, green bonds are anticipated to continue to dominate, with Moody’s forecasting record issuance in 2025 of $620 billion, up slightly over 2024. Green bond issuance is expected to be driven by climate mitigation initiatives, with policy support, private sector pledges and cost declines in clean energy supporting climate investment through the year. Moody’s noted that even as the new U.S. administration “may have a dampening effect on global climate action,” clean energy investments will continue in other countries to support decarbonization and energy security. Moreover, Moody’s does not anticipate a significant decline in U.S. sustainable bond volumes in 2025, as reduced federal investment is offset by private sector investment, and certain state and local governments. Notably, North America has declined significantly in its representation in the global sustainable bond market, with volumes of $124 billion in 2024 already having declined nearly 30% from 2021. Among the key themes driving green investments highlighted in the report, Moody’s noted greater demand for financing of energy- and water-efficient data centers, and related investments in nuclear energy projects to help meet increased low carbon energy demand from data centers, as well as investments in emerging green technologies to provide low carbon solutions for hard-to-abate industrial sectors. Moody’s also forecast a continued diversification in green bond issuance towards financing adaptation and resilience projects “as the economic, financial and human costs of extreme weather rise and Paris Agreement1 targets look increasingly out of reach,” and towards nature-related projects driven by “growing focus on conservation of ecosystems and biodiversity to arrest the pace of global warming and limit its impact.” Notably, labelled bond financed adaptation and nature-related projects have been gradually rising over the past few years, reaching around 23% of green and sustainability bond proceeds in 2024, according to Moody’s. Moody’s also forecast that social bond issuance will decline by 9% in 2025 to $150 billion with a lack of benchmark-sized projects, and that sustainability bonds, combining green and social projects, will remain stable at $175 billion. Transition bonds, which emerged in 2024 with the government of Japan’s $11 billion inaugural issuance, are anticipated to remain flat at $20 billion, and dominated by Japan, but with potential for growth driven by diversification to other issuers. Sustainability-linked bond issuance is anticipated to grow by 14% to $35 billion,  but to remain well below 2021-2023 levels, with the market continuing to be pressured by investor scrutiny of the credibility and robustness of the bonds’ linked sustainability targets. In the report, Moody’s Ratings said: “We expect global sustainable bond issuance to be around $1 trillion in 2025, steady from 2024. Global focus on sustainable development and investment will support the market. But various deterrents, including heightened scrutiny of greenwashing, evolution in market standards and regulations, and a more complex environment, including political headwinds in some countries, will likely stifle growth.” Mark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The announcement follows the recent signing into law by President Biden of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which earmarked over $20 billion in funding for clean energy demonstrations and research hubs, aimed at accelerating the administration’s goals to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035 and a net-zero-carbon economy by 2050. With a focus on next-generation clean energy solutions, the law allocates $8 billion to clean hydrogen technologies, over $10 billion to carbon capture, direct air capture, and industrial emission reduction and $2.5 billion for advanced nuclear. Demonstration projects prove the effectiveness of innovative technologies in real-world conditions at scale. The demonstrations also aim to unlock follow-on investment from the private sector and enable widespread adoption and deployment of the new technologies. The DOE stated that the office’s programs also include billions to invest in demonstration projects in rural areas and economically hard-hit communities, as part of President Biden’s Justice40 initiative, aimed at delivering 40% of clean energy investment benefits to disadvantaged communities, and those experiencing the worst impacts of climate change. U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said: “Thanks to the investments Congress made in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations will move clean energy technologies out of the lab and into local and regional economies across the country, proving the value of technologies that can deliver for communities, businesses, and markets. This new office will hire the best and brightest talent to invest in cutting edge clean energy projects, and DOE is calling on anyone dedicated to addressing the climate crisis to roll up their sleeves and join us.” Emanuela Kerencheva Emanuela Kerencheva a Senior Student at the American University in Bulgaria majoring in Journalism and Mass Communications and Business Administration.
