Please send letters to ed****@un*****.ca. Unlike online comments, a letter to the editor must include your full name and city, and preferably your title (or role, such as graduate student) and institution. We reserve the right to edit letters for length and clarity\nOnline comments\nReaders may comment on articles online by using the comment function. We review all comments before posting them online to ensure that they are relevant to the topic and meet our guidelines on civility. We reserve the right to remove or to refuse to post any comments that we consider unacceptable. If you believe a posted comment contravenes these guidelines, please email us.\nWe do not post comments that contain:\npotential libel\nobscene, rude or racist language\npersonal attacks or threats\nproduct promotions or spam\npersonal information published without consent\ndiscussion unrelated to the article\nRequesting a correction\nPlease email to inform us of errors and to request corrections that may have appeared in print or online. We will always publish a clear, appropriate and timely correction when warranted.\nSubmissions\nMany of our best articles come from our readers and we welcome your ideas and submissions at su*********@un*****.ca. All emails to this address will receive an automated response acknowledging receipt. We try to but cannot always respond to readers’ mail individually.\nIf you send an unsolicited article, it will be read by an editor. However, in all cases we prefer to receive an email describing your story idea first, with a note saying who you are. If you submit a manuscript, we will not publish it without contacting you first. If you haven’t heard from us within four weeks, feel free to email again, but you may also assume that we are not going to use it.\nIf you have any questions, please contact us.\nOpinion pieces\nWe like to receive opinion pieces that voice a strong point of view. We are not interested in pieces that are promotion for a company, institution or department. Our opinion pieces are generally 750 to 850 words. We prefer to be the first publisher to publish your viewpoint or article. We rarely publish articles that have appeared in other magazines, newspapers or websites.\nEssays and articles from the university community\nUniversity Affairs actively solicits articles and first-person essays written by faculty members, administrators, staff and occasionally students. These may cover a wide range of topics but should have resonance with those who work and study at Canada’s universities. Length of essays and articles varies. We always prefer to receive a summary of your idea first.\nCareer development articles\nIf you would like to write an article for our career section, or if you are a graduate job seeker with an interest in a particular subject and would like to suggest a topic for us to cover, please contact the web editor at we*******@un*****.ca. We also occasionally publish first-person narratives about the issues affecting Canadians academics in their careers. Please contact the web editor for details.\nPeople on the move\nUniversity Affairs publishes appointment announcements at the director level and above including:\nPresidents\nChancellors\nChairs of boards\nVice-presidents\nAssociate and assistant vice-presidents\nDeans\nDirectors\nActing presidents\nWe also publish, at our discretion, selected awards announcements, such as the Killam Prizes, 3M Teaching Fellows and various prizes from the federal research granting agencies.\nPlease send appointment announcements to our digital journalist at HL*****@un*****.ca. Appointments are edited for length and clarity and are posted as they are received. All postings are removed after a maximum of 60 days online.\nFreelance guidelines\nIf you’re interested in writing for the University Affairs magazine or website for a fee, please read the magazine or our website before submitting ideas. We try to respond to queries promptly, but in exceptionally busy parts of the publishing schedule, it may take several weeks.\nIn general, we work with journalists who live and work in Canada and are familiar with the Canadian university system. When introducing yourself to us, we prefer a detailed query, along with samples of your writing and a short resumé, rather than a completed article.\nIf we accept your proposal, we buy first rights. We aren’t interested in articles that have been previously published or which have been accepted for publication in another forum or magazine. All articles are edited for clarity, length and style, and authors are informed of any significant changes to their work.\nWe use the Canadian Oxford Dictionary for spelling and follow the latest edition of the Canadian Press Stylebook. For French-written articles, we use Le guide du rédacteur of the Bureau de la traduction of the Federal Government of Canada for style. We use honorifics with names, so it is helpful if you determine whether the person you are citing has a doctorate or is a professor.\nIf you have any questions, contact us.\nThe University Affairs Newsletter\nKeeping Canada’s university community informed, inspired and connected\nEmail\nPhone\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n16810\nTopics\nAcademic freedom\nAdvice\nArtificial intelligence\nClimate change\nCopyright\nEquity\nIndigenous\nInternational students\nMental health\nResearch\nPublishing\nTeaching\nIn-depth\nFeatures\nNews\nArticles\nPeople on the move\nCampus Currents\nOpinion\nArticles\nSubmissions\nCareer Advice\nArticles\nSubscribe\nWays to subscribe\nPodcast\nRead the digital edition\nUniversity Affairs\nAbout us\nContact us\nAdvertise\nIssue archives\nJobs\nSearch Jobs\nUA Footer Symbol\nUniversity Affairs\nUniversity Affairs\nFacebook\nYoutube\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nAccessibility\nCopyright\nUniversity Affairs Privacy Notice\n© Universities Affairs 2025.

But in today’s universities, an increasing number of scholars find themselves trapped in precarious, low-paid sessional contracts – far from the secure careers they once envisioned.\nIn this episode of The Academic Issue, Dr. Jamie Paris joins Kate to discuss the systemic issues behind unstable employment in academia, drawing from his article The Exploitation Trap of Hope Labour. We explore the emotional and financial toll of “hope labour” and why universities continue to rely on precarious workers – but is real change possible?\nShow more\nShow less\nEpisode 2\nAI and Academia\nGuest\nMark Daley\nListening options:\nListen on Spotify\nListen on Apple Podcasts\nListen on Amazon Music\nListen on iHeart Podcasts\nListen on Podchaser\nListen on Podbean\nGenerative AI tools like Chat GPT have already sent shockwaves through the academic world, raising complex questions about academic integrity and the nature of learning.

Kate speaks with Kim Hellemans, a professor at Carleton University, to explore the multiple pressures faced by today’s professor, including the often complex student-supervisor relationship.\nWhat duty of pastoral care do faculty have for their students? Are some academics bearing more of the burden of student support than others? And what should faculty do to safeguard their wellbeing against the many strains of the academic life?\nShow more\nShow less\nEpisode 4\nThe Public Intellectual: A Conversation with Steven Pinker\nGuest\nSteven Pinker\nListening options:\nListen on Spotify\nListen on Apple Podcasts\nListen on Amazon Music\nListen on Podchaser\nListen on Podbean\nSteven Pinker is a cognitive scientist and the author of nine books written for a general audience. Prolific in his writing and media appearances, he is among the most prominent public intellectuals to have emerged from Canada.\nBut what impact does a lifetime communicating with the public have on an academic? How is writing for a general audience different to writing for an academic one? And what role should the public intellectual play in today’s information age?\nKate speaks with Steven in his office at Harvard University.\nShow more\nShow less\nKate Kenyon\nProducer and Host\nKate Kenyon is a digital content creator with a passion for research and academia.\nOriginally from the U.K., Kate began her career at The British Academy in London, where she collaborated with the Home Office to develop international mobility pathways for world-leading academics.

It propelled the career of neuroscientist Donna Rose Addis, leading her to win the 2010 Prime Minister’s MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize in her home country of New Zealand.\nDr. Addis currently leads the Memory Lab at the Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest, which is affiliated with the University of Toronto (U of T). There, a team of researchers is studying memory, identity and — of particular importance for Canada’s senescent population — the aging brain. She is one of the two dozen renowned scholars supported by the Canada 150 Research Chairs Program.\nLaunched eight years ago to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Confederation, the program provided a one-time investment of $117.6 million to Canadian universities to attract top-tier, internationally based scholars.\nDonna Rose Addis, C150 Research Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience of Memory and Aging. © Rachel Wong, Baycrest\nTwenty of the C150 Research Chairs are still active, engaged in research in the social sciences and humanities; natural sciences and engineering; and health and life sciences. However, the program is sunsetting this year — at a dramatic time for Canada and the world.\nTo rank the accomplishments of the chairs would be a monumental task, and for Ted Hewitt, president of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), beside the point.  “The aim was to attract people who were leading edge in their field, no matter where they happen to be, to come to Canada and create research hubs or centres,” he said.\nThe lab of Alàn Aspuru-Guzik, a C150 Research Chair in Theoretical Chemistry, provides a compelling example of such a research hub. A pioneer in the use of AI for chemical and materials applications, Dr. Aspuru-Guzik has brought in more than $20 million and grown his lab to include more than 40 highly qualified personnel since. “It’s not that I recruited them — they came, because it’s a movement,” said Dr. Aspuru-Guzik, who also holds a CIFAR AI Chair at the Vector Institute at U of T, one of Canada’s three AI institutes. “We want to make Canada, but also Toronto in particular, the leader in AI for materials.”\nFormerly at Harvard University, Dr. Aspuru-Guzik said choosing Canada made sense, not only for his research ambitions but because he was worried about the societal impacts when Donald Trump was first elected U.S. president in 2016. “I believe in democracy and justice, and when Trump gets elected — and I am Jewish, Mexican — I get really worried about how Trump is going to behave.”\nDr. Aspuru-Guzik is one of many scholars who accepted a C150 Research Chair in part because of the global geopolitical climate at the time the program debuted. Several others, such as Jennifer Welsh, an international affairs expert, were motivated by the shocking announcement that the United Kingdom was leaving the European Union after the 2016 Brexit referendum.  A renowned political scientist who served as special adviser to former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Dr. Welsh joined McGill University as the Canada 150 Research Chair in Global Governance and Society as it was preparing to launch the Max Bell School of Public Policy. “The chance to be part of building up something new at McGill was really interesting to me,” she said.\nJennifer Welsh, Canada 150 Research Chair in Global Governance and Society. © Owen Egan and Joni Dufour\nNow, having taken over as the school’s director, Dr. Welsh is passionate about teaching students how policy development interacts with partisan politics, and as with many of the C150 Research Chairs, is impressed with the calibre of Canadian students, from undergraduates to postdoctoral fellows. “There’s a great foundation, and now it’s about taking it to the next level […] I want to make it much more global in its orientation, both in terms of teaching and policy impact.”\nThis is a critical time for Canada to have a convening space for important policy discussions, Dr. Welsh says. The global context — much as in 2016 — is evolving rapidly, and existing institutions are struggling to adapt to sweeping global changes, including armed conflicts, mass migration, climate change and rising populism.\nComplicating that global reality is the growth of misinformation and disinformation online — with social media often becoming a breeding-ground for abusive language, discriminatory algorithms and ideological echo chambers. Seeking to mitigate those harms, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Canada 150 Research Chair in New Media at Simon Fraser University, is applying data science to understand how digital media are created and consumed.\nAfter returning to Canada from the U.S. in 2018, Dr. Chun founded the Digital Democracies Institute (DDI). The team she leads comprises 20 faculty members, two postdocs and more than a dozen graduate and undergraduate students from across the humanities, social sciences and computer and information sciences.\nWendy Hui Kyong Chun, Canada 150 Research Chair in New Media. © Simon Fraser University\n“The people who typically wouldn’t speak to each other are now working together to create innovative strategies to take on the hard issues facing the online world,” she said. The DDI’s research focuses on the spread of mis/disinformation, fostering democratic exchange online, data discrimination and the causes of echo chambers, among other issues.\nBeyond her work with the DDI, Dr. Chun works to promote Canada as a global centre for media research. She has contributed policy recommendations to the Canadian Commission on Democratic Expression and the United Nations High Panel on Internet Governance.\n“We’re helping to create the next generation. We’re giving our students tools and resources not previously available in Canada, so they can take on these important issues — and become world leaders in this work,” said Dr. Chun.\n‘Time to triple research funding’\nThe new Canadian government under Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney is promising to massively reform the Canadian economy in the face of a global trade war waged by President Trump’s second administration. The American university system is also under attack, with research funding gutted in critical areas such as climate science, and academic freedom at its most vulnerable.\nMany in the Canadian university sector believe that the turmoil south of the border presents an opportunity for Canada to again attract some of the best researchers from the U.S. and around the world. For the SSHRC’s Dr. Hewitt, recruiting the best people to keep Canada competitive in a rapidly advancing research landscape is “fundamentally a question of sovereignty.”\n“We have to look after ourselves – but we work in a global system and need to make sure borders remain open and fluid,” he said. “And as they do, we’ll make sure to make the best use of the talent that we have in Canada, attract the talent we’re able to from the outside and build the country that we all want.”\nAlàn Aspuru-Guzik, C150 Research Chair in Theoretical Chemistry. © Polina Teif\nThe new federal government promised to invest $100 million to bring researchers to Canada — particularly those whose funding has been cut in the U.S. In 2024, the previous Liberal government announced, not coincidentally in the lab of Dr. Aspuru-Guzik, $1.8 billion in federal research funding over five years. However, to date, only a fraction of that has been spent.\nThis year, Dr. Aspuru-Guzik will lose the funding provided by both of his chairs, which end in 2025, as well as investments from the U.S. He predicts his lab could be cut from 40 people to 10 by 2026. “I will do my best science I can with 10 people — but I think that’s the reality of what’s coming, and that’s a problem we have to face,” he said.\n“My message to [Prime Minister] Carney — and please quote me — is this is the moment to triple the funding for research in Canada.”\nThese four C150 Research Chairs are among the majority who intend to stay in Canada and, ideally, expand their research hubs even after the program ends. Since 2017, the chairs and their core team members have received more than 1,300 awards and trained nearly 1,000 undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.\nIn the Memory Lab, Dr. Addis foresees many more collaborations with Canadian researchers and institutions. She says she plans to apply for Canadian citizenship as soon as possible and make Canada her permanent home. “I really feel like I have found my people.”\nShe wants to advance her research by investigating how the power of our imaginations could help shift decision-making for better collective outcomes. What the C150 Research Chairs Program has made clear is that investments in Canada’s research capacity can bring positive outcomes for Canadians — at a time when we are dreaming big about our own future.\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nTags\nInnovation\nInnovation Week\nresearch\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Though such deep-fried fodder remains available, healthier options are becoming more widespread. As scientific studies highlight the harmful health effects of ultra-processed foods, awareness is growing about the benefits of a diet rich in vegetables, plant-based proteins, white meat, fish and whole grains. Young people are increasingly choosing to eat fewer animal products or to cut them out altogether, guided by their cultural or religious beliefs or their concern about the carbon footprint of raising animals for food. Students who crave a bowl of brown rice with grilled tofu and mixed vegetables, topped with green-onion-and-ginger sauce, might now be able to find it at a select Canadian university.\nEleven years ago, the Vancouver campus of the University of British Columbia (UBC) launched a food revolution. Campus food services developed a new vision of using fresh ingredients to provide healthy, delicious, inspiring, socially responsible and environmentally conscious meals. Ultra-processed foods zapped in the microwave were replaced with fresh meals made on site.\n“We had to hire a culinary team and a number of chefs to lead this revolution,” notes David Speight, executive chef and culinary director at UBC Vancouver.\nA full-time dietitian collaborated with the chefs to establish guidelines inspired by the university’s institutional values, Canada’s Food Guide and  Menus of Change (an initiative of the Culinary Institute of America and Harvard University).\nAt UBC, a typical plate consists of half fruits and/or vegetables, one-quarter protein, and one-quarter whole grains or high-fibre carbohydrates. Unsweetened milk, yogurt, and fortified plant-based beverages are available. Each service location offers daily vegetarian and vegan options.\nDietitians drive change\nOther institutions are following suit. Ontario’s University of Guelph (U of Guelph) has kept a dietitian on staff for the last two years. After participating in several training programs, its food services team now offers a menu featuring 50 per cent plant-based proteins.\nPhoto Courtesy of: University of British-Columbia\n“We have nearly 50 chefs and cooks from 12 ethnic backgrounds who infuse a tremendous amount of taste and flavour into our plant-based protein dishes,” says Vijay Nair, assistant director of culinary operations at U of Guelph. Nutrition students also promote healthy eating habits by offering nutrition education and peer support through the Student Nutrition Awareness Program (SNAP).\nIn Ottawa, Carleton University’s dietitian helps plan menus and holds free consultations for any student on a meal plan. The cafeteria has 15 stations offering a variety of options. The EatWell logo helps students identify healthy choices.\n“We are the main source of food for our 4,000 or so residents,” reasons Chad McKenzie, director of campus services at Carleton. “So it’s important to offer nutritious options.”\nWhat concrete contributions do dietitians make to university food services? “We can calculate the nutritional value of each meal,” explains Carol-Ann Robert, nutritionist-dietitian with Team Nutrition. “If it’s low in fibre, for example, we can recommend adding a vegetable to the recipe or changing out one ingredient for another. We also make sure that the menu is varied.”\nA transformation underway\nAlthough most Canadian university food services do not yet have a dietitian on staff, and many still offer a preponderance of fried foods and sandwiches on white bread, several institutions have begun transitioning to healthier options.\nUniversité de Moncton, for example, offers vegetarian fare, sourcing its vegetables from a local producer. “Many of our students come from Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Senegal,” notes Marc Surette, food services manager at Université de Moncton. “These are countries where people eat a lot of chickpeas and lentils, so we serve those on our menus.”\nEight years ago, Université de Montréal (UdeM), launched an initiative to offer a wider variety of dishes. Its menu includes vegetarian and vegan cuisine, and fish is served up once a week. It also prioritizes local sourcing — for example, buying Arctic char raised in a Montreal-based intensive water recirculation system.\n“Local sourcing is more expensive,” notes UdeM spokesperson Geneviève O’Meara, “but, on the flip side, plant-based proteins are not very expensive.”\nThe University of Saskatchewan is also bringing about change. “We now provide several plant-based options and want to offer even more,” says James McFarland, culinary services assistant director and executive chef. “We also occasionally have food like burgers on the menu, but we’re trying to educate students by providing nutritious alternatives, like our healthy bowls.”\nSetting an example\nMs. Robert feels that university food services can do more than just nourish: they can also provide an education. “The idea is not to strive for perfection, but to create an environment that encourages better habits,” she says.\nShe notes that some foods should be eaten daily, others occasionally, and others only rarely. In her view, a university should reflect this idea: “We don’t want to ban guilty pleasures, we just want to make healthier choices the norm.”\nMartine Letarte\nTags\ncampus\nfood\nhealth\nhealthy food\nnutrition\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

While touching on many topics, including the economy, defense, trade, Indigenous rights, protection of nature, border controls, gun laws and international relations, the speech had little to say regarding higher education. However, in the context of creating a new industrial strategy, the Throne Speech promised “to build hundreds of thousands of good careers in the trades and … make Canada a science and innovation hub.”\nThe speech outlined the government’s plan to ease the housing crisis by incentivizing a made-in-Canada modular housing industry and by giving tax breaks to first-time home buyers. Although it did not speak explicitly of alleviating costs for renters, many of whom are students, it did promise to cut municipal development charges for new multi-unit housing, which could potentially lower rents.\nLast week, Carney released his first official mandate letter to Cabinet, outlining a list of seven priorities. Although higher education was not mentioned explicitly, the goal of “attracting the best talent in the world to help build our economy, while returning overall immigration rates to sustainable levels” was named as the sixth priority.\nAccording to Statistics Canada, there are currently about 1.5 million temporary foreign workers and 944,000 international students (some of whom also hold work permits) in Canada. When family members are factored in, the total number of people residing in the country on work and study permits amounts to just over 2.5 million, or approximately 6.2 per cent of the total population.\nDuring the recent election campaign, Carney said that caps on international study permits imposed by the previous Liberal government would remain unchanged. The Carney government plans to issue 437,000 new study permits and extensions in 2025, down from 485,000 in 2024.\nOn the campaign trail, the Liberals also proposed a plan that would allocate $2 billion (in partnership with provinces) to develop new student housing. They also promised to invest $100 million in the Canadian Sovereignty and Resilience Fund to attract professors and graduate students whose funding is being cut in the United States.\nThis is the first time since 1977 that the reigning monarch has read the Speech from the Throne. Generally, the Governor General reads the speech as the representative of the Crown. King Charles’s visit is widely seen as a symbolic rebuke of U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to annex Canada to the United States and as an assertion of Canada’s existence as a distinct sovereign nation.\nHailey Leggett\nHailey is a University Affairs intern.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

It looks like my institution is going to take advantage of the volatility in the U.S. right now by poaching one or more U.S.-based faculty. What do established researchers new to the Canadian funding environment need to know to be successful with the Tri-Agency?\n– Anonymous, Research Grants Facilitation\nA. In many ways, moving to an institution in a new country is like going back to school: there are new people, new systems, new norms, maybe even new words to learn.\nAnyone who is the first in their family to attend university knows about the hidden curriculum — the unwritten norms, values, behaviours, and expectations implicit within academia, distinct from disciplinary knowledge and methods. If you come from a family that has experience of university, you’re more likely to be equipped with the cultural capital necessary to navigate academic systems than someone who is a first-gen university student.\nAnd the hidden curriculum isn’t bounded to degree programs: it persists among faculty roles as well.\nFaculty members new to the Canadian funding system need to be aware of the presence of unwritten rules within the Tri-Agency. Consider, for example, equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). I recently found myself reading the Canadian Council of Academies’ report Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in the Post-Secondary Research System, and found myself disagreeing with some of its findings, including its claim that applicants to SSHRC’s Insight Grant (IG) competition “are not required to explain the relevance of EDI to research design and practice in their proposals, and evaluators do not take these considerations into account during the peer review process” (2024, p. 102).\nThe evaluation criteria for the SSHRC IG may not state that peer reviewers are scoring applicants’ integration of EDI, access, Indigenization, decolonization, and intersectionality in the design of their research projects and their plans for student training, but—contrary to the report’s assertion—these factors are indeed considered during the peer review process. Talk to any recent SSHRC peer reviewer and they’ll verify that for you. I advise the researchers who I support that peer reviewers do want to see, for instance, disaggregated data analysis and inclusive, culturally safe working and learning environments for all members of a research team. EDI is being scored, even though it isn’t mentioned explicitly in the IG evaluation criteria.\nBecause I’ve long wanted to see the unwritten rules of research grant applications written down, I’ve been interviewing former Tri-Agency peer reviewers. In January 2025, I shared a document called Peer Reviewers’ Perspectives: NFRF Exploration & Transformation; in the coming months, I’ll be publishing the parallel documents for the CIHR Project, and NSERC Discovery competitions.\nThis month, I’m focusing on the SSHRC Insight and Insight Development competitions. I interviewed 49 former IG and Insight Development Grant (IDG) peer reviewers from across all the review committees in these two competitions; this free 46-page PDF contains what I heard from these interviews. In my opinion, the real gems are in the details—but because it would take me 46 pages to convey those details to you, I’d like to highlight my four key takeaways:\nThe budget matters to the penny\nThe SSHRC IG & IDG peer reviewers pay a lot more attention during their scoring to the budget than do peer reviewers for CIHR Project and NSERC Discovery, with a good number of peer reviewers telling me that they see the budget as outlining what a particular project will ‘actually do.’\nSo, instead of saying that your flight to Toronto will cost $600, you should say that it costs $614 or $588—quote a number that shows that you looked up real costs and aren’t simply guesstimating.\nIn November 2024, I wrote an article outlining a three-part budget justification strategy that I recommend for SSHRC applicants:\nJustify why the expense is necessary;\nJustify where the numbers come from; and,\nJustify how the expense was calculated.\nThat specific article was written in response to an IDG applicant, but in truth I use this three-part strategy to explain budget expenses for all SSHRC competitions: the IDG, IG, Connection, Partnership—everything.\nYou need to apply to the right committee\nAt SSHRC, if you’re a labour studies researcher interested in the representations of care work in Belgian graphic novels published in the 1930s, it may not be clear to you if you should apply to the literature committee, the committee that includes gender studies, or one of the multidisciplinary committees.\nI’m always telling my SSHRC applicants to look up last year’s peer review committee members—Google them; find their bios—using the publicly published details on SSHRC’s Merit Review Committees page.\nBy looking up who has served recently on a specific committee, you can get a sense of the range of expertise, methods, and theoretical frames used by that group of peer reviewers. I find that researchers who gather this bit of extra data can make more informed choices than colleagues who are going only on the name of the committee.\nYou want to write meaningful, appropriate training and knowledge mobilization plans\nA lot of researchers who apply for SSHRC funding end up writing standard, conventional student training and knowledge mobilization plans. In the social sciences, students are supporting data collection and analysis, and then they’re co-authoring publications and co-presenting at conferences; in the humanities, the students are updating annotated bibliographies, and then they’re co-authoring publications and co-presenting at conferences. Across disciplines, researchers are promising to write journal articles or chapters for their monograph, to publish an edited collection or a special issue of a journal, to present at conferences, and to submit a piece to The Conversation Canada.\nSuch plans are fine—for many peer reviewers, they wouldn’t prevent a good project from getting funded—but in a tight funding climate, a compelling, original, feasible training or KMb plan that is well-suited to the project can help peer reviewers to distinguish between two otherwise excellent, important research proposals.\nIf you have a fascinating, important, feasible project, and someone else applying to the same committee has a fascinating, important, feasible project, AND a novel, compelling, feasible, appropriate, tailored student training or KMb plan, then they just might be able to eke out the extra point or half-point that they might need to lift their application just that touch higher in the committee’s ranking and thereby get funded over yours.\nHaving said that, it isn’t easy to come up with original, meaningful, feasible and novel ways to train students or share knowledge, especially if you’ve never engaged in original, meaningful, feasible and novel training or KMb in your own undergraduate or graduate degrees. Back in May 2024, I wrote about the University of Toronto’s novel ‘scholars in residence’ program for undergraduates; at UBC, the Arts Amplifier’s collaborative cohort projects offer paid work-integrated learning experiences to small groups of graduate students. If you do community-engaged research, could your RAs work for or with a partner organization for part of their training? Does your institution provide supports for experiential or work-integrated learning that could become a part of your student training plan?\nIf your institution has a strong program in communications, digital media, film, photography, or fine arts, you might be able to recruit talented trainees to support your knowledge mobilization plan—just make sure that there’s someone on the team who can provide them with discipline-relevant advice and feedback, so they’re both working and learning at the same time.\nWhen it comes to knowledge mobilization plans, SSHRC peer reviewers repeatedly told me that the plans must align with the project—there must be a clear and logical fit. If you’re a social science researcher who is using PhotoVoice for data collection, then consider finding a way to enable research participants to opt-in to sharing their photos through an in-person or digital exhibition. Doing so would fit with the visual aspect of your methodology. If you’re a humanities researcher, consider experimenting with the strategies outlined in my February 2022 article, “Against utility and instrumentalization: knowledge mobilization for the humanities.”\nIf everyone applying to SSHRC is making a website, publishing on social media, hosting a one-hour public talk, or writing an article in The Conversation Canada, what can you do that’s different, but that also feels integral to your proposed research? The answer to that question can be a difference-maker for applicants in that frustrating ‘fundable but not sufficiently highly ranked’ zone.\nImportantly, your novel student training or innovative knowledge mobilization plan needs to be feasible, which—for peer reviewers—usually means it’s something you’ve done before. If you’re proposing something new, consider bringing on a co-investigator or collaborator who can support your plans. Doing so will reassure your peer reviewers that you’re not risking drowning alone, overwhelmed by a situation you’ve never been in previously.\nBut that’s just the high-level overview. Different committees have differing expectations—you wouldn’t expect a reviewer in the fine arts to want to see the same things as a reviewer in business studies, would you? I conducted these interviews and am sharing these quotations in the hopes of getting more of the unwritten rules for Canadian research grants written down, spelled out, and made clear.\nIf you’d like, I can email you the full, free 46-page PDF Peer Reviewers’ Perspectives: SSHRC Insight & Insight Development Grant, along with the NFRF guide published earlier this year. I’ll also drop you a note when the parallel guides for the CIHR Project and NSERC Discovery are published in this column next month and the month after.\nI’m coming to Congress!

Photo by Kate Jaimet\n0 Comments\nLast month, the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences (FHSS) — a pan-Canadian organization representing dozens of scholarly associations — announced that it will be unable to  hold its 2026 Congress after an unnamed institution backed out of months-long negotiations to host the event.\nIt is, instead, offering a virtual conference next year, with a “smaller-scale, in person event at a yet-to-be-determined location,” according to an announcement issued by FHSS president and CEO Karine Morin.\nCongress — whose June 2025 edition included some 7,000 faculty, graduate students and community members at Toronto’s George Brown College — is Canada’s largest academic gathering. The event has been a mainstay of Canadian humanities and social science research for nearly a century. The cancellation of the in-person event for 2026 has sent research groups into a scramble to arrange alternatives that will be smaller, less well-funded, and that will garner less attention from host venues and the public.\nThe road has been rocky for Congress since the COVID-19 pandemic, when the conference was cancelled in 2020 and moved online for 2021 and 2022.\nLast year, when Congress was to be held at McGill University in Montreal, dozens of scholarly associations cancelled their participation in the conference or made last-minute moves to alternative sites amidst an active strike by McGill professors in the Faculty of Law and a protest encampment in the field that would have hosted the Federation’s beer tent. Many research groups — my own included — found it untenable to ask delegates to gather behind picket lines in a business-as-usual manner, mere days after students had been tear-gassed on their own campus.\nWith a year to go before the next scheduled Congress in June 2026, some readers might wonder why the FHSS doesn’t simply find a new host. But the Federation has stated that alternatives have been considered, and ruled out, because of the logistics involved in mounting an event that can gather upwards of 10,000 people. For five years I ran the largest conference within Congress for the Canadian Society for the Study of Education, so I know first-hand how complex those logistical layers can be.\nHosting large scholarly gatherings has become something like the Olympics: expensive, politically fraught and an endeavour that few institutions are rushing to undertake amidst widespread austerity measures and mounting budget challenges.\nThere are alternatives to hosting conferences like Congress at universities — many comparable events in the United States are hosted at hotels and convention centers — but such venues almost always cost much more than academic spaces and come with their own suite of problems.\nSome of my colleagues have suggested that individual scholarly associations go their own way. They point to the Federation’s repeated crises as evidence that a century-old model of mega-conferencing doesn’t meet their members’ needs. They have a point: cost, accessibility and scholarly representation are serious issues that deserve attention.\nBut the death of in-person scholarly gatherings like Congress would be a real loss for Canadian research. Such gatherings create space (often imperfectly) for graduate students, early-career scholars and seasoned faculty to come together, share their research and build collaborative networks across universities, provinces and scholarly disciplines. Such conferences are one of the most reliable ways to meet with colleagues from far-flung institutions who don’t often travel to smaller research centers like my own city of Winnipeg.\nThe Federation in particular serves as an advocate for research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and dedicates significant funding to support research excellence and advance equity, diversity, inclusion and decolonization goals. Its logistical work hosting Congress each year enables many small, volunteer-run associations to focus on research instead of fiddling with administrative minutiae.\nCanadian research institutions face immense pressure, while internationally research in the humanities and social sciences is being directly threatened. Amidst this turbulence, Canadian academics need robust scholarly spaces to gather and strengthen the role of research in society. Scattering those spaces to the wind and duplicating organizing efforts does nothing to strengthen Canadian research.\nThe Federation is not a perfect organization. Its Congress has faced many challenges over the past seven years, for which it has been rightly criticized. But amidst those criticisms and the challenges facing Canadian researchers, we need universities to step up, prove that they value humanities and social sciences research, and continue to create spaces for that work to occur.\nCongress isn’t just an event, it’s a community. Creating strong research communities takes ongoing work, which means Congress needs champions willing to do that work — together.\nMichael Holden\nMichael Holden, PhD, is an assistant professor in the Faculty of Education at the University of Winnipeg.\nTags\nCongress\nFHSS\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

In 2018, 58 per cent of students at Quebec universities reported experiencing high levels of psychological distress, while in 2022, 67 per cent of students in Ontario reported a deterioration of their mental health.\nSupport measures often target individuals rather than their environment. Yet, the conceptual model for mental health surveillance developed in 2023 by the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (National public health institute of Quebec—INSPQ) illustrates that numerous environmental factors can also affect mental health.\nThe international Okanagan Charter (2015) invites universities and colleges to become health-promoting institutions. It emphasizes creating healthy living environments and reminds institutions of their responsibility to support this endeavour.\nHow can postsecondary institutions promote healthy environments?\nWe recently conducted a comprehensive review of environmental factors affecting the mental health of postsecondary students. We identified three broad categories:\nHousing environment\nSocial environment\nBuilt environment\nThe vital role of housing\nHousing is a fundamental determinant of good mental health and academic success. It is especially important in the context of the current housing crisis. The “housing environment” category includes the social and built characteristics of student dwellings. High-quality housing and access to indoor or outdoor greenery generally contribute to better mental health. Conversely, living in a small space (less than 60 m2) is associated with a greater risk of symptoms of mental distress.\nSocial environments: powerful yet invisible\nThe “social environment” category encompasses the various aspects of collective life, such as social capital and social cohesion. Having a large network and good supports, feeling connected and integrated into the learning environment, and living in a setting that prioritizes well-being and connection are all factors associated with better mental health. By contrast, the social environment in postsecondary institutions can also encourage student alcohol and drug use by normalizing or rewarding these behaviours. Discrimination or violence are associated with a higher risk of symptoms of mental distress and decreased mental health.\nBuilt environment: a boon to mental health — and the planet\nThe “built environment” category relates to natural and human-made features and amenities, such as urban design, green areas and public spaces. In general, exposure to nature and greenery is associated with better mental health. Quieter neighbourhoods with little traffic or pollution promote mental wellness, as does a walkable or bikeable environment. A high-quality campus setting, both indoors and outdoors, is also beneficial; for example, green spaces mitigate heat islands while beautifying the academic surroundings.\nHow can postsecondary institutions create environments that promote mental health?\nThe Okanagan Charter includes two calls to action. We’ve added our thoughts to these, informed by our comprehensive review:\nIntegrate health into all aspects of campus culture.\nPostsecondary institutions must create policies prioritizing inclusion and health. These policies enable the creation of social environments that promote connection and safety. To achieve this, institutions must understand how an environment can be experienced differently by different people. It is essential to take into account the different perspectives and needs of a diverse student body.\nUndertake actions and partnerships that promote health, both locally and globally.\nEducational institutions must identify collaborative opportunities to shape student environments on multiple levels. It’s important to decide which locations to prioritize, both on and off campus, and to identify the most influential players in each of these settings.\nTo learn more:\nStation SME offers information and tools to support educational institutions in creating learning environments that promote student mental health by addressing related environmental factors. A reflexive tool is available to guide institutions in this exercise.\nThis article is part of a monthly series on student mental health in higher education by the Observatoire sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur (Observatory on Student Mental Health in Higher Education—OSMÉES) and the Initiative sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur (Initiative for student mental health in higher education—ISMÉ).\nJustine Pineault, François Lauzier-Jobin & Martine Shareck\nJustine Pineault is a doctoral candidate in community health at Université de Sherbrooke and contributes to OSMÉES’s T1 pillar on healthy environments.\nFrançois Lauzier-Jobin is a social worker, assistant professor at Université de Sherbrooke’s nursing department, and head of OSMÉES’s T13 pillar on expanding mental health services.\nMartine Shareck is an associate professor of community health at Université de Sherbrooke and Tier 2 Canada Research Chair on Urban Health Equity and Young People (2020–2026).

Op-eds emerge, declaring either the death of Canadianization or its survival, sprinkled with anecdotes from a few departments. Meanwhile, those of us who have spent years looking into professors’ CVs have been watching this predictable cycle for decades.\nThe latest round in University Affairs features Ari Gandsman‘s warning of systematic Americanization squeezing out Canadian talent, while Dominik Stecuła sees Trump’s academic crackdown as Canada’s opportunity to attract displaced American scholars. Both bring compelling anecdotes, but they’re missing key parts of the story.\nWhat is unfolding is more complicated and nuanced: While both authors treat current pro-American hiring patterns as deviations from an imagined Canada-centric norm, such a norm existed only briefly — if at all — at many of Canada’s leading research universities. In the social sciences, especially, faculty hiring reflects a clear transition in influence: from British-trained scholars in the first half of the 20th century to a dominant reliance on U.S.-trained faculty after the Second World War.\nThe Canadianization movement of the 1970s and early 1980s sought to alter that trend, leading to formal policies in 1981 that required preference for Canadian citizens and landed immigrants in all aspects of academic hiring. But for the only three Canadian institutions ranked among the top 50 in the 2025 QS World University Rankings — McGill, the University of Toronto (U of T) and the University of British Columbia (UBC) — Canadianization turned out to be just a historical anomaly. Since the late 1980s, a great divergence at the institutional level has created two distinct spheres within Canadian English-speaking research universities, moving in different, often competing, directions regarding the doctoral origins of the scholars they hire.\nIn 2018, this article’s co-author Francois Lachapelle and sociologist Patrick John Burnett published the award-winning study “Replacing the Canadianization Generation: An Examination of Faculty Composition from 1977 through 2017” in the Canadian Review of Sociology. The Relational-Academia dataset tracked 4,935 faculty across five social science disciplines (anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology) at Canada’s U15 universities over four decades, with comprehensive PhD data.\nThe analysis of hiring patterns at McGill, U of T, and UBC — let’s call them “the triad”— reveals the stark reality. Between 1977 and 2017, these institutions drew 65 per cent of their social sciences faculty from U.S. universities and just 22 per cent from Canadian institutions. Of that modest Canadian share, 62 per cent represent cases of the triad trading PhDs among themselves or hiring their own graduates. This leaves a mere eight per cent of faculty positions at these three universities going to PhDs from all other Canadian institutions over four decades.\nPhD placement patterns at McGill, U of T and UBC, 1977-2017\nThis diagram maps the aggregate hiring patterns of U of T, McGill, and UBC’s Vancouver campus between 1977 and 2017, showing all institutions that placed at least 20 PhDs across the five social sciences disciplines of anthropology, economics, political science, psychology and sociology.\nBlue ribbons dominate the visual space, showing the overwhelming flow from U.S. institutions, mostly elite ones, to these three schools. Harvard leads, followed by Berkeley, Yale and Chicago — the familiar hierarchy of American academic prestige. Purple ribbons represent cross-hiring among the triad, while green ribbons show self-hiring, where institutions recruit their own PhDs (so-called academic inbreeding). Pink ribbons from the London School of Economics, Oxford and Cambridge show some presence from elite U.K. institutions — actually, as much as the rest of Canadian schools combined.\nThe narrow red ribbons tell the most revealing story: the limited access that other Canadian PhD-granting institutions face in placing their PhDs in the triad network. The green ribbon at U of T alone — representing self-hiring — is as thick as all the red ribbons combined.\nPhD Placement Patterns at Canada’s 12 Other Research Universities, 1977-2017\nThis figure shows hiring patterns in Canada’s 12 remaining.  U15 research universities in the same five social sciences disciplines. Red ribbons now dominate the plot, showing robust circulation among Canadian institutions — the Canadianization movement at work.\nThe blue ribbons representing U.S. schools are still present but tell a somewhat different story: The highest-prestige brands like Harvard and Yale represent a smaller proportion of the total, sharing space with respected but less renowned institutions. The grey ribbons show the full national weight of the triad, with U of T (with 261 placements), McGill (139) and UBC (110) serving as the top PhD suppliers to the rest of Canada’s research-intensive academic field. It’s a telling asymmetric relationship: McGill, U of T, and UBC primarily look past Canadian academia and outward to the U.S. for their own hiring, securing national and global prestige in the process, while serving as the primary PhD suppliers to the rest of Canada’s research-intensive universities. These three institutions serve as an interface between the global prestige economy and the domestic Canadian academic ecosystem.\nWe aim to release the Relational-Academia dataset publicly this year. In order to go beyond 2017 and track more contemporary trends, Lachapelle and Burnett’s most recent project, Subfield, has compiled the doctoral origins of all professors employed at Canadian universities across all disciplines for the 2022–23 academic year — the first complete national faculty census of its kind. Such efforts aim to contribute to a critical understanding of how academia and hiring practices are evolving in response to broader institutional and global pressures.\nThe End of Canadianization?\nThe continued dominance of U.S.-trained faculty at the triad is not incidental. Even during the height of the Canadianization movement, the triad retained over 65 per cent U.S.-trained hires, while that number declined to below 50 per cent in other Canadian universities. For the triad, status-group dynamics and hierarchies of prestige likely worked in favour of U.S.-trained candidates.\nThe institutional prestige and visibility of McGill, U of T and UBC likely attracted applicants from elite U.S. programs, whose graduates often carry strong publication records and embedded professional networks. But what counts as a “good scholar” is shaped by more than productivity — status signals, institutional prestige, and cultural fit all matter.  For the rest of the U15, the long-term trend toward Canadian-trained hires may have reflected both policy incentives and a commitment to developing domestic academic capacity, as well as a different applicant pool.\nBut 21st century trends are once again reshaping the landscape. The 2001 policy change that relaxed the Canadian First policy, which had previously required universities to advertise domestically before seeking international applicants, enabled universities to recruit internationally, thus re-inviting the influx of U.S.-trained scholars. This, combined with rising retirements among professors hired during the Canadianization era, an international student gold rush, and intensifying global rankings pressures shifted hiring patterns at schools like McMaster, Waterloo and Western beginning in the early 2000s. Together, these forces have nudged many institutions closer to the gravitational pull of American academia, once again reshaping not only who gets hired but also what Canadian academia aspires to be.\n*\nFrancois Lachapelle, PhD, is the lead scientist at subfield.dev and an academic program market analyst at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan.\nX.

But in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Quebec government made it a ministerial priority, thanks in no small part to the advocacy work of college and university associations. Today, the website Station SME provides an extensive catalogue of mental health resources and services accessible to students.\nJust because mental health services are available on campus, however, doesn’t necessarily mean that students will use them. Even today, a variety of barriers prevent students from accessing the services they need, when they need them. Some derive from students’ personal circumstances, such as their financial resources or time constraints, especially given their academic commitments. Additionally, the effects of poor mental health and past negative experiences may hinder students in seeking help.\nAccessing services isn’t only a personal choice. There are broader sociocultural and institutional factors at play. The visibility, availability and specificity of services in higher-education settings significantly influence accessibility. Similarly, the stigma surrounding mental health issues can discourage some students from reaching out.\nCase management: a promising approach\nSome post-secondary institutions have developed applications and ​​​websites​ to promote their mental-health services, such as the Plant des ressources at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi. While it’s certainly important to communicate the availability of services, this strategy alone is not sufficient, especially when students must wade through a vast array of offerings. Case management, a promising approach used in social work, has already been adopted by a number of institutions.\nIn simple terms, case managers provide individuals with personalized follow-up while coordinating and facilitating access to the institutional and community resources they need.​​ Recent research suggests case management has many benefits in the post-secondary context, from helping students with the transition to campus, to holistically addressing complex​ or specific needs​, to offering appropriate responses during crises, especially those related to social​​ health. However, the academic literature on the implementation and effectiveness of case management in post-secondary settings is relatively scarce and rarely identifies a preferred approach.\nStrengths as a pathway to recovery\nIn mental health, case management has been in wide application around the world since the 1980s. Various models are used, including broker, clinical case management, rehabilitation and​ ​strengths. The Strengths Model, which emerged about forty years ago, is today viewed as one of the most successful at helping individuals towards recovery. It is based on six fundamental principles: 1) everyone can recover; 2) the focus is on strengths rather than limitations; 3) the relationship is primary and egalitarian; 4) ​​​​the client directs the intervention; 5) the ​​intervention takes place in locations that are significant to the client; and 6) the community and environment are essential resources.\nWhile at first glance this model can appear simple, in reality it demands a range of complex skills that are honed in the back-and-forth between training and real-world practice. Champions of this approach highlight the importance of professional supervision. While the Strengths Model is considered effective at assisting individuals with severe mental health issues, its implementation and effectiveness among younger populations are not well documented. Our team’s comprehensive study identified only about ten published studies worldwide on implementing the model for young adults.\nMoving towards strengths-based case management​​?\nFrom the above, two key points emerge: case management appears to effectively address the needs of post-secondary students, and the strengths-based approach supports recovery for individuals living with mental health challenges. Starting from this premise, our team decided to focus on adapting and deploying the Strengths Model in Quebec’s institutions of higher learning. Our initial analyses show that, to varying degrees, practitioners in these settings are already using the core principles of the strengths-based approach. Nonetheless, our findings reveal the need for structured support and ongoing training to ensure that the six principles are truly integrated into practice.\nGoing forward, our ​​research will explore the adaptations needed for the Strengths Model to function in post-secondary settings.

His studies would focus on microdosing dried psychedelic mushrooms to treat depression.\nNavigating through the bustling, unfamiliar streets, he successfully arrived on campus to meet his supervisor, Rod Knight, and his new colleagues.\nIn the evenings, Kevin took the opportunity to gather with friends to share stories, cook traditional meals and celebrate their different cultures.

He works with faculty to develop and adapt courses and content with Indigenous approaches or Indigenous histories relevant to their field, while also trying to foster broader institutional change to integrate Indigenous perspectives in university teaching and learning.\nA registered psychotherapist and board certified behaviour analyst, Mr. Busch has over two decades of experience in mental health. He is also a doctoral student in the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education’s adult education and community development program, where he is a Vanier Scholar and was awarded the 2024 Talent Award from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. He says his original training was very quantitative – “evidence-based practice is the word that we love in the mental health world” – but he experienced a turning point that shifted his approach: his own experience with mental health struggles.\n“Many Indigenous people or First Nations people understand that our communities are filled with constant loss and constant unresolved grief, and this impact of intergenerational trauma is very real,” he says. In his 20s, he had his first real panic attack. “I did the whole classic ‘I think I’m dying’,” he says. “I knew that people who had panic disorders immediately think they’re having a heart attack. They try to find a medical explanation. They refuse to believe that this could possibly be psychological.” Despite knowing this, he followed the same path and went about trying to “cure himself in the most scientific way possible,” he says. While there was some benefit to this approach, the anxiety continued to occupy him and he decided to look elsewhere.\nA Bear Clan member of Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation, a community in northern Manitoba, Mr. Busch was well connected to cultural practice when he was young. However, after suffering intense racism during his teenage years in Saskatchewan, he says he had distanced himself from his Indigeneity. For years, his mother and other relatives encouraged him to attend Sundance, one of their most important ceremonies. “When I started to really struggle with my own mental wellness and I wasn’t finding answers anywhere, I thought, well, what the hell?” and “the first time I attended Sundance was just a radical change in my perspective,” he says.\nHe says that he doesn’t think that healing within First Nations communities will come from external mental health systems. “I think it will come from the development of the natural helping systems that are already there,” he says. Western institutions not only fail to acknowledge these systems, he says, but they actively suppress them. “There’s so much potential for those resources to be leveraged in a way that could be really meaningful.”\nHe became interested in the idea of helpers and helping work in all forms, “whether it’s a mental health professional, an elder, a knowledge keeper, a traditional practitioner, a natural helper in community,” he says. They don’t all have a designated role, but they’re seen by the community as leaders and as helpers. His doctoral research reflects this, and he hopes to articulate the conceptual, practical and relational aspects of helping work as described by Indigenous helpers. He has been visiting communities in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, focusing on Cree helpers. “My hope is that by developing a coherent theory of helping work it could be applied in the development of culturally relevant mental health practices,” he says.\nMr. Busch’s doctoral supervisor Jennifer Wemigwans says that his grounding in Indigenous knowledge has enabled him to “take that paradigm and use it in the health field – in a colonial field and space but bring in this diverse knowledge.” By doing that, he is “really shaking up and creating a new space in health research, in health in the community and in health resources,” she says. “I really feel that it’s important that we start to honor and acknowledge Indigenous knowledge within its own right and start to say how this is a valuable contribution in these spaces,” says Dr. Wemigwans.\nIn his new position, Mr. Busch has the opportunity to extend his impact across a range of disciplines. He says he is hoping to take “a teach-a-man-to-fish approach” to the role, where faculty work with communities to develop resources and materials that could be used on an ongoing basis. “There’s a finite amount of knowledge resources in community,” he says. “It’s a bit challenging for institutions to rely fully on Indigenous knowledge keepers, elders, scholars, researchers, to do the work of indigenization, decolonization, reconciliation, etc.” An important part of his role will be supporting faculty to do some of that work in a way that is informed by communities and is Indigenous-led, but that it isn’t a brain drain on the communities.\nOne of Mr. Busch’s first projects has been working on a workshop on the terminology associated with Indigenous pedagogies. “We throw these words around – indigenization, decolonization, resurgence, reconciliation – and there is a lot of discussion on all of those terms,” he says. He is working on a resource for faculty that would discuss these terms, their meaning, considerations, controversies and their practical application. He is also conducting an environmental scan of Canadian universities to see what others are doing on Indigenous pedagogy and curriculum development. “I know that there are some folks out there, Indigenous scholars that are just doing some really incredible groundbreaking work in this area and I’m really eager to learn from them.”\nMr. Busch says both of his parents are lifelong helpers and he has always felt a sense of responsibility to give back to community. “I’m also a Bear Clan member,” he says, “and in this clan system, there is a kinship responsibility.” Each clan has different responsibilities to community, such as leadership or education. “Bears have their nose to the ground and are always sniffing out the different medicines,” he says. “The idea is that the Bear Clan are kind of the carriers of medicine. They’re like the helpers and healers. I take that responsibility seriously and I try to align my values with those kinship responsibilities.”\nSparrow McGowan\nSparrow McGowan is a freelance journalist, writer and editor based in Ottawa.\nTags\nAutochtones\nIndigenous\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Stretching from Halifax Harbour to downtown Vancouver, these postsecondary institutions have been educating graduates for more than a century. Despite that history, their contribution to Canadian culture and economy remains underrecognized. Now, the leaders of Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD) University, NSCAD University, Alberta University of the Arts (AUArts) and Emily Carr University of Art + Design (ECU) have joined forces to form a new coalition. Tentatively named the UAD4 it aims to amplify their impact through a collective voice.\n“Essentially you could say we are the engine that creates arts and culture in this country,” says Ana Serrano, OCAD University’s president and vice-chancellor. “And as the engine that accelerates and develops the talent feeding into the entire creative economy in this country, we have an outsize role to play in how the Canadian future unfolds and evolves.”\nPhoto courtesy of: OCAD University\nThere are scores of art and design programs in Canada, but only four publicly funded universities entirely committed to these areas of study. Founded between the late 1870s and mid-1920s as vocational schools for largely male visual artists, they now offer programs in an array of art, design, media and creative disciplines. Programs range from the classics – such as painting, sculpture or photography – to contemporary specialities such as environmental design, integrated media and experimental animation. OCAD U is Canada’s largest, with 17 undergraduate and seven master’s degrees while Vancouver’s Emily Carr consistently ranks among the top 25 art and design universities in the world.\n“We recognize that there’s more that holds us together than separates us,” says Trish Kelly, ECU’s president and vice-chancellor. “This is a real opportunity to think about not just what we do for our local economies in context, but what we do for Canada. That’s really what this is about.”\nThe four schools have a combined total of 10,000 students each year – about half the size of Canada’s smallest research university. But UAD4 leaders are proud to note that their graduates’ impact defies expectations.\nThe creative sector contributes more than $50 billion to the national economy each year and employs nearly 740,000 people. While UAD4 grads are the sector’s driving force, many Canadians  – and their provincial governments – remain unclear, or maybe even unaware, of the extent to which art and design universities are crucial to the economy, say their leaders. “It’s easy to see why people miss what happens at arts school. But to be honest, our students and our alum are changing the world around us anyway,” says Dr. Kelly.\nThe trope of the struggling artist has long been worn out, say UAD4 leaders. A recent survey by OCAD U shows that more than 80 per cent of students are employed six months after they graduate. Alumni generally find work within their fields as graphic designers, illustrators, and writers among other creative disciplines. But many graduates also go on to work in everything from city planning to advertising and community development. “You name an industry, they’re at the forefront of it,” says Dr. Kelly.\n“It’s easy to see why people miss what happens at arts school. But to be honest, our students and our alum are changing the world around us.”\nThe same survey showed that more than 90 per cent of art and design graduates describe themselves as ‘their own boss.’ “A lot of our students ultimately are creative entrepreneurs that span across multiple sectors,” says Ms. Serrano. “The idea that somehow you go to art school, you become an artist, and that the artist is starving is a very traditional way of thinking about what is actually happening.”\n‘All of our programs are expensive.’\nA primary motivator for the coalition is the financial uncertainty that continues to plague Canada’s postsecondary education sector. The cap on international student study permits  imposed by the federal government in 2024 cut by nearly half a significant source of revenue for universities, while in some provinces operating grants have not kept pace with inflation. “Let’s face it, it isn’t exactly the smoothest sailing for universities right now,” says Dr. Kelly.\nAdding to that financial burden, the UAD4 face distinct challenges. Much of art and design teaching is practice-based education whereby students learn from practitioners in their field in a hands-on learning environment with small class sizes, such as a studio or workshop. Classes generally require expensive materials and technology – from oil paints and precious metals to 3D printers, laser cutters and virtual reality headsets. “We need state-of-the-art tools and facilities to train the next generation in both an academic and more industrial environment. It’s very expensive,” says president emeritus Peggy Shannon of NSCAD University, formally the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. Dr. Shannon, who previously served as chair of the school of performance at Toronto Metropolitan University, says at larger universities, the costs of practice-based classes or studios can be fiscally balanced by larger, revenue-generating lecture-based courses.\nArt and design universities aren’t afforded this luxury, and it’s a ubiquitous problem across the UAD4. “It’s harder to pack thousands of students into labs when they’re meant to be working with their hands,” says Ms. Serrano. “Part of our challenge, and opportunity, is figuring out how to bring that studio-based education into the 21st century.”\nLocal and regional communities\nOne of the goals of the UAD4 is to help both the public and provincial governments understand how art and design universities benefit their local economies. Over half of NSCAD graduates launch their own companies, not-for-profits or galleries, while the large majority find work in a creative field. “They contribute to the workforce,” says Dr. Shannon, “That’s obvious to me, but not necessarily to others.”\nThe province of Nova Scotia is currently trying to double its population to 2 million by 2060 to address labour shortages and boost its economy. But the provincial government doesn’t always make the connection between achieving that goal and Nova Scotia’s cultural scene, says Dr. Shannon. “Halifax and Nova Scotia are beautiful, and we offer the art and culture of the province and this region. I wouldn’t want to move to a new place just to be a doctor – I’d like it to be a nice place to live,” she says. One of the university’s three campuses is situated in the Halifax port, where 350,000 tourists pass every day. “We call it our front yard. We are contributing to what tourists see, think and feel about Halifax.”\nPhoto by: Caitlin Boyle\nAlberta University of the Arts, which is set to celebrate its 100th anniversary next year, is the largest employer of artists in Calgary. “The way we engage with the city is through the work that our faculty, alumni and students are doing,” says president emeritus Daniel Doz. The university partnered with the City of Calgary in 2023 to have alumni design visuals for concrete safety barriers that were installed between traffic lanes and summer patios. During the pandemic, “garage art” galleries popped up throughout Calgary’s residential neighbourhoods – nearly 40 per cent of those exhibits were AUArts alumni. “So [those examples] are the kind of thing, the visual interaction, where the influence isn’t in your face but maybe a little more subtle,” adds Dr. Doz. “When you’re the art school in town, our influence is relevant everywhere, depending on who wants to engage with us.”\nHowever, Dr. Doz admits that having that relevance recognized by the provincial government is challenging. The relationship between postsecondary institutions and the government has shifted significantly since he first became leader 15 years ago. “Postsecondary institutions are perceived as an instrument of economic prosperity – which is not false, each institution has an economic footprint,” he says. “But the relationship has shifted to how does it support a political agenda … because politicians now, their horizon is the next election.”\nIt’s the job of the UAD4 leaders to try to align their missions with that more narrow-minded focus of how some politicians look at the future. “That tension is challenging to navigate at the provincial level, so the four of us can have a little more weight by really sharing that message,” he says.\nUnique student body\nThe diversity of the student body is another unique characteristic of art and design universities. At AUArts, more than a third of students have at least one declared disability, while at NSCAD that number rises to about 42 per cent, with mental heath and learning challenges being the most prevalent. The two universities also have a high number of students who identify as 2SLGBTQ: 60 per cent at AUArts and more than three-quarters at NSCAD.\n“You have a population that exists in art school that society would say exists on the fringe,” says Dr. Doz. Arts schools are often the place where they find community, acceptance and support.\nAlberta University for the Arts also has a higher number of Indigenous students compared to most universities, not only for of its location on Treaty 7 territory but because of its style of teaching. “We teach by making – much in the oral tradition,” he says. “I have an Elder Council and the bands and reserves that they come from, it’s all oral history. When you teach by looking at things, by talking and then making, it caters to people who don’t learn in a traditional way.”\nIndigenous representation at the institution has helped guide the “artistic and cultural conversations” that have occurred across Western Canada, according to Dr. Doz. He points to alum and world-renowned First Nations artist Alex Janvier, who is considered a pioneer of contemporary and abstract Indigenous art.\n“We need state-of-the-art tools and facilities to train the next generation in both an academic and more industrial environment. It’s very expensive.”\nDr. Kelly, at ECU, says the school’s Health and Design Lab is symbolic of how art and design universities bring criticality and awareness to Canada’s progress on goals including truth and reconciliation. For instance, the lab’s interdisciplinary team includes design students, faculty and research associates who partner with the ECU’s Aboriginal Gathering Place. Together, they host Elders, nurses, health care workers and community organizations to create and share stories about racism in the health care system and amplify voices often missing in conversations about systemic health inequities.\n“I’ve had the privilege to be witness to some of those gatherings. But I can only say they’ve brought light and hope and even joy to those individuals who’ve come together to communicate about these difficult issues,” says Dr. Kelly.\nWhile the coalition is still in its nascent stage, the UAD4 aim to meet quarterly to discuss the best way to advocate for their collective needs – but also for a better future for Canadians.  Ms. Serrano, who co-chairs the Open Democracy project, an initiative that develops partnerships to reimagine democracy, says art and design skills are essential to graduates that will help define systems for the future. “What artists and designers know well is that they don’t know what will come next,” she says. Being comfortable with what might emerge – in the artistic process or in society – provides an adaptability that “everyone needs” in a rapidly changing place.\nThat unique perspective is invaluable  when tackling complex questions about how to move forward in the face of national and international problems. Artists and designers, says Dr. Kelly, can help imagine solutions to the “complex, knotted, sticky problems” facing Canadian society.\n“My concern is how to instill hope, how to make sure we are actually moving in a coherent and strategic way to make change in a world that quite dramatically needs it,” she says. “If we can’t apply curiosity, imagination and creativity to those sticky problems, we’re never going to find solutions.”\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

What are the long-term effects of the gender imbalance on campus –– and what can we do about it?\nBy\nSonia Mendes\nApril 30, 2025\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nGraphic by: Edward Thomas Swan\nRead this article in French\n2 Comments\nWhen Tia Lovegrove walked into her political science class on the first day of a new semester in January 2025 she was struck with a realization.\n“There was only one male student in that class; out of 25, I saw one male student,” says Ms. Lovegrove, a fourth-year student completing a double major in political science and law, justice and society at Dalhousie University in Halifax.\nOver the past four years, she has grown accustomed to seeing few males in her classes, particularly in law classes.\n“In half my classes, we have barely any male enrolment,” says Ms. Lovegrove, who plans to pursue law school after she completes her undergraduate degree. “I feel like it’s almost normalized that if you’re going into these classes there’s not going to be very many male students in them; no one has really ever said anything.”\nMs. Lovegrove’s experience reflects a reality that Canada’s postsecondary institutions seem reticent to discuss: Campuses are dominated by female students while male enrolment has stagnated –– and it’s been happening for decades.\nOn average, postsecondary campuses consist of 56.1 per cent women and 43.9 per cent men, according to 2022-23 data from Statistics Canada.\nIn 2024-25, undergraduate students at Dalhousie consisted of 54 per cent females and 44 per cent males (with two per cent of students identifying as “other”). Female enrolment was slightly higher amongst graduate students, with 57 per cent females, 42 per cent males (one per cent identifying as “other”). By faculty, female undergraduates dominated in agriculture, architecture, arts and social sciences, health, science, dentistry, law and even medicine. Only the faculties of computer science, engineering, and management had higher male enrolment.\n“We are aware of the ongoing challenges in achieving balanced gender representation across various fields of study,” a Dalhousie spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement to University Affairs. “We are committed to identifying and addressing barriers to ensure that all students, regardless of gender, feel supported in pursuing their academic and professional aspirations.” When asked whether the university has any specific measures to address the gender imbalance the spokesperson declined comment, reiterating that university administrators “monitor and measure many aspects of our enrolment data.”\nAt the University of Montreal, the numbers are considerably higher. A 2022 UdeMNovelles article noted that nearly seven out of every 10 students at the university were women. Statistics from 2024 are consistent with that figure, with over 67 per cent of students identifying as female.\n“The statistics have been stable over the last few years, and it’s true that the trend has reversed, with more women than men in higher education,” wrote a University of Montreal spokesperson in an emailed statement. “It’s also worth noting that more girls are graduating from high school, so the pool of women applying to pursue their studies at university is correspondingly larger. The issue of gender-based recruitment is a sensitive one these days; that’s why we advocate that our recruitment strategies are as inclusive as possible.”\nBack in the classroom, Ms. Lovegrove worries that student discussions at Dalhousie are often missing the male perspective.\n“In a political science class, or focusing on big topics like human rights, I feel like you do have to have multiple perspectives to be able to fully understand such a big issue,” she says.\nAt Carleton University in Ottawa, Cara Gordon shares similar concerns.\n“It’s definitely imbalanced; we kind of joke about it,” says Ms. Gordon, a third-year journalism and humanities student. “In humanities, we’re a class of about 30 right now and in my year I believe there’s six guys.”\nIn one of her seminar groups, which are intended to facilitate discussion, there are no males at all, she adds.\n“I was thinking, ‘Would the guys bring something up that we wouldn’t think about?’” she says.\nThings haven’t always been so lopsided in the journalism and humanities program, says Dr. Gregory MacIsaac, associate professor of humanities at Carleton.\n“It wasn’t the case when the program started [in 2014]; almost half the class was men,” recalls Dr. MacIsaac, who helped to design the program, offered jointly by the university’s college of the humanities and journalism and communication school. “And then that started to go down slowly. Over the last three years, in a class of 30, there were like seven or five males.”\nDr. MacIsaac admits he’s perplexed by the dwindling male enrolment. Carleton University declined interview requests with their recruitment and enrolment team members and did not provide a statement about the imbalance of gender enrolment.\n“It really has changed; I don’t know why,” he says. “It’s very tempting to come up with an easy answer and say, ‘Oh, well, you’re doing humanities and that just is soft,’ and it appeals to women more than men, but it’s rather insulting and sexist.”\nIn fact, findings from a recent study at the University of Zurich directly supports the theory that men selectively leave occupations and specializations, and devalue them, when the number of women in these jobs increases –– a concept sometimes called the “male flight theory.”\n“When comparing two hypothetical occupations that are identical in all occupational characteristics and only differ in the share of female inflow (25% vs. 75%), the analysis shows that men are twice as likely to leave the feminizing occupation,” according to lead researcher Dr. Per Block, professor of sociology at the University of Zurich.\n“Young males are dropping out of the labour force. They are dropping out of school. They are nowhere. They’re in their parents’ basements, and I think that’s very scary for the future.”\nLong-term economic and social impacts\nMiana Plesca, a professor in the department of economics and finance at the University of Guelph, doesn’t mince words about the state of male postsecondary enrolment.\n“There are nearly two girls for every boy that graduates,” says Dr. Plesca of the overall female to male ratio. “Young males are dropping out of the labour force. They are dropping out of school. They are nowhere. They’re in their parents’ basements, and I think that’s very scary for the future.”\nFor the 2022-2023 academic year at Guelph, 60 per cent of undergraduate students were female. Dr. Plesca explains she has studied the trend with her students and the gender gap goes back decades.\n“We went back with some students to the first year of the labour force survey, where we could find data –– in 1978,” she says. “Already in 1978 more women were graduating than men; it’s not a recent phenomenon.”\nAs a specialist in labour economics, Dr. Plesca says she’s concerned that males opting out of postsecondary education will have a hard time in the future labour market.\n“Economists worry because of skill,” she explains. “Skill is ever more important; with AI and everything, low-skill jobs are getting obsolete and they’re getting replaced by robots, and you need high-skilled workers. And because of the university access, the high-skilled workers in the labour force are more likely to be female.”\nStagnating male enrolment is not just a Canadian issue. Dr. Claudia Buchmann is a distinguished professor of sociology at The Ohio State University. In 2013 she co-authored a book with Thomas A. DiPrete called The Rise of Women: The Growing Gender Gap in Education and What it Means for American Schools.\n“This is pretty much a global trend,” says Dr. Buchmann. “In the book we have a map of the world that shows, at the time of writing, that for the majority of countries in the world, especially industrialized countries, now more women are enrolled in higher education and complete college degrees everywhere in the world. That was pretty striking to us.”\nLike Dr. Plesca, Dr. Buchmann is concerned for the long-term economic well-being of men.\n“By all arguments, the college degree still is very much an important piece of social mobility,” she says, noting that in the U.S., a college degree is ranked at the same academic level as a university degree.\nBeyond potentially stunted earning potential, Dr. Buchmann worries about intangible gaps in male socialization.\n“Think about what higher education can do in terms of being able to develop critical thinking, being able to be presented with diverse ideas or views from people who come from very different perspectives,” she says, adding that “Education for Citizenship” is her university’s motto. “It’s important to be in those social environments, interacting with someone that’s very different from you –– an international student or a student from a different part of the country, from a rural area versus an urban area.”\nShe points to worrisome ideologies in the U.S. which have been creeping into Canada as well.\n“Schools are just a microcosm of what’s being reflected in the larger society,” she explains. “And in the United States right now, we have a really serious problem of the resurgence of this kind of patriarchal notion of ‘make America great again,’ and [the threat to] traditional family structures. And all of these things are, I think, largely due to the fact that some young men are feeling the decline in patriarchy has meant that they’re worse off and that women are to blame for that.”\nChoosing a different path\nSo, what are young men doing if they’re not choosing to attend postsecondary institutions? In Canada, some are lured by the entry-level earning potential of the oil patch. Kyle Cyr, now 24, graduated from high school in Edmonton in 2019. Although he had respectable grades in high school and university was “definitely a possibility,” Mr. Cyr jumped at the chance to earn some good money instead.\n“I ended up getting a job basically the weekend after I graduated, working just south of Edmonton in Nisku on an oil rig; I worked there for just over 10 months,” he says. “Jumping out of high school and then earning oil rig money, it was pretty crazy.”\nUltimately, he says the money wasn’t enough to keep him there for the long run.\nSo Mr. Cyr took on several roles, including as a barista at a climbing gym and a greenskeeper at a golf course, before finding work he loves at Rabbit Hill, a ski resort on the banks of the North Saskatchewan River. Today, as the terrain park supervisor, he manages staff and uses heavy machinery to build the jumps and rails for snowboarding.\n“Being able to do a job that involves my passion, I couldn’t ask for anything else,” enthuses Mr. Cyr, who has been an avid snowboarder since the age of 12. “Obviously it doesn’t pay as well as some other jobs would, but at the same time, I’m willing to sacrifice that little bit of pay for waking up and actually being excited to go to work.”\n“K to 12 should pay a bit more attention to why girls do better than boys in school –– pay more attention to pedagogy and see what makes boys more motivated and engaged.”\nKieran O’Donnell, 19, also opted out of college or university. While attending high school in Ottawa, he considered several career paths.\n“I thought about going to other industries, like electrician, where you obviously need to go to college to get your certificates,” he recalls, adding he always did well in school despite not loving it. “I wanted to be a paramedic at one point; I had a bunch of ideas bouncing around.”\nIt was the thought of enduring more lecture-style classes that altered Mr. O’Donnell’s trajectory.\n“I was just sitting in class and I thought, ‘I cannot do this for another two to four or whatever, how many years,” he says.\nWhen he was 16, Mr. O’Donnell had worked with an interlock company as part of a high school co-op program. That experience turned out to be life-changing.\n“I’m one of those kids who just can’t sit still; I’ve always got to be doing something,” he says. “Co-op was an amazing opportunity for me, as it was for many people, specifically males.”\nWhile still in Grade 12, he launched his own contracting business –– O’Donnell Contracting –– specializing in interlock patios and garden beds. Like Kyle Cyr, Mr. O’Donnell loves the physical, outdoor nature of his work.\n“One thing I love about my job is I’m outside,” he says. “I’m talking to people, I’m enjoying the beautiful summer; I just love what I do.”\nMr. O’Donnell notes that the financial investment required for a postsecondary education was a deterrent for him.\n“Knowing I wanted to go into business and be making money, going into school to spend a bunch of money before you even made any seems like a step backwards for me,” he says. “I have no student debt. I’ve been working.”\nFinding new ways to engage male students\nKyle Cyr and Kieran O’Donnell are examples of bright, young men who chose not to pursue postsecondary education. To encourage more men to continue their education, Dr. Plesca suggests the Canadian public school system should consider how boys learn differently compared with their female peers.\n“K[indergarten] to [Grade] 12 should pay a bit more attention to why girls do better than boys in school –– pay more attention to pedagogy and see what makes boys more motivated and engaged,” says Dr. Plesca, who notes her own son struggled in the school system compared to her daughter. “I don’t think that girls perform better than boys once they graduate. I think they perform equally well. But K to 12 shows them [girls] as performing better because it rewards certain skills: They’re more organized, they’re more disciplined, they pay more attention.”\nExtensive research on gender, mobility and college attainment support Dr. Plesca’s suggestions. In their report entitled The Secret Behind College Completion, published by the U.S. think tank Third Way, Dr. Buchmann and Columbia University professor Thomas A. DiPrete suggest that “because boys’ academic deficit is well established by middle school, reforms targeting the early and middle school years offer the greatest potential for closing the gender gap in college completion.”\nThe report goes on to say that a student’s academic future can already be forecast by the time they hit middle school, based on key indicators.\n“We found that eighth grade grades are a very strong predictor, using nationally representative data, of the likelihood of persisting in college and getting a college degree,” says Dr. Buchmann. “These things start earlier than perhaps some people think.”\nDr. Buchmann also suggests there could be more teamwork between high schools and postsecondary institutions, to help bridge the gap for students who are on the fence.\n“Colleges can do things like having summer preparation programs, or more collaboration with high schools,” she says. “Maybe take a class at the college level while they’re in high school and explore it.”\nIn light of widespread funding issues in North America and beyond, there are no strong indications that postsecondary institutions are interested in addressing the gender gap. To do so could be construed as discriminatory, argues Dr. Plesca.\n“What are we going to do, put quotas?” asks Dr. Plesca. “If we put quotas, girls are going to sue us; if according to the admission criteria women look better than men, women might say, ‘No, this is discrimination.’ So, it’s a very slippery slope.”\nDr. Buchmann predicts the financial pinch currently being faced by U.S. colleges, partly due to declining enrolment and rising operating costs, will drive postsecondary institutions to offer more variety.\n“Universities here [in the U.S.] are grappling with just how to stay in business, many of them; a lot of universities will probably fail in the next decade in this country,” she says. “So [they will need to consider] creating new programs, creating new certificate kinds of programs or new things that don’t require four years.\nThe hope, says Dr. Buchmann, is that these efforts will be enough to better engage male students.\n“We need men and women in all of the fields that make up a healthy society and economy.”\nSonia Mendes\nSonia Mendes is a freelance writer and editor based in Ottawa.\nTags\nMale enrolment\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(2 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Enrolment numbers for male students in post-secondary have been comparatively low for years! None of this is news. We kept telling our boys that they are not good enough because they underperform and underachieve; therefore we have raised men who shrug their shoulders in resignation. We cannot plant peas and reap corn! Haven’t we  as a society reaped what we have sowed?\nReply\nLorne Carmichael\nMay 1, 2025 at 10:00 am\nI published an article in University Affairs on Sept 1, 2015 related to this topic. It was entitled “Male – Female Imbalance in STEM Comes Down to Economics”. For some reason the search feature here does not seem to go back this far, but I can quote the final lines:\n“Current educational policies focus on encouraging girls in math and science. What if we put the same energy into helping boys do better in all the other subjects? This would increase the proportion of women in STEM by giving boys an alternative. At the same time it might begin to address the other major equity problem in our universities – the severe under-representation of males.\nSurely this is a policy we can all support.”\nWell, I guess I was wrong. Since then Jordan Peterson has been vilified for encouraging young men to grow up, many young women are finding it impossible to find a partner they can respect, and our equity professionals remain uninterested.\nReply\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMore from Features\nFeatures\nInternational students\nInside the life of an international student\nEvery day brings new adventures, challenges and opportunities for a student coming from abroad.\nby\nSelena Phillips-Boyle\nMay 26, 2025\nFeatures\nArts\nNew coalition forms to advocate for art and design universities\nIt’s time to shine light on the impact of art and design schools, say presidents.\nby\nHannah Liddle\nMay 14, 2025\nFeatures\nPolicy\nThe challenges facing Nova Scotia’s postsecondary institutions\nUnexpected government policy changes have choked off revenues while rising costs threaten to topple painstakingly balanced budgets.\nby\nAngela Mombourquette\nApril 23, 2025\nFeatures\nPolicy\nUniversities at a political crossroads\nCanadian universities are facing uncertain prospects as they weigh the\nLiberal Party’s mixed record on postsecondary education against\nConservative threats to EDI initiatives and research funding.\nby\nMohamed Berrada\nApril 16, 2025\nMore from Enrolment\nFeatures\nEnrolment\nWhy medical faculties are broadening admissions criteria\nUniversities across the country are tweaking their admissions processes to attract students from less-privileged backgrounds.\nby\nWendy Glauser\nMarch 04, 2020\nOpinion\nEnrolment\nWhere are all the international students universities were promised when Trump was elected?\nDespite a widespread media narrative claiming students would be flocking to Canada, universities did not see a “Trump bump.”\nby\nCreso Sá\nMarch 02, 2020\nNews\nEnrolment\nInternational student enrolment continues to soar in Canada\nDespite the success, the country’s universities look to diversify the source countries to avoid over-reliance on a few key nations.\nby\nMoira MacDonald\nMay 06, 2019\nThe University Affairs Newsletter\nKeeping Canada’s university community informed, inspired and connected\nEmail\nPhone\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n9132\nTopics\nAcademic freedom\nAdvice\nArtificial intelligence\nClimate change\nCopyright\nEquity\nIndigenous\nInternational students\nMental health\nResearch\nPublishing\nTeaching\nIn-depth\nFeatures\nNews\nArticles\nPeople on the move\nCampus Currents\nOpinion\nArticles\nSubmissions\nCareer Advice\nArticles\nSubscribe\nWays to subscribe\nPodcast\nRead the digital edition\nUniversity Affairs\nAbout us\nContact us\nAdvertise\nIssue archives\nJobs\nSearch Jobs\nUA Footer Symbol\nUniversity Affairs\nUniversity Affairs\nFacebook\nYoutube\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nAccessibility\nCopyright\nUniversity Affairs Privacy Notice\n© Universities Affairs 2025.

Underlying much of its growth has been a simple problem with no clear solution: a drastic lack of permanent academic positions compared to the number of PhD graduates produced in Canadian universities. GPD programming now provides career support for PhD students that was often absent in the past, and it has undoubtedly aided many PhD students in preparing for the transition away from academia. The underlying problem, however, has not gone away, and neither PhD programs nor the job market show signs of adapting to accommodate the overproduction of PhDs. When it comes to facilitating career transition, have we reached the limit of what GPD can offer within the structural constraints of the university system and the Canadian job market? I pose this question as we enter a time of austerity for higher education in Canada, knowing that permanent academic jobs or postsecondary teaching positions of any kind will become increasingly scarce, and that broader economic troubles may also be on the horizon.\nGPD, from the beginning, has focused on skills rather than knowledge — the latter being the domain of the various academic disciplines. A key document in the development of GPD in Canada is the 2012 report prepared by Marilyn Rose for the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in which she identified a need for training in transferable skills for graduate students, as well as for instruction on how graduate students can reframe their academic skills and describe them to potential employers. This focus on transferable skills and skill translation is now a key part of GPD.\nThe hard reality that this skills discourse continues to obscure, however, is that no student completes a PhD program for the sake of developing transferable or translatable skills. It is also not clear to what extent high-level academic skills — in critical thinking, deep analysis, knowledge synthesis, and similar — are transferable or translatable from one realm of knowledge to another, or if those gained from a PhD are that much different from those gained from a master’s degree once they are removed from a disciplinary context.\nThere are limits in the non-academic job market as well, which still does not demand PhDs. (The 2021 report by the Council of Canadian Academies, Degrees of Success, addressed this problem.) While PhD graduates are typically capable people who will eventually find decent work, we know that there are still few non-academic jobs that require PhDs or make full use of PhD-level academic skills. Certainly, there are none that provide opportunities for self-directed research of the scope and depth that is characteristic of academic research.\nSo is this it? Is this the best we can do? It may be all we can do as people working in GPD. There could, however, be something that disciplines can do by rethinking the purpose of PhD programs. By this I do not mean making PhD programs something different than what they have always been. What makes PhD programs important and worth keeping is not ultimately the skills they provide but the disciplinary knowledge they help create, preserve and transmit. PhD programs socialize students within an academic discipline and train them to be scholars. I suggest that instead of relying on GPD and the language of transferable and translatable skills to expand the definition of what PhD students can do, academic disciplines can work to expand the definition of what constitutes scholarship, who can carry it out, and where it should take place.\nWill professional academic research remain an all-or-nothing career option, confined to lifelong institutional positions accessible to comparatively few PhDs, or can it be somehow distributed among the vast numbers of PhDs whose knowledge and academic skills remain chronically underutilized?\nWe can encourage public scholarship — as GPD programs increasingly do — but for most PhD students, any skills they develop in this field will be put to use after graduation in contexts outside of the realm of specialized disciplinary knowledge. In the end, it is up to faculty to decide how to create sustainable futures for their disciplines and how society can harness the collective disciplinary expertise of the PhDs they have trained. I can only say that GPD and the skills discourse, however crucial they are for helping PhD graduates make the best of an unfortunate situation, will not be enough. We seem to have reached a limit, and the question is where to go from here.\nDavid Lafferty\nDavid Lafferty is a professional development coordinator\nin graduate studies at Carleton University\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(2 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

The research project itself should be what is funded on merit – we have to stop thinking of grants as propping up universities.\nReply\nValentina Galvani\nJune 4, 2025 at 4:45 pm\nGreat article. Three throughts.\n1. Faculty members in disciplines for which there is no obvious pathway to non-academic jobs could take a first step by being very honest with prospective students about the probability of entering academia after graduation. It is sad to see faculty members taking on Ph.D. students and advising them on topics for which they know there is no Plan B and no (or almost none) academic positions.\n2. Let’s not forget that there are students taking on the Ph.D. to facilitate immigration. For these students, point 1 above does not necessarily apply. (Yes, there have been changes to immigration law, but a longer program  still provides a better chance to immigrate.)\n3. Inform Master’s students about the placement of former Ph.D. graduates. That should serve as an eye-opener to those who think a Dr. suffix opens the door to academia.\nAll this said, Ph.D. applicants (and then students) are adults. They make their own choices, and Universities should not get in the way too much.\nReply\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMost popular\n01\nCareer Advice\nAdvice\nSSHRC Insight and Insight Development Grant\n02\nCareer Advice\nPolicy\nThe limits of graduate professional development\n03\nData vs MAGA\n04\nCareer Advice\nWriting\nTeaching students the connection between writing and thinking\n05\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity News and Careers\nSubscribe\nAD\nAdvertisement\nFlight 302\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity of Ottawa President and Vice Chancellor Marie-Eve Sylvestre\nFeatured Jobs\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Cybersecurity)\nUniversity of Regina\nPsychology - Assistant Professor (Speech-Language Pathology)\nUniversity of Victoria\nVeterinary Medicine - Faculty Position (Large Animal Internal Medicine)\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\nEducation - (2) Assistant or Associate Professors, Teaching Scholars (Educational Leadership)\nWestern University\nBusiness – Lecturer or Assistant Professor, 2-year term (Strategic Management)\nMcMaster University\nView all jobs\nMore from Career Advice\nCareer Advice\nAdvice\nSSHRC Insight and Insight Development Grant\nPeer reviewer’s perspectives.\nby\nLetitia Henville\nMay 27, 2025\nCareer Advice\nWriting\nTeaching students the connection between writing and thinking\nWriting is an important skill because of its role in thinking processes.

When students outsource their writing assignments to AI, this opportunity to strengthen thinking skills is lost.\nIn my last column, I wrote about the inevitable deskilling that will occur in the AI environment and the importance of proactively preserving “writing as thinking”.” In this column, I explain why I believe this is necessary and how we can do so.\nUnderstanding the connection between writing and thinking\nWhen we attempt to put words to a page, we surface our areas of confidence and confusion, identify the holes in our logics, and bring forward new creative ideas. As Dan Shipper writes, “a certain kind of thinking is only possible through writing. … When you turn the vast, interconnected network of thoughts, feelings, and ideas in your mind into a line of words, you find sequence, order, and story. You expose fallacy and fuzziness. … And writing doesn’t just tell you what you already think somewhere in the cobwebbed attic of your brain. It actively helps you to generate new—and better—thoughts and ideas as you do it.”\nResearch suggests that writing is tied to critical thinking (particularly inference and scientific reasoning) and, over time, changes how the brain functions. Simply put, we become sharper thinkers when we write and more skilled at thinking the more we practice writing. This risks being lost if students abandon writing in favour of AI.\nHow instructors can strengthen the connection between writing and thinking\nTo protect writing as a tool for developing students’ thinking, we must reconsider our teaching approaches. Here are ideas to start:\n1. Emphasize learning and thinking over the written artifact. The ‘products’ of writing are both the learning and improved thinking emerging from the research and writing process and the actual written artifact. We need to use assignment structures and weighting to prioritize learning and thinking,\nDesign assessments can include ‘thinking evidence’. Examples:\nHave students submit both a research paper and an accompanying reflection worksheet in which students answer specific questions. (Examples from John Warner: “What have you discovered that is new to you? What line, idea, or concept occurred to you while writing that you hadn’t planned on? … What do you know now that you didn’t know before?”)\nAccompany scaffolded assessments with a written or oral ‘thought evolution’ assignment in which students explain what changed in their thinking about the topic.\nLeading up to an assessment, have students submit journal entries describing their research and writing process, including what they are learning and how their thinking is evolving.\nUse assessment weightings to convey the importance of thinking and learning. Place high weight on the ‘thinking evidence’ and low weight on elements that can reasonably be done by AI (e.g., grammar, formatting, bibliographic style), unless those elements are an important learning outcome for your course.\n2. Be explicit with students about the linkage between writing and thinking. Ask students to discuss how they have experienced evolution in their own thinking through the writing process. Tell students about how writing improves your thinking.  Play them this short audio clip of Turing Award recipient Leslie Lamport arguing “If you think you understand something, and don’t write down your ideas, you only think you’re thinking.”\n3. Bring writing activities into the classroom. Use classroom activities to promote writing as thinking. For example, have students write their answers to a particular question for five minutes, and then discuss their thinking process with a classmate. The University of Waterloo Centre for Teaching Excellence’s Using Writing as a Learning Tool provides additional activities to consider.\n4. Provide students with writing study prompts.  Provide students with a list of short-answer and essay questions to practice as part of their exam preparation – even if the exam doesn’t include such questions. As Shane Parrish writes, “Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about. … writing about something complicated and hard to pin down acts as a test to see how well you understand it.”\nWriting as thinking: call to action\nPaul Graham argues that AI will lead to “a world divided into writes and write-nots. … Instead of good writers, ok writers, and people who can’t write, there will just be good writers and people who can’t write. …. a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots.”\nI believe that as university instructors we have an opportunity and imperative to push against this. I encourage all of us to do so.\nContinuing the Skills Agenda conversation\nHow do you teach writing as thinking?  I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.\nI look forward to hearing from you. Until next time, stay well, my colleagues.\nLoleen Berdahl\nLoleen Berdahl is a 3M National Teaching Fellow, an award-winning university instructor, the executive director of the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy (Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina), and professor and former head of political studies at the University of Saskatchewan.

indeed you will find this makes up a rather large percentage of conference attendees today.  Scholars need to get their name out, get to know other scholars, and talk to presses and perhaps hiring committees.  As we age, we tend to do fewer of these and focus on publication, since once we are known in our field, we don’t need to show up to “perform” quite as often.  At the same time, conference attendance can be even more attractive and beneficial in a later career: a keynote or invited lecture is something that everyone likes to see on their CV.  There is also the series of social activities, ad hoc or planned, that happens at these conferences, and this can be one of the best benefits to our careers as well as our mental health.  Intellectual stimulation and social connection are important in our mostly isolating research lives, and so there is something very inspiring and invigorating to conference presentation and attendance, especially for people from small departments or small universities and independent scholars.\nHowever, conferences are expensive.  Anywhere from a few hundred dollars to more than $700 are typical costs for just the registration fees.  And then there are often add-on activities or dinners that can cost quite a bit, although they may enrichen the experience.  Banquets at conferences, often provided by corporate caterers, are heavy on the budget and rarely tasty.  Depending on who you are seated with, it could be the connection of a career or a boring wasted evening.  Airfares are exorbitant these days, and in places like New York City, where Airbnb’s were outlawed, the cost of hotels is also quite high.  Sharing a room with a colleague is one possible remedy, especially if it allows you to enjoy a bottle of wine in the room with a grad school buddy, but that is rarely the norm.  And then there are ancillary costs: transportation to and from airports and hotels, coffee and meals, and perhaps the cost of picking up a book at the book table (even on conference discount).  Depending on the location and length of the conference, this can add up to thousands of dollars for only a few intensive days of enjoyment and career advancement.  Not to mention that conferences take away your focus and energy at just the time of year when you want to get some serious work done.\nThe dilemma is that sometimes the most important events (getting a book deal, meeting a collaborator) can happen at conferences.  This has certainly been true for me.  But let’s look at what else you could spend perhaps $2000 to $3000 for an international conference on, if you skipped one such conference a year.\nBooks: From an average academic press, this could be 40 to 60 academic books.  Imagine how that would enhance both your library and your understanding of the field.\nTA or grading assistance: At $20/hour, you would have approximately 150 hours of extra TA or grading assistance, which is almost 12 hours a week for a 13-week term.  Many at large universities have teaching assistants provided from departmental budgets.  For those who don’t, this could be life-altering.\nPost-Doc: You don’t have to get a large grant or a full-time position to find a post-doc who is interested in providing support for your research on an hourly basis.  At $50/hour this would give you 10 hours a week for six weeks in the summer to have a colleague edit, do research, or otherwise support your scholarship.\nProfessional Development:  At costs of $150 and up per hour, you could work with an academic developmental editor or academic coach and improve your work/life balance, or develop your nascent scholarly ideas.\nVacation: Let’s assume you pay for a conference out of your own pocket.  This could get you well on your way to a getaway in the Caribbean or a cruise.  No tax deduction, but a relaxing and restorative trip.\nAlthough this all sounds good, I admit we don’t all have resources to spend on conferences.  However, imagine if we skipped just one expensive event per year and put the money toward any of these other worthy aims.\nWhile we never know when that wonderful opportunity or meeting will happen at a conference, or how it might launch a career – to a certain degree, it’s serendipity – I would suggest weighing your options.  If the attendees include a new body of scholars to you and your work is new or emerging, and your session is very specific, it is probably worth going.  If you are trying to get a book deal and can guarantee facetime with an editor, it is probably worth going.  As for online conferences?  I personally don’t like them because they offer none of the upsides with many of the downsides.  But they are convenient and often very inexpensive or even free.  My best advice is that reducing your live conference attendance by a certain percentage and diverting those funds in other directions (or saving it); you might end up on the winning side of the bargain.\nElizabeth Wells\nElizabeth Wells is a professor of music history and musicology at Mount Allison University as well as author of the book The Organized Academic.\nTags\nHiring\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Since President Donald Trump’s election in November 2024, they had been duplicating government web pages, interactive tools and datasets in case the new administration decided to change, delete or irretrievably conceal them.\nBy the end of January, about 2,000 pages had gone missing from the total inventory of about 310,000 pages on U.S. federal government websites. “That’s 2,000 missed opportunities; 2,000 things that people won’t find there anymore,” says Eric Nost, associate professor of geography, environment and geomatics at the University of Guelph.\nThen, in a January 20 order, the U.S. government directed all federal agencies to acknowledge only two biological sexes and to “remove all … internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.” Information such as the results of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey were taken down — although that particular page was later restored after a court order, with a disclaimer stating that the administration rejects its contents.\nIt’s normal for government digital materials to change as they are revised or become redundant. When new governments come in, more rewrites and deletions happen, often reflecting the agenda of the administration. “The surprising thing here has been the scope and speed of these changes,” says Dr. Nost.\nDr. Nost works with the U.S.-based Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI), a group formed in 2016 during the first Trump administration whose mission includes safeguarding vulnerable environmental data. “We saw fairly significant efforts to change website language and the way issues such as climate change and energy were described,” Dr. Nost says of President Trump’s first term, adding that datasets were largely left untouched at that time. “This time around, the scope of changes is much wider.”\nRecently, Dr. Nost has been duplicating interactive tools used to access datasets, including the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, which was taken down on January 22. He helped recreate the interactive map and repost it on the site of a climate group.\nWhile Dr. Nost is Canadian and the data is American, it’s hugely important to him and to his colleagues. “The U.S. federal government is the world’s largest publisher of information,” he says. Kristi Thompson, research data management librarian at Western University, noted, “People go to their data because they have great, detailed data sets. A lot of Canadian research and worldwide research is based on those sets.”\nConcerns in Canada\nMs. Thompson is part of group of about 50 people with the newly hatched Canadian Data Rescue Project, which is backing up minor government department sites. “There is a clear assault on public data and public knowledge going on in the United States,” she says. “If you destroy the trust in public data collection, that’s significant. And I’m concerned the same thing could happen in Canada.”\nPrior to the Canadian federal election in April 2025, Katie Cuyler, open publishing and government information librarian at the University of Alberta, was doing her part to safeguard information as part of the End of Session Archive conducted by Internet Archive Canada. “The vibe is chaotic and uncertain,” she said of that time.\nEstablished in 2004, Internet Archives Canada is affiliated with California-based Internet Archive, which digitizes books and preserves old versions of websites on its Wayback Machine. One of the first digital preservation initiatives, the Internet Archive dates to 1996, when the Internet itself was growing and becoming increasingly accessible. Like newspapers, the content published on the web was ephemeral — but unlike newspapers, no one was saving it.\nMore groups and projects started in 2008, with elections on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border in a digital era. Libraries, which used to keep paper copies of government documents, had begun making virtual backups. In the U.S. the End of Term Web Archive launched, while Internet Archive Canada began backing up government data.\nIn 2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Conservative government abolished the long-form census. In 2012, it defunded of the First Nations Statistical Institute and closed a slew of federal government libraries. In response, a group of committed library professionals launched the Canadian Government Information Digital Preservation Network (CGI-DPN). “What happened in 2012 really lit a fire,” says Ms. Cuyler.\nFinding better ways to save\nThere are a dizzying number of groups and projects tackling the preservation of vast amounts of tough-to-track information. “What’s freaky about datasets is when they’re gone, they’re just gone. You’re relying on other things to know they even existed,” says Ms. Thompson.\nNow, those doing this work are seeking to improve their protocols. “While the data does not go away, it becomes harder to access,” says Matt Price, assistant professor of history at the University of Toronto, who works with EDGI. “We’ve had initiatives to back up dataset but nobody ever used the data. It was like we took the family inheritance and put it into big glass jars and buried it in the backyard.”\nThere’s a push to establish common repositories and to ensure that academics, librarians, students and the public know where to find them. The Wayback Machine is well-known, and librarians are promoting the repository Borealis, a partnership of numerous university libraries hosted at U of T, which contains materials such as agricultural and environmental datasets.\nAs well, saved information needs care over time, says Andrea Mills, executive director, Internet Archive Canada. “Some of the government documents that we have digitized are almost 20 years. We have to go back and do the optical character recognition over again, improving formats and leveraging new technology.”\nBig tech risks\nDr. Price struggles with storing materials on cloud platforms run by tech giants such as Google and Amazon Web Services, some of which offer in-kind donations to U.S. data-backup groups. According to CNN, Amazon and Google each donated $1 million to President Trump’s inaugural fund. “I think we should be careful. We should recognize that we are entrusting important work to untrustworthy actors,” Dr. Price says.\nIn a perfect world, Canada would collect more of its own data, and the safety of evidence-based materials would be carefully protected here and elsewhere. For now, there’s backing up, coding, collaborating and hoping for the best. “This is a stressful time,” says Ms. Cuyler, “and a reminder that democracy takes a lot of work.”\nDiane Peters\nDiane Peters is a Toronto-based writer and editor.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

At the end of 2023, Canada hosted more than one million international students. The sharp rise, however, was not accompanied by a long-term strategy for growth, according to many within the higher education sector.\n“There was never really any coordination with governments or cities in how to respond to the subsequent pressure on housing and certain public services,” says Alex Usher, president of Higher Education Strategy Associates. “When these problems reared their heads, the government reacted by constraining study permits.”\nIt’s a challenge not just for Canada, but across the globe. Australia implemented caps in 2024 and doubled study visa fees to counteract the effect of immigration on the cost of housing. The United Kingdom and the Netherlands are also among the countries tightening their regulations.\nTensions to do with the housing crisis and, in Quebec’s case, the purported anglicization of Montreal are contributing to changing perceptions about temporary immigrants. Behind these shifting opinions lies a complex political landscape.\n“We have forgotten the social and economic value international students bring to our communities,” laments Larissa Bezo, president and CEO of CBIE. “International education has become a highly politicized subject in the last year and a half. We’re undermining Canada’s reputation in the long term for short-term political gains.”\nThe rise of edugration\nThese changing perceptions point to a deeper unease arising from a shift in the role of international students and universities in Canadian immigration policy. “Canada has traditionally sourced immigrants from abroad, but over the last 20 years, the focus has increasingly shifted to those already residing in the country, such as temporary workers and international students,” notes Lisa Brunner, a postdoctoral fellow at the Centre for Migration Studies at the University of British Columbia.\nThis has led to the phenomenon known as ‘edugration’, where international education becomes the preferred way to source immigrants with diplomas who speak at least one of the two official languages and can more easily integrate into Canadian society. CBIE surveys reported that, in 2023, 70 per cent of international students hoped to obtain a work permit after graduation, while 57 per cent intended to apply for permanent residency.\nUnder former prime minister Justin Trudeau, the government viewed rising international students enrolment favourably. Universities seized the opportunity to partially make up for their lack of public funding, since international students generally pay much higher fees than Canadian students. “Their presence helps our universities support more Canadian students than public funding could alone,” confirms UBC spokesperson Thandi Fletcher. According to Statistics Canada, the average undergraduate international student paid $36,100 per year in fees in 2022.\n“We have created a source of private income within public institutions, and they have come to depend on it,” notes Dr. Brunner. “Meanwhile, universities are tasked with recruiting immigrants despite being neither trained nor funded to do so.”\nNew approaches to recruitment\nUnder the circumstances, universities are struggling to adapt to these abrupt provincial and federal reversals. They are now faced with reimagining their approach to international education.\n“The caps are forcing us to revisit our recruitment methods to prioritize quality over quantity,” remarks François Gélineau, vice-rector of international affairs and sustainable development at Université Laval. Recruitment strategies have long focused on flaunting an institution’s reputation to attract as many international registrations as possible — and it has worked. In 2023, Université Laval processed more than 60,000 international applications.\nBut with this swell came a similar increase in applications from candidates unqualified to complete a university degree. “It doesn’t serve anyone to set students up to fail while putting pressure on our resources,” Dr. Gélineau explains.\nA new recruitment strategy should be more sophisticated, relying not just on publicity but on developing stronger partnerships with foreign institutions, offering services to prepare students in their country of origin, and targeting applicants who meet program requirements. “We’ve tested these techniques but haven’t fully implemented them because we were seeking volume,” explains Dr. Gélineau.\nThough each university is adapting, individual approaches don’t amount to a coherent national strategy that reaps the benefits of the international education while better managing its challenges. “We need a permanent framework that facilitates coordination and improves dialogue between universities and governments at both the federal and provincial levels,” urges Christopher Busch, associate vice-president, enrolment management, at the University of Windsor.\nHe notes that recent governmental decisions were made without consulting academic institutions and laments how quickly they came about. Successive changes, like increasing the financial requirements for student visas and capping admissions, complicate the assessment of each measure’s individual impact on the number of international student registrations.\n“The cumulative effects of these changes could result in a much greater reduction in international student applications than expected,” he warns. An ApplyBoard study from January revealed that, in 2024, study permits at the undergraduate level dropped by 41 per cent, and by 38 per cent at the graduate level. Both figures exceed the 35 per cent target set by then-Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Marc Miller.\nThis lack of consultation also explains the poor planning for coping with the repercussions of the international student surge. “We know the effects of international students on our campuses, but the impact on housing, the job market, local economy, and general immigration are another matter,” says Dr. Busch. “We need to share information and coordinate.”\nTaking student experience into account\nThe recent series of political decisions and reversals has created tremendous uncertainty for university leadership, but also for current and future international students. “The general impression is that Canada doesn’t really want more of us,” says Jovial Orlachi Osundu, president of the international student association at the Université de Moncton.\nThis perception may be stronger among racialized students, who sense a more negative attitude about immigration among the population. Jovial Orlachi Osundu arrived from Nigeria in 2020 and is currently a student of social work. She considered studying in South Korea or the United States, but chose Canada due to its strong reputation, which reassured her parents.\nShe emphasizes that a concerted Canadian national strategy ought to take student experience into account. “Student experience can vary widely,” she says. “Country of origin, financial means, and how easily someone is able to access university or community services make a difference.”\nKeeping our commitments\nLarissa Bezo believes that we should fulfill our promises to other countries by improving support for international students, from choosing a Canadian institution up to — and including — transitioning into the workforce.\nShe also suggests that Canada should recruit from a broader range of countries. Currently, about half of international students in Canadian universities come from China and India. “It’s important to be perceived as an inclusive destination and to lower the risks associated with certain countries,” she says.\nIn May 2024, the CBIE organized a conference on international education with more than 225 participants. Among the group’s proposals were the creation of a pan-Canadian committee for international education, a student advisory committee, a centre for international education excellence and a national campaign to restore international students’ image.\nParticipants also highlighted the need for increased public funding to postsecondary institutions, a challenge Dr. Brunner says is especially crucial. “As we think about international students, we must also embark on a deeper reflection of how we support our public education system and the real reasons we’ve seen such a steep increase.”\nJean-François Venne\nJean-François Venne is a Montreal-based journalist specializing in education, research, innovation and business.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

We have unique opportunity now to find a political party that will be doing some of the recommendations presented in this article.  I would like to know which party you think would best support the CIBE proposals or how we can make this more of an election issue?  There are many potential permanent residents and future Canadians who want to do more with their education here or to be educated here and the Canadian people need to take a more complex and accurate view of students who come here from elsewhere (and immigrants in general).  The people I know who are professionals and highly educated people in this country are finding the policies under the previous government since Covid and the housing crisis much more difficult and restrictive.  I think we need to go in the opposite way, especially in the medical, financial, and technical fields (professionals – educated here or elsewhere, but striving to live in Canada).  Thank you for the article.  I thought there would be more when I started looking for articles on the topic of immigration, international students, and public policy platforms during an election.  Best wishes from Vancouver, BC.\nReply\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMore from Features\nFeatures\nInternational students\nInside the life of an international student\nEvery day brings new adventures, challenges and opportunities for a student coming from abroad.\nby\nSelena Phillips-Boyle\nMay 26, 2025\nFeatures\nArts\nNew coalition forms to advocate for art and design universities\nIt’s time to shine light on the impact of art and design schools, say presidents.\nby\nHannah Liddle\nMay 14, 2025\nFeatures\nEnrolment\nSolving the male enrolment puzzle\nIn Canada and around the world, young men are opting out of postsecondary education.

The decision raised several questions about payment policies and the communication process of the administration.\n“It’s fine to ask people to pay their tuition, but UQAC changed the rules in the middle of the semester,” said Étienne Paré, president of the Quebec Student Union.  “When discussions took place with UQAC about payment of tuition a few months ago, no mention was made of students’ immediate removal. This was handled clumsily and carelessly — a significant change that was poorly explained.”\nThe consequences of deregistration are significantly lower for students from Quebec than they are for international students noted Mr. Paré, explaining that “such a draconian measure is meant to target one or two outlying cases,” and that “it’s time for international students to stop bearing the brunt of policy decisions.”\nThe university stands by its decision. Marie-Karlynn Laflamme, UQAC’s manager of public affairs, argued that “most of the deregistered students hadn’t yet made a tuition payment. “Four never even arrived at UQAC; but it is true that this was very short notice. Our leading considerations are good management and a fair tuition payment policy.”\nIt is worth noting that UQAC ran a $6.4 million deficit in the 2023–24 fiscal year.\nLack of communication\nOn Sept. 25, UQAC announced major changes to its tuition payment policy. Students were required to pay 60 per cent of their fees by Oct. 3, and if they did not meet the deadline, they would be expelled from the university. This new policy contradicted invoices issued in July and August that merely noted a penalty of $25 would be applied to each late payment. Students who did not pay their tuition in full by Nov. 7 also risked deregistration. On Oct. 3, UQAC postponed the deregistration deadline to Oct. 25. On Oct. 23, more than 700 students attended a special assembly to discuss their rights regarding tuition fees and launched a mobilization committee.\n“It’s time for international students to stop bearing the brunt of policy decisions.”\nAccording to the UQAC student union, MAGE-UQAC, per-term tuition for international students has risen by 12 per cent, from $8,700 to more than $10,000 for some, over the last year. This amounts to an increase of at least $1,500 per term. UQAC denied that this increase was implemented to reduce its deficit.\nOne student from Africa, who has paid almost $40,000 in tuition since September 2023 while completing his masters, shared his experience: “It leaves a bitter taste.. Even ‘less prestigious’ universities don’t treat their students, their ‘clients,’ this way,” he said. The student, who asked to remain anonymous, denounced the lack of transparency from the university administration and MAGE-UQAC by stating: “We’re seeking answers and solutions, but all anyone says is that we should have had our finances in order before we arrived. And yet once we arrived in Canada, we learned that some tuition fees had increased by 16 to 20 per cent without any warning or communication. The fee calculator was removed from the website as we began contesting the increase. International students are once again being treated like cash cows, and it’s taking a toll on [international student] reputation. We’re being scapegoated for everything that’s wrong with the system.” Although not among the deregistered students, he remains concerned for his peers. “People have lost sleep over this. Apart from feeling demotivated, they’re under tremendous stress,” he added.\n“All this begs the question: why was UQAC the only Quebec university that found itself in this position?” asked Alexandre Beaupré-Lavallée, associate professor in higher education administration at Université de Montréal. He added, “even as someone with a good grasp of university financing, some aspects remain unclear. The only explanation I can see is that deregistering these students eases the university’s debt burden, given that it must return $610 to the Ministère de l’Éducation [ministry of education] for every university credit taken by international students.” In fact, UQAC is required to pay that amount to the Quebec government regardless of whether or not the student has paid their tuition fees.\nThe university confirmed that this motivated its decision. “For the current budget year, that is the case,” said Ms. Laflamme, who further explained, “deregistration also prevents the need for more costly administrative measures, like debt collection.”\nThe UQAC website’s section on outstanding account balances (“Comptes en souffrance”) reads, [translation] “It is essential to pay your fees (including any previous outstanding balance) before the payment deadline listed in the university calendar. In the event of non-payment, the university reserves the right to cancel your registration without additional notice or interval.”\nAccording to Dr. Beaupré-Lavallée, “UQAC is the only Quebec university to include this clause in its policy. From my perspective as someone who studies university governance, it seems like UQAC may not have made this unusual policy sufficiently clear; when your institution has a clause that sets you apart, you have to make the effort to communicate it.”\nEducational institutions have no responsibility to financially support their students from abroad, he points out, explaining that “international students are supposed to arrive without need of financial assistance” and that “some universities verify students’ financial means before they arrive.” UQAC, however, runs no such verification.\nThe university clarified that any deregistered students who had already paid part of their tuition for the term were reimbursed and that they could register again in January after full payment of their tuition fees.\nAdjustments may be forthcoming\nAt MAGE-UQAC’s general assembly on Nov. 27, the student community voted in support of the administration’s proposal to stagger tuition fee payments over more than two instalments in the future, but opposed any deregistrations.\nAs they are now deregistered, these students are no longer members of the student union. However, the union will continue to provide support for the students.\nMarie-Lou Bernatchez\nMarie-Lou Bernatchez is a francophone journalist at University Affairs.\nTags\ntuition\nUQAC\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

This is not only for undergraduate students, most of whom are supported by their parents in their native countries and sustain themselves by doing low-paying, odd jobs at the expense of their academic availability. The differential fee principle is also applied to graduate students, who are contributing to the research success of their supervisors, collaborators and departments.\nI have known international graduate students who have spent their nights stocking shelves in grocery stores for extended hours making minimum wage only to fail their courses due to sleep deprivation and be forced to discontinue their academic pursuits. Some of them return to their native countries without fulfilling their dreams and those of their parents and feel disgraced in their communities.\nIn many other countries graduate students are funded by the budgets of universities and/or their national agencies without being charged tuition fees. In Canada, graduate students are supported, at least partially, by their supervisors’ research grants. In a sense, charging a higher fee to an international graduate student is a tax on the supervisor’s often meagre research funds. Those funds could be better spent directly on research by purchasing better equipment or engaging more students, including domestic students.  In my international collaborations, I have met many students from other countries (the U.S. included), who told me that their professors do not have to worry about how their students are supported because the universities took care of that. Alas, our reality is different.\nThe justification for the differential fee that I heard, is that the parents of undergraduate students (or students, themselves) do not pay taxes in Canada and yet gain access to our government-funded educational system. If differential fees are going to be justified on economic grounds such as this, then a more important calculation has been overlooked: these native countries and societies already invested enormous sums of money, time and social capital to raise, nurture and prepare their students for successful professional futures. This investment is an effective transfer of funds to Canadian society and its taxpayers from the home country, at least offsetting those lost tax funds imagined in the argument.\nLike those countries, we also invest in our children from infancy into their late teens to become highly qualified professionals. I don’t have statistics, but I would guess that about 10 to 20 per cent of our youth meet or exceed our expectations. The same percentage may hold for other nations; however, a good portion of this “cream of the crop” is included in the population of international students who are coming to our universities. The selection process of skimming other nations’ talented few through university admissions only helps to enrich the Canadian talent pool. It is time that we reconsider our fee policy and perhaps even discount the tuition for qualified international students. It is in our best interest to be a welcoming place for select, meritorious young people and offer them good academic and financial structures to enhance our own academic communities, while making them feel rewarded. It is good for all of us: institutions, professors and students alike.\nChary Rangacharyulu\nChary Rangacharyulu is a professor of physics and engineering physics at the University of Saskatchewan.\nTags\ntuition\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

With current high levels of political polarization throughout many western democracies, it is useful to consider how instructors from all academic disciplines can support students in developing the knowledge and skills for effective citizenship, which I will refer to as “citizenship development.”\nIn this month’s column, I consider why instructors might want to include citizenship development among learning goals, some of the ways university education advances citizenship, and how instructors and universities might be more deliberate in their efforts.\nThe case for universities and instructors to support citizenship development\nWhy should individual instructors invest time and effort in supporting citizenship development? Some argue that universities have a moral responsibility to do so. For example, 25 years ago, a coalition of almost 1,200 U.S. university and college presidents wrote, “This country cannot afford to educate a generation that acquires knowledge without ever understanding how that knowledge can benefit society or how to influence democratic decision-making.” More recently, in What Universities Owe Democracy, Johns Hopkins University president Ronald J. Daniels argues, “Universities are not merely bystander institutions to democracy but deeply implicated in, and essential for, its success. …. it would be a scandal for them to sit passively by as the political structures aligned with their mission degrade around them.”\nThese advocates also point to more pragmatic reasons. As the presidents’ coalition mentioned above identifies, universities have unique access to adults seeking to advance their understanding of the world: “higher education has an unprecedented opportunity to influence the democratic knowledge, dispositions, and habits of the heart that graduates carry with them into the public square.” Further, universities may have a self-interest in protecting democratic systems – as Mr. Daniels argues – universities are often political targets when democracy is threatened.\nOne challenge that universities and instructors must consider, however, is determining the line between supporting students to develop the tools for effective citizenship (discussed below) and directing them towards particular societal and/or policy outcomes associated with ideological and/or partisan positions. Critics charge that faculty and, in some case, universities writ large are “too woke” or left-leaning. If citizenship development is seen as indoctrinating ideology or supporting particular political positions, it will undoubtedly draw criticism.\nHow universities support citizenship development\nCitizenship development requires that graduates have the knowledge and skills necessary to participate effectively in democratic society.\nDiscussions of citizenship development tend to focus narrowly on building knowledge about government processes, political systems, volunteerism and community engagement – what is often referred to as civic education. Universities make important contributions to civic education through political science, history, law and related disciplinary programs. Further, in our current age of disinformation, it can be argued that scientific literacy contributes to effective citizenship. Thus, universities support citizenship development through science, health, engineering and related disciplinary programs.\nIn addition to building citizenship-relevant knowledge, individual instructors contribute to citizenship development when their teaching includes training and practice in critical thinking, conflict resolution, communication and other human literacy skills. I have written in the past about how instructors can support students to develop intercultural skills (the ability to work with others with different backgrounds), teamwork skills and effective listening skills, and how to understand the limits of data. These skills all contribute to effective citizenship.\nWhat more deliberate approaches to citizenship might look like\nWhile disciplinary education and efforts of individual instructors already support citizenship development, I respectfully suggest that we could be doing a better job of it.\nAt the instructor level, there is an opportunity to reinforce the connection between citizenship and our courses through explicit instruction. We often tell students how particular knowledge and/or skills will be valuable to their professional lives. We can take this further by explaining how particular knowledge and/or skills will be valuable to their civic lives. Instructors can speak to how conflict resolution skills are relevant to civic engagement, how effective listening and communication are necessary for constructive discussions, and how critical thinking is vital to informed public debate. Also at the instructor level, it is also possible to use our classrooms to foster liberal democratic values, such as participation, free speech and respect for diversity of thought. Instructors can have explicit discussion of classroom values and connect these to being an effective community member and citizen.\nAt the institutional level, Mr. Daniels argues “universities need to institute a Democracy Requirement into their curricula.” As a political scientist, I find this idea exciting, but as someone who has served in academic leadership roles for almost a decade, I also find it unlikely to be successful. I also fear that such an approach would relegate citizenship development to a single class that students perceive to be unrelated to their “real” university education.\nInstead, I encourage university administrations to consider how they could adopt a more fulsome citizenship mandate that crosses all disciplines. As Steven Rathgeb Smith writes, “teaching civic engagement and providing resources for a better informed and prepared citizenry cannot be confined to the political science classroom.” Supporting citizenship development across the disciplines could take the form of providing instructors with training and resources on how to develop civic skills in their courses, supporting stronger community engagement opportunities for students to build civic experience, and/or hosting campus-wide discussions about how programs can support citizenship development. Finally, while this column is focused on teaching practice, it is important to note the potential for universities to support citizenship development through research and community engagement.\nUniversities and individual instructors contribute positively to citizenship development, and there is opportunity to do more. A whole university approach to citizenship development would support students in all disciplines in becoming effective, engaged citizens.\nContinuing the Skills Agenda conversation\nWhat role do you see for universities in advancing democratic citizenship? I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below. And for faculty involved in social science and humanities graduate education, please check out my and my coauthors Lisa Young and Jonathan Malloy’s recent book,For the Public Good: Reimagining Arts Graduate Programs in Canadian Universities, and related free Substack newsletter, Reimagining Graduate Education.\nI look forward to hearing from you.

At the event, I saw a demonstration of an AI tool that took an uploaded article and created multiple choice questions in less than a minute. AI can be used to quickly generate elements of course design (learning outcomes, assignment structures, rubrics), lesson planning (lecture slides, case studies, learning activities) and ancillary materials (videos, images, podcasts).\nIt is important to stress the role of the instructor, who must review and, if necessary, revise all Al-generated content. As someone who has spent far too much time labouring over the framing of multiple choice questions and creating just the right slides, I see tremendous potential for saving time. Some of this I was aware of before (see: how Gen-AI can support teaching,with Erin Aspenlieder). But after learning it is possible to have a “syllabot” answer queries about the syllabus, I truly became excited.\nSkill development changes: I learned more about how the changing nature of work and society will transform the skills our students need for success. The ability to formulate and define problems – critical thinking skills universities pride themselves on developing – become more important in an Al environment.\nAt the same time, there will be de-skilling as students are no longer required to use and refine certain skills. This is where we need to be thoughtful and careful. My past abilities to use a microfiche or card catalogue (once necessary for university students) have long fallen into disuse, and despite what my students may think I’m not old enough to have learned how to use an abacus.\nDe-skilling is a normal part of technological evolution. But there are some skills that we need to be mindful to actively protect. At the top of this list is writing. The writing process is important not only for the end product, but for how it allows the writer to uncover, evolve and refine their own thinking. As educators, it is important to be proactive in identifying ways to preserve “writing as thinking”. There are undoubtedly many other skills developed in higher education that we will want to protect from AI replacement.\nPotential for collaboration: There are tremendous opportunities for universities to learn together. Universities in Canada are facing significant financial pressures. They all face the same challenges with adapting to the new AI context.  There is considerable likelihood of unnecessary duplication across the sector as universities work to create protocols, policies and platforms. No one has the answers yet. This could be an opportunity for sector collaboration, be it within provinces, across institutions of similar sizes, or any other configuration.\nAI and higher education: things I question\nFaculty engagement: AI is going to reshape society and the nature of work. This, in turn, is going to challenge universities to respond or be left behind. Are faculty going to be leaders – or, barring that, engaged participants – in determining how AI shapes the future of higher education? Or will they leave this to those outside the sector?  This question concerns me, as I fear we risk creating unsatisfactory AI tools and a rise of outright competitors.\nThere will be no shortage of vendors developing AI products to support higher education. I worry many of these tools will rely on American training data and assume American instructors and students. How might Canadian faculty and universities work with vendors to ensure that Canadian needs, perspectives, and cultural values are informing the AI products we (or our institutions) purchase?\nThere will also be no shortage of vendors developing products to support potential students in circumventing higher education entirely. Ideally, Canadian universities will be able to move quickly to provide compelling alternatives for students. Here, too, faculty engagement is critical. While academic leadership and teaching and learning centres will have important roles to play, faculty leadership in curriculum design is critical.\nOpportunities for liberal education: AI is already changing how we teach, be it through the integration of AI into our classrooms and assessments or the banning of AI use and returning to in-person assessments. But will it also change what we teach?\nAs AI advances, there may be more societal and student demand for human skills (such as intercultural skills, teamwork skills and effective listening skills), for deep understanding of ethics and justice, and for multidisciplinary thinking. If this occurs, will AI create opportunities for the traditional liberal arts (humanities and social sciences), or interdisciplinary programs that include them?\nBroadening beyond the social sciences and humanities to include the STEM disciplines, could AI-related economic and societal changes create more student interest in liberal education programs rather than (or prior to) professional education programs? According to the Association of American Colleges and Universities, liberal education is “[a]n approach to learning that empowers individuals and prepares them to deal with complexity, diversity, and change” that “provides students with broad knowledge of the wider world (e.g., science, culture, and society) as well as in-depth study in a specific area of interest. It helps students develop a sense of social responsibility, as well as strong and transferable intellectual and practical skills such as communication, analytical and problem-solving skills, and a demonstrated ability to apply knowledge and skills in real-world settings.” For faculty who have concerns about a careerist approach to higher education, this would be a welcome development.\nHuman connection: I heard regularly about students’ continuing desire for human connection. This buoys me and rings true with my own experience: I don’t want to speak to a bot or automated system; I want to deal with a human. The importance of human connection and relationships to higher education means that there are, thankfully, limits on what university roles are likely to be replaced by AI. The question is, how can we use AI to support the instructors, advisors, and mentors who are in turn supporting students? How can AI, for example, free up academic advisors’ time so that they have greater availability to meet individually with students?\nAI and higher education: a call to action\nThere are a lot of opportunities, challenges and questions that higher education will need to grapple with as AI becomes more integrated in our economy and society. It is important that we engage in these conversations as a sector. I encourage all of us, regardless of academic position (instructors, leaders, staff) and AI mindset (enthusiast, curious, skeptic), to be part of the conversation.\nContinuing the Skills Agenda conversation\nHow do you feel AI will impact higher education?  I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.\nI look forward to hearing from you. Until next time, stay well, my colleagues.\nLoleen Berdahl\nLoleen Berdahl is a 3M National Teaching Fellow, an award-winning university instructor, the executive director of the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy (Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina), and professor and former head of political studies at the University of Saskatchewan.

From my experience, students who fail their midterms feel the pressure (personal and financial) to pass a course.  Instead of engaging in the hard work required for an essay (reading, writing, and critical thinking), they cheat the process and let AI write the paper for them.  These attempts are still easy to spot, but as AI programs become more and more sophisticated, this will become a serious concern.\nReply\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMost popular\n01\nCareer Advice\nAdvice\nSSHRC Insight and Insight Development Grant\n02\nCareer Advice\nPolicy\nThe limits of graduate professional development\n03\nData vs MAGA\n04\nCareer Advice\nWriting\nTeaching students the connection between writing and thinking\n05\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity News and Careers\nSubscribe\nAD\nAdvertisement\nFlight 302\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity of Ottawa President and Vice Chancellor Marie-Eve Sylvestre\nFeatured Jobs\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Master of Data Analytics)\nUniversity of Niagara Falls Canada\nEducation - (2) Assistant or Associate Professors, Teaching Scholars (Educational Leadership)\nWestern University\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Cybersecurity)\nUniversity of Regina\nVeterinary Medicine - Faculty Position (Large Animal Internal Medicine)\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\nBusiness – Lecturer or Assistant Professor, 2-year term (Strategic Management)\nMcMaster University\nView all jobs\nMore from Opinion\nOpinion\nResearch\nCancelling Congress wounds humanities research\nBudget squeeze and logistical complexities leave the century-old conference without a host.\nby\nMichael Holden\nJune 10, 2025\nOpinion\nMental Health\nNo student is an island\nImproving the collective environment benefits students’ mental health.\nby\nJustine Pineault, François Lauzier-Jobin & Martine Shareck\nJune 06, 2025\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\nPrestigious American universities have long exerted a gravitational pull on Canadian academia.\nby\nFrancois Lachapelle and X.

Canada should go smart instead\nLearning requires struggle, persistence, iteration and deep focus.\nBy\nSimon Bates\nMarch 12, 2025\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nIllustration by Olivia Lennox with sources from Ron Lach, Cottonbro Studio, and Pavel Danilyuk.\n1 Comments\nThe California State University system recently announced the largest-ever deployment of ChatGPT Edu, rolling out AI access to more than 460,000 students and 63,000 faculty and staff across the system. The move is being celebrated as a milestone in higher education’s embrace of artificial intelligence. But there’s a risk in rushing to integrate these tools without first considering what we know about how people actually learn.\nThe promise of generative AI is that it makes things easier. In some cases, much easier. With a few keystrokes, students can generate essays, summarize research papers or complete problem sets that once required hours of work. This frictionless efficiency is intoxicating — but it comes at a cost.\nLearning is not frictionless. It requires struggle, persistence, iteration and deep focus. The risk of a too-hasty full-scale AI adoption in universities is that it offers students a way around that struggle, replacing the hard cognitive labour of learning with quick, polished outputs that do little to build real understanding.\nFor years as a university professor, I’ve watched students’ tolerance for struggle decline. When I started teaching large first-year science courses, I would ask students anonymously how long they typically spent on a difficult problem before giving up. Year after year, the amount of time dropped.\nNow, in an age where solutions are just a prompt away, it’s tempting to not even attempt a problem before turning to AI. This is not a failure of individual students. It’s a reflection of an environment where immediate answers are always within reach. Why wrestle with something difficult when an algorithm can do it for you in seconds?\nWriting offers another example. The act of constructing an argument, refining an idea, wrestling with structure, clarity and argument — this is the real intellectual work of writing.  The finished product is important, but the process is where the learning happens. Offloading that to AI doesn’t just remove effort — it removes the very thinking that makes the challenge of writing a valuable experience to a university student.\nThe biggest danger of AI in education is not that students will cheat. It’s that they will miss the opportunity to build the skills that higher education is meant to cultivate. The ability to persist through complexity, to work through uncertainty, to engage in deep analytical thought — these are the foundations of expertise. They cannot be skipped over.\nThis is why universities need a framework for AI integration that prioritizes learning over efficiency. A recent whitepaper on generative AI in higher education, that I co-authored with Danny Liu at the University of Sydney in collaboration with colleagues from universities across the Pacific Rim, outlines a structured approach to AI adoption. Our framework is built around five key principles: culture, rules, access, familiarity and trust.\nIn short, these principles provide a structured approach to AI adoption, ensuring it is integrated in ways that support student learning rather than undermine it. Culture shapes how AI aligns with a particular higher education institution’s value. Rules establish clear policies on when, how and if AI should be used. Access must be equitable, ensuring students and faculty receive not just access to the technology, but the guidance to use it effectively. Familiarity means structured opportunities to engage with AI critically rather than relying on it blindly. And trust is built through transparency, ethical safeguards and ongoing evaluation of AI’s impact on student learning.\nHere’s what that could look like in practice. At UBC, we’re taking a measured but purposeful approach: supporting experimentation with the tools and support our faculty need; building programming that supports confidence in using the tools effectively and ethically; and listening to our various communities – faculty, staff and students – about what they need and what their concerns are.\nCalifornia State University’s AI rollout reflects a common assumption: that if AI is good, more AI is better. But more isn’t always better in higher education. Canadian universities have an opportunity to take a more thoughtful approach, — one that embraces AI while preserving the struggle of learning. Because real learning comes from wrestling with ideas, not just arriving at answers — and the struggle is what makes it worthwhile.\nSimon Bates\nSimon Bates is vice-provost and associate vice-president for teaching and learning at the University of British Columbia.

Some instructors ban its use outright, considering any use of GenAI to be a form of academic dishonesty. Other instructors embrace its use fully, requiring students to engage with GenAI in their class assignments. Still others avoid the matter entirely by returning to exclusively in-class exams and assessments.\nInstructors who want to retain out-of-class assignments while prohibiting students from using AI in their courses face the challenge of correctly identifying and penalizing AI usage. While detection tools and techniques are available, they present instructors with important practical, ethical and workload challenges that must be considered.\nThe practical limitations of GenAI detection tools\nAfter testing several detection software programs, Australian researchers Daniel Lee and Edward Palmer concluded, “we should assume students will be able to break any AI-detection tools, regardless of their sophistication.” Similarly, business professor Ethan Mollick writes in Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI, “there is no way to detect whether or not a piece of text is AI-generated. A couple of rounds of prompting remove the ability of any detection system to identify AI writing. … Unless you are doing in-class assignments, there is no accurate way of detecting whether work is human-created” (emphasis in original).\nTo be sure, AI detection will catch some students. The students most likely to be caught are those with the least knowledge and/or resources to outsmart detection, meaning some students get away with AI use while others are penalized. Leon Furze writes, “GenAI detection tools privilege students who are English first language, have access to paid large language models/applications, and are more digitally literate” (emphasis in original). The result is potential equity issues with respect to which students are and are not penalized for GenAI use. In the U.S., the Modern Language Association and the Conference on College Composition and Communication jointly urged caution with detection tools to avoid perpetuating inequities: “We urge caution and reflection about the use of AI text detection tools. Any use of them should consider their flaws and the possible effect of false accusations on students, including negative effects that may disproportionately affect marginalized groups.”\nThe ethical questions of GenAI detection tools\nEfforts to detect AI use pose ethical questions for instructors and universities. While some universities use AI-detection software, many universities discourage or prohibit their use due to the risks of both false positives and false negatives, and the inequities created through their use. For example, the University of British Columbia writes:\n“The use of applications to detect AI-generated content is strongly discouraged at this time, due to concerns about effectiveness, accuracy, bias, privacy, and intellectual property. Despite a number of AI writing detectors being available, recent research has found that all fail to perform accurately enough, and accuracy is further reduced when simple obfuscation techniques are used.”\nBeyond AI-detection software, some faculty use a detection method known as “white texting” or “Trojan horse detection” by including in their assignment details small white-font instructions invisible to the human eye that direct AI to include clues (such as mention of a particular false term) in the student’s assignment. Sarah Elaine Eaton, whose research focuses on ethics in higher education, considers this practice unethical. She writes, “Deceptive assessment is a breach of academic integrity on the part of the educator. If we want students to act with integrity, then it is up to educators to model ethical behaviour themselves” (emphasis in original).\nDrawing on Dr. Eaton’s work, Marc Watson writes, “We should set clear guidelines for the use of AI in our courses and likewise hold students accountable when they violate those standards, but that only works when we act ethically. Otherwise, what’s the point? When you resort to deception to try and catch students cheating, you’ve compromised the values of honesty and transparency that come implicitly attached to our profession.”\nThe workload limitations of GenAI detection\nFocusing on AI detection takes up instructor time and increases workloads and stress. As Mr. Furze explains:\nUnlike plagiarism tools, generative AI tools do not give a clear cut result. The percentage likelihood of AI generated content is less accurate than plagiarism detection, more open to interpretation, and therefore requires more consideration on the educator’s part. It requires more nuanced and potentially more stressful conversations between the educator and the student, and the potential for much more kickback from the students and many more appeals. …The added time and stress of using generative AI detection tools is a burden on educators who are already in an industry with a high risk of burnout and attrition. (emphasis in original)\nPolicing student use of GenAI presents a difficult challenge for instructors, with high emotional labour costs. Instructors are put in the position of being suspicious of student work and, as Elizabeth Steere writes, “an accusation based on a false positive can irrevocably damage trust between an instructor and student.”\nEven when AI detection is accurate, its use can create workload stresses if/as students push back against its use. Dr. Eaton argues that unless instructors ensure transparency by clearly stating the use of detection tools in the course syllabus, charges of academic dishonesty are likely to be subject to student challenge: “Students can appeal any misconduct case brought forward with the use of deceptive or undisclosed assessment tools or technology (and quite frankly, they would probably win the appeal)” (emphasis in original).\nSo now what?\nGiven the limits of detection approaches, what are instructors to do? For some, as noted earlier, the solution is a return to in-class exams and assessments, practices that have their own challenges with respect to equity and inclusion. For others, the solution is to find ways to engage with GenAI and to help students embrace transparency in its use. As Dr. Steere writes, “Perhaps as we work to integrate it meaningfully and ethically, and teach students how to cite its use, students will feel less compelled to disguise AI-generated writing.”\nBut for many instructors, neither of these models is appealing. For instructors who plan to use detection tools, it is necessary to be transparent with students about the use of the tools, thoughtful about the biases inherent in them and sensitive to the student stress associated with accusations of academic dishonesty. Other instructors will find it helpful to instead have open dialogue with students about why they prohibit GenAI use in their classes, how they define academic integrity, and how they plan to enforce it. (See Gianluca Agostinelli’s tips for fostering critical thinking and original writing in an AI-context.)\nGenAI has disrupted higher education. Responses to it will continue to evolve over the years ahead as instructors continue to rethink and reimagine pedagogies and assessments. The key, as the Modern Language Association and the Conference on College Composition and Communication writes, is for “educators to respond out of a sense of our own strengths rather than operating out of fear”.\nContinuing the Skills Agenda conversation\nWhat is your own approach to GenAI use in your classroom?

True, some colleagues are excited about the creative potential of these new technologies, and by the role they might play in making education more accessible for disabled students and students learning in an additional language. But much more common is the complaint that students are using GenAI in dishonest ways that compromise their learning (not to mention creating a huge burden on professors, TAs and investigating deans).\nHaving a better understanding of why students are turning to GenAI to write their assignments can help universities more effectively reinforce academic integrity without unjustly disadvantaging the most vulnerable students.\n“For students who are poor, short on time, and desperate to make the grade, the frictionlessness of GenAI can be the tipping point between academic integrity and academic misconduct.”\nStudies reveal two main factors associated with student cheating. First, students are more likely to cheat when they are extrinsically rather than intrinsically motivated – for instance, when they are taking a course to satisfy a program requirement rather than out of curiosity about the course material. (If you have ever gamed your university’s online cybersecurity or hazardous materials course in order to tick the box with HR and stop receiving annoying reminder emails, you understand first-hand that extrinsic motivation can lead to corner-cutting.) Second, when students perceive cheating as common among their peers, they feel pressure to cheat too, in order to keep up. These two factors reflect, not bad eggs, but students making regrettable choices about how to allocate their available time and how to mitigate perceived risks.\nThese decisions are further affected by socio-economic, family or immigration status. A student who has to work 30 hours a week to stay above water or who has heavy family caring responsibilities needs to use their time very strategically. Again, this can lead to corner-cutting, especially for courses and assessments for which the student lacks intrinsic motivation. Similarly, an international student struggling academically risks losing their visa if they fail enough courses. They might take a chance on cheating as a way of mitigating that risk. The more desperate students become, the more pressure they feel to just pass the course by any means necessary.\n“Like COVID-19, GenAI is with us to stay.”\nWe should therefore expect that non-traditional students, including low-income students, adult learners and international students disproportionately number among those accused of academic dishonesty. Further, there is evidence that racialized international students (for instance, Asian and African students, as opposed to white students from Australia or the U.K.) are over-reported for academic misconduct. When making a judgment call about an assessment’s academic integrity, some academic staff may be influenced by bias.\nGenAI exploits these challenges. Buying a paper from an “essay mill” is much more expensive and much slower than getting ChatGPT to write your assignment. For students who are poor, short on time, and desperate to make the grade, the frictionlessness of GenAI can be the tipping point between academic integrity and academic misconduct.\nI’m not proposing a laissez-faire approach to the rash of GenAI academic misconduct we are seeing. Universities need to defend academic integrity – both to ensure the fidelity of the academic credentials we grant and to protect students from a culture of cheating and the corresponding pressure to cheat. At the same time, we need to ensure that we are not further disadvantaging non-traditional students.\nUniversities’ approach to academic integrity should be holistic – not only a set of processes for reporting, investigation and punishment, but also upstream interventions that target the reasons students cheat. Here are a couple of examples: better student funding and childcare can buy students enough time to do the work themselves; well-designed curricula can reduce the box-ticking that produces extrinsic motivation. Downstream, student discipline processes should be trauma-informed, equitable and proportionate. In Canada, theft of under $5,000 does not result in deportation, but an academic misconduct finding on an assessment worth 10 per cent of a course grade can lead to a student losing their visa. As a sector, we need to rethink our student discipline systems and build in approaches that provide students a path back from misconduct.\nWhen COVID-19 hit, the whole sector turned on a dime so that students could keep learning. We need to do the same with this latest “pandemic.” Like COVID-19, GenAI is with us to stay.\nShannon Dea\nShannon Dea is the dean of arts and a professor of philosophy at the University of Regina.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

[Eds]. 2024. Palgrave Macmillan.) is a valuable open access resource for university administrators, faculty, staff and policymakers navigating the complexities of artificial intelligence as it provides a balanced view of AI’s potential and pitfalls specifically in educational contexts.\nIn just 192 pages, editors Alex Urmeneta and Margarida Romero deliver a succinct and comprehensive exploration of AI use cases in  elementary, secondary and postsecondary environments, including applications in vocational training and administrative functions.\nMany of the contributors and case studies in the book draw from European perspectives, but the central issues and questions are relevant in our North American context.\nThe book identifies several risks associated with AI in education, including the potential reduction in agency, choice and decision-making autonomy for teachers and students. The contributors caution against the decline in critical skills due to overreliance on AI systems, and highlight ethical concerns related to surveillance, data privacy, bias and accountability.\nOn the positive side, the book notes the benefits of AI in automating routine tasks, allowing teachers to focus on more meaningful interactions with students. It also discusses the potential of AI to enhance language learning, provide personalized feedback, and support dynamic learning environments through AI integration in game-based learning and simulations.\nHowever, the primary theme of the book is the importance of preserving human agency and ensuring transparency in the deployment of AI applications in education settings. Contributors emphasize the need for critical engagement with AI tools in education, predicated on a strong foundation of technical training and AI literacy. The authors advocate for a thoughtful integration of AI, emphasizing hybrid intelligence, where AI complements rather than replaces human intelligence. The book introduces useful frameworks such as the passive participatory model of AI and digital acculturation, which help educators understand how AI engagement and integration may progress.\nThe contributors also provide several important recommendations for educators and policymakers, in addition to their focus on preserving human agency in AI applications. These include:\nTransparency: Clear communication about how AI-generated content and feedback are produced.\nFormative assessment: Using AI for ongoing, formative assessments rather than high-stakes summative evaluations.\nAI literacy training: Educators and students should be trained to understand AI’s capabilities and limitations so that they can engage critically with the technology.\nEthical guidelines: Developing robust ethical frameworks to guide AI integration in education.\nAll recommendations emphasize the role of senior academic leaders in governance and operational aspects of AI deployment. It is critical that leaders establish policies and protocols to ensure transparency, accountability, security and equitable access. A focus on training and ongoing support for users to enhance AI literacy and skill development is essential for successful AI integration in teaching, learning, research, and administrative contexts.\nUnderscoring the central importance of human judgment, wisdom, and relationships in education, Creative Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Education is a timely contribution to the ongoing discourse on AI in education. Ultimately, the contributing authors advocate for a human-centred approach to the applications of AI, showcasing multiple ways that AI can enhance educational outcomes and preserve the essential human elements of teaching and learning.\nEmily Tufts is the University Librarian at Trent University.\nEmily Tufts\nEmily Tufts is the University Librarian at Trent University.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

But given the gaps in our common understanding of the way science and research contribute to productivity and prosperity in our communities, the worry may also be ill-informed.\nIn fact, evidence suggests that mission-oriented research and innovation have a central place in the support system for science we need to tackle wicked problems and global challenges, and to create economic and societal well-being. This is the motivation behind the Canadian Forum for Social Innovation, the third edition of which will take place at Dalhousie University in Halifax next week, 2-4 June.\nCritics worry that mission-oriented innovation will tip the balance between the funding that goes toward fundamental research versus applied research in favour of the latter. Assuredly, we need more money for all science. Canada’s current investment in science is strikingly lower than the OECD average (2.7 per cent of GDP), and equivalent to that of Czechia (1.8 per cent of GDP). But should the proportion of funding directed toward projects that leave scientists with the freedom to pursue their own objectives be higher than the proportion whose objectives are set by other means — and, if so, why?\nSome argue that academic freedom is indissociable from the idea that fundamental science is good in itself, and that curiosity-driven scientists are in the best position to determine which questions and problems they should be tackling. The prospect of government making choices as to what has value for science raises concerns.\nBut mission-oriented innovation policy does not need to depend on government priorities. In some countries, missions are prioritized through extensive citizen and stakeholder consultations, and through processes that involve the research community.  This is the case in Sweden’s innovation agency, Vivonna, which employs collective agenda-setting and mission co-definition. In fact, Mark Carney’s Liberals ran on a platform that reconfirmed the creation of a capstone organization that would enable mission-driven research that brings Canadian expertise to big global challenges and is aligned with current trends in Europe and the UK.\nLikewise, it’s not clear to me how an approach to science primarily designed to support high levels of interdisciplinary collaboration around societal priorities — and to engage stakeholders in co-creation, deliberation and consultation — would compromise academic freedom.\nThe real issue, in my opinion, is that mission-driven innovation policy challenges current academic norms at their core: It is inherently interdisciplinary; adamantly focused on collaboration with partners across sectors; and driven by an imperative to generate meaningful impact for all those involved. It furiously and intentionally blurs traditional lines between researchers, funders and stakeholders to shape both the supply and the demand sides of research.\nMission-driven research — which often shows up under the label of “social innovation” —requires investigators and their teams to frame research questions in a way that does justice to the perspectives of all those involved, especially the users of the research and knowledge. It leverages interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral expertise, knowledge, best practices and tools. It establishes co-creation as a core principle, involving adequate and often iterative prototyping and testing. It forces investigators to articulate the intended impact of their work, and to co-operate with partners to move beyond research and see ideas, tools and solutions put to meaningful use.\nLet it be clear: Canada’s investment in research and higher education needs to grow, but it also needs to transform the way we do science, and this requires researchers to think beyond the current paradigms. Mission-oriented research enables scientists to tackle societal challenges across entire ecosystems and to support industrial strategies designed to create not only personal or corporate revenue, but prosperity for entire communities.\nWhen it comes to responding to mounting inequalities, the opioid crisis, the exponential development of AI and the global need for sustainable housing and transportation, curiosity and discovery cannot be the sole values that drive our science strategy. Solutions to these complex issues require intentional, well-planned interdisciplinary collaboration within the scientific community and strong connectivity with those who use the research, and society at large.\nSandra Lapointe\nTags\nInnovation\nresearch\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

And they were drawing the connections between them and our course content on intercultural communication,” says Dr. Garbati, assistant professor, teaching stream at the Institute for the Study of University Pedagogy.\nDr. Garbati’s 80-year-old father, a non-native English speaker, often used emojis but she knew many of his peers did not feel as comfortable. Meanwhile, everyone she spoke with on the topic, especially young people, became excited. Yet, emojis did not feature prominently in any course at U of T. “This is what students are interested in,” she realized, and came up with an idea for the course.\n“And I’m interested it,” she adds. “It brings together my knowledge and interest in language learning, language development, writing studies and business communication.”\nHer students gave the plan a thumbs-up — at least metaphorically, and likely, literally — and the university quickly approved Emoji Rhetoric: A New Paradigm in Communication. In January 2025, she offered the course to 25 students and launched the Symbolic Communication Research Lab as a vehicle to focus her research on the topic.\nThere’s much to teach, including where emojis originate. They evolved from use of emoticons beginning in the 1980s, which use keystrokes to represent facial expressions such as happy faces (: )) and winks (;-)) Highly sophisticated Japanese kaomoji emerged around the same time, which emphasize eyes and are read vertically. For instance, one kaomoji for sadness is ╯_╰.\nEmojis are now a click away on your computer (💻) or phone (📱) because the non-profit Unicode Consortium sets a universal character standard for digital text, including how to code emojis. It has approved over 3,700 symbols that software developers embed into their products, allowing you to text an image from your iPhone to your friend on an Android, who can reply with the exact same image. You can also generate your own image any time via an AI emoji generator — but it won’t then appear on your computer’s character menu.\nIn class, Dr. Garbati shares the interesting but highly unreadable book Emoji Dick, a translation of Moby Dick … in emoji. Assignments include students using the tenets of rhetoric to argue for the inclusion of a new emoji in the universal standard. (A steel pan drum and a messy-hair face were suggested this term.) The final assignment has students research an emoji in a discipline of personal interest, such as business, anthropology or medicine.\nDr. Garbati says there is plenty of research for her lab to build on, in a range of disciplines. For example, four undergraduate students scanned social media usage during the 2024 Super Bowl. They analyzed over 5,300 tweets and found the top emojis used were 🏈 😭 and ❤️. (One student knew a lot about football and another could identify imagery of Taylor Swift – who attended the event – both of which were immensely valuable, says Dr. Garbati.)\nAn upcoming study will see how luxury brands use emojis and if their customers are aligned with the same approach, as emojis are often used in business communication. “We think it’s just for young kids or social media or our smartphones, but we’re seeing it in emails, in newsletters.” A different collaboration with U of T biology researchers will look at how birdwatchers use them to communicate with each other.\nDr. Garbati’s academic background — with two degrees in education, a doctorate in applied linguistics and an MBA — makes her well-suited to teaching about emojis at the university level. Still, she finds her new area of study surprising.\n“I feel like I stumbled on this. I could never have predicted that this is where my teaching and research would go.”\nDiane Peters\nDiane Peters is a Toronto-based writer and editor.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Such events can be national, international, local, or just affect one organization. They can include floods, fires, crashes, product malfunctions, disease outbreaks and mass murders.\nNatural disasters are on the rise, with Statistics Canada reporting in October 2024 that the year was already the costliest ever for weather-related insurance payouts. So, more universities in Canada are offering programs in disaster studies and emergency management. These programs train people to be emergency managers, policy makers, or business continuity experts, and contribute to research in an interdisciplinary, applied and increasingly busy field.\nYork University is the most recent to join the fray. It recently launched a PhD program in the field of disaster studies, with the first cohort starting in fall 2025.\n“We want to push the boundaries of knowledge of disaster and emergency management,” said Aaida Mamuji, director of the graduate program in disaster and emergency management. “There are not many programs in this field [in Canada]. We’re helping to grow the community. It’s necessary. Disasters are increasing in severity, frequency and complexity.”\nYork also runs undergraduate, master’s and certificate programs in this field of study. Other universities offer a variety of options as well: Brandon University (BU) in Manitoba offers an undergraduate degree and Royal Roads University in Victoria has master’s and graduate diploma options available. Both Toronto Metropolitan University and University of Victoria offer certificates through their continuing education departments. The Université du Québec à Montréal offers a postgraduate diploma, plus operates the Canadian Research Institute on Humanitarian Crises and Aid (OCCAH).\nThis niche field of research was actually started in Canada. In 1920, Samuel Henry Prince of New Brunswick published the book Catastrophe and Social Change about the Halifax explosion, which was based on his PhD work being done at Columbia University. It is now considered the first systematic study of disaster.\nThen, not a whole lot happened for more than 80 years. In early September 2001, Jack Lindsay, associate professor in the applied disaster and emergency studies program at BU, taught one of the first-ever classes focused on disasters in the country. There were no other comparable offerings in Canada, and just a handful around the world. A week later, the field changed forever.\n“Sept. 11 really kicked it off. The money started flowing,” he said, noting that some U.S. programs even changed their names to add in phrases such as “homeland security” to attract philanthropic dollars and money via the likes of the Emergency Management Institute (FEMA). A 2003 study counted 89 emergency management programs in the U.S. up from five total in 1995.\nNowadays, there are hundreds of programs in the U.S., with 23 doctoral programs alone. In Canada, polytechnics and colleges offer first responder-focused training in emergency management while university programs blend management-level practical training with theory.\n“Our applied skills are around writing briefing notes for government ministers or how to prepare public awareness campaigns,” said Mr. Lindsay.\nCourses tend to span emergency management — based around four pillars: mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery — risk assessment, law, public health, social impact and business continuity. Programs may delve into urban planning, communications, environmental science and gender. Most degrees involve research projects and internships.\nBU markets its program as a practical degree to train emergency managers, for leadership roles in the growing profession of emergency management, and for a whole slew of government and private sector jobs that tackle emergency and risk management and planning. For instance, Mr. Lindsay – who studied urban planning – was the emergency manager during the 1998 Auckland power crisis, where the core of the city had no power for six weeks. He also spoke to the Ottawa People’s Commission, which had to deal with the Ottawa convoy protests in 2022, about how to avoid declaring a state of emergency.\nRoyal Roads president and vice-chancellor Philip Steenkamp said its disaster and management graduate programs, which were launched in 2006, are influenced by conflict studies, its master’s in climate action leadership and its resilience by design lab, a climate change research initiative.\nThe university seeks to connect to the labour market, so professionals come to level up for roles in the military, government, Indigenous leadership and corporate communications, but gain big-picture knowledge, too. “These programs look at disaster and emergency management from the complex social and ethical dimensions of disasters. [They focus] on how different cultural, social and policy factors can shape emergency management,” said Dr. Steenkamp.\nAt York, the programs reside in administrative studies, so students often explore business courses, but it’s otherwise highly interdisciplinary. Associate professor Dr. Mamuji has a PhD in public administration, during which she studied how Canada offers humanitarian aid to other countries during times of crisis. Her more recent work has looked at disability-inclusive disaster management during flooding in Muskoka and how minority groups fared during the 2016 Fort McMurray wildfires. Her colleagues specialize in studying flooding, wildfires and remote sensing.\nLaunched in 2007, York’s master’s program prioritizes research. It was followed by the undergraduate degree two years later, and now a new PhD program. The university also provides opportunities for partnerships via its collaboration for emergency management, policy, and preparedness research lab.\nDisasters impact many fields, including journalism, so Sean Holman, the Wayne Crookes Professor of Environmental and Climate Journalism at UVic’s writing department, launched the Climate Disaster Project in 2021.\nIt started as a course and has now expanded internationally to train more than 230 writing students in a trauma-informed approach to interviewing survivors of climate events and getting informed consent to publish their as-told-to stories. “It allows students to not just report on disasters and work with survivors effectively, but it allows them to work with lots of different kinds of difficult knowledge and people who have experienced a range of humanitarian crises,” said Mr. Holman.\nAs disasters escalate, so does demand for people who can help prevent, manage and recover from them, who can provide best practices via academic research.\n“We need more programs, and we need to spread the word more,” said Dr. Mamuji, who sees demand for people with training at all degree levels. “We don’t have enough to build this community of experts in disaster emergency management. There are positions opening up everywhere and not enough people have this academic grounding in the field. There’s definitely a need.”\nDiane Peters\nDiane Peters is a Toronto-based writer and editor.\nTags\nBrandon University\nToronto Metropolitan University\nUniversité du Québec à Montréal\nUniversity of Victoria\nYork University\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

They reminded Dr. Tettey, who began serving as the university’s 17th president on New Year’s Day, of his own academic path — an irrepressible drive to use the post-secondary experience to shape a more equitable and sustainable future.\n“Students have always been at the heart of what universities do,” says Dr. Tettey, “and after spending a short amount of time with Carleton students, getting a feel for the work that is happening here, I can already see that they’re going to advance Canada and the world in new and innovative ways.\n“Our role as an institution is to nurture and cultivate ideas and people, but students are particularly regenerative. They come here with a broad range of experiences and challenge us to rethink how we do things.”\nAn inclusive entrepreneurial mindset\nDr. Tettey started going to school in a lower-class neighbourhood in Accra, the capital and largest city in Ghana — a place that many people consider the “margin of the margins,” he says.\nEven though his mother did not have formal schooling, she was a staunch believer in the power of education. Tettey had regular access to newspapers and the household was a vibrant gathering place for intellectual engagement with older siblings, cousins and friends who loved to debate, showing young Wisdom that curiosity and ideas could expand his world.\n“Education can open so many doors,” he says. “It’s one of those areas where you’re not encumbered by other people’s perceptions of what you should be. You might be sitting in a classroom with people who are economically better off than you, but what matters is your critical engagement with knowledge.\n“Coming to Carleton, I’m excited about helping to give people the chance to be in a space where we can grow to be our best selves and make valuable contributions to society.”\nDr. Tettey has promoted excellence at every institution that he has been part of over the years and notes that this outcome is deepened and expanded by a mutually reinforcing commitment to equity and inclusion.\n“There’s always an opportunity to learn and grow,” he says, “because you can always continue to push the boundaries of knowledge. But, more importantly, we can make a more meaningful and positive impact on society by intentionally fostering a learning and scholarly environment where excellence, equity and inclusion enrich one another.”\nThis approach to education, he says, should be one of the fundamental missions of universities, and the Carleton community’s commitment to it is what intrigued Dr. Tettey upon discovering that the university was looking for a new president.\n“I asked myself, is this a place where I can do the things that I believe in? Does it have the fundamental values and principles that undergird my own motivations?” The move to Carleton, he adds, was the result of a “bidirectional” decision making process.\n“There are tremendous opportunities for Carleton, and also an opportunity for me to continue to grow and contribute in ways that I might not have been able to previously. There’s a stimulating, enriching environment that I can draw from.\n“Relative to other places, Carleton is not as constrained by inflexible ways of doing things,” he continues. “It has a nimbleness, an entrepreneurial mindset and a spirit of innovation that are purposefully inclusive. I want to be part of this adventure.”\nMaintaining the momentum\nOne of Dr. Tettey’s priorities at Carleton will be to enhance the university’s renowned student experience, ensuring that the learning environment is as robust and supportive as possible.\n“We need to have the structures in place,” he says, “so our graduates can be conscientious and adaptable citizens and leaders, whoever they are and wherever they go.”\nAs a globally oriented institution, Carleton is well situated, Dr. Tettey says, to bring the world to campus, whether through research or partnerships or pedagogy. And the university is also poised to radiate out into other spaces to drive intellectual advancement, innovation and community impact.\nThis means, for example, leveraging Carleton’s location in the national capital to promote regional and international partnerships, including expanding the university’s presence in Kanata North, the largest research and technology hub in Canada.\n“These are the types of actions we can take to elevate our institution,” he says. “This is the journey that will lead to great outcomes for society.”\nAD\nAdvertisement\nDan Rubinstein\nDan Rubinstein is the senior writer at Carleton University and the author of Water Borne, forthcoming in June 2025 from ECW Press.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

These decisions are compounded by the rapidly evolving expectations of students, underpinning the crises in the postsecondary market, showing that there is a clear and urgent need for a seamless integration of AI into the student experience sooner rather than later.\nThat’s why, in this year’s Global Student Wellbeing Survey (with responses from 10,189 students), conducted by Studiosity in partnership with YouGov, we sought to understand student expectations regarding AI-based support, among other key indicators to support educators with the months ahead. Here are some of the themes that emerged from the survey results:\n1. Student expect AI support tools\nThe majority (54 per cent) of Canadian students expect their university to offer AI support tools. Notably, students who have been traditionally underrepresented and in some cases who report being under-supported are more likely to expect their university to offer AI support tools. For instance, of students who are also caregivers, 72 per cent expect to be provided with AI support tools.\nOther groups for whom the majority expect AI support include: part-time students, students in any level of employment, students achieving middle-to-lower range grades (below 83 per cent), students for whom English is an additional language, all age groups (except 42-49), international students, and male students.\n2. Students are motivated by stress, time, and money\nCanadian students who felt regularly stressed in some way during their degree had the strongest expectations for AI support tools from their university. The biggest reasons for stress were “Not having enough time” and “Paying for my degree/study,” which may have a correlation with the expectation for more support and may be an area of further research.\nThe higher the students’ reported grade, the more likely they prioritized “speed” as a reason for needing AI support over improving grades; then, as a students’ reported grade fell, the importance of AI support for “grades” rose. This trend stops at students achieving a “Pass” grade, who prioritized speed and “avoiding embarrassment from a real person” as reasons for using AI support.\n3. Students believe their university could be moving faster to adapt to AI technology\nAlarmingly, 60 per cent of Canadian students believe their universities are not adapting quickly enough to include AI support tools. Similar sentiments are echoed globally, with 55 per cent in Australia and 64 per cent in the U.K. sharing this perception. This trend was reflected across all ages, genders, reported grades, year levels, and domestic or international status.\nWhat’s next?\nWith more than 100 meetings with postsecondary leaders in the past six months, I have heard first-hand the interest and dedication of Canadian leaders and educators to support their students’ demands for accessibility, convenience, trust, and speed of feedback.\nEthics, student learning, transparency, sustainability at scale and AI that enables connection to university services and peers are always top of the agenda in these meetings. It’s no coincidence that the AI-powered Studiosity enables all of this, because it is a rare instance of generative AI built in collaboration with, and for, the post-secondary education sector exclusively, and not as an afterthought.\nAs the education landscape comes around to embracing the age of AI, we look forward to watching Canadian universities take charge of what they will – and will not – accept for their students and staff, and demanding more evidence, ethics, transparency of outcomes, and integration into wider teaching and learning ecosystems in a way that lifts community and belonging. Fortunately, educators are good at demanding evidence, what students need to see are leaders responding to calls – from both students and staff – to instigate change, to provide more accessible, faster support, and to navigate this urgent crossroads in the Canadian post-secondary sector.\nBased on my calendar, the next few months promise to be just as busy as I continue to meet with postsecondary leaders about Studiosity+, and I can already see a trend of student-centric, fast-growing colleges setting the example and pace for the necessary adoption of ethical, scaled AI-for-learning in the fall.\nChris Helsby is vice-president for Canada at Studiosity, which provides ethical and accessible AI-powered academic feedback and study help, while also delivering powerful peer connection at scale. Studiosity partners with more than 200 postsecondary institutions in Canada, the U.K., Australia, and New Zealand.\nChris Helsby\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Since President Donald Trump’s election in November 2024, they had been duplicating government web pages, interactive tools and datasets in case the new administration decided to change, delete or irretrievably conceal them.\nBy the end of January, about 2,000 pages had gone missing from the total inventory of about 310,000 pages on U.S. federal government websites. “That’s 2,000 missed opportunities; 2,000 things that people won’t find there anymore,” says Eric Nost, associate professor of geography, environment and geomatics at the University of Guelph.\nThen, in a January 20 order, the U.S. government directed all federal agencies to acknowledge only two biological sexes and to “remove all … internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.” Information such as the results of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey were taken down — although that particular page was later restored after a court order, with a disclaimer stating that the administration rejects its contents.\nIt’s normal for government digital materials to change as they are revised or become redundant. When new governments come in, more rewrites and deletions happen, often reflecting the agenda of the administration. “The surprising thing here has been the scope and speed of these changes,” says Dr. Nost.\nDr. Nost works with the U.S.-based Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI), a group formed in 2016 during the first Trump administration whose mission includes safeguarding vulnerable environmental data. “We saw fairly significant efforts to change website language and the way issues such as climate change and energy were described,” Dr. Nost says of President Trump’s first term, adding that datasets were largely left untouched at that time. “This time around, the scope of changes is much wider.”\nRecently, Dr. Nost has been duplicating interactive tools used to access datasets, including the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, which was taken down on January 22. He helped recreate the interactive map and repost it on the site of a climate group.\nWhile Dr. Nost is Canadian and the data is American, it’s hugely important to him and to his colleagues. “The U.S. federal government is the world’s largest publisher of information,” he says. Kristi Thompson, research data management librarian at Western University, noted, “People go to their data because they have great, detailed data sets. A lot of Canadian research and worldwide research is based on those sets.”\nConcerns in Canada\nMs. Thompson is part of group of about 50 people with the newly hatched Canadian Data Rescue Project, which is backing up minor government department sites. “There is a clear assault on public data and public knowledge going on in the United States,” she says. “If you destroy the trust in public data collection, that’s significant. And I’m concerned the same thing could happen in Canada.”\nPrior to the Canadian federal election in April 2025, Katie Cuyler, open publishing and government information librarian at the University of Alberta, was doing her part to safeguard information as part of the End of Session Archive conducted by Internet Archive Canada. “The vibe is chaotic and uncertain,” she said of that time.\nEstablished in 2004, Internet Archives Canada is affiliated with California-based Internet Archive, which digitizes books and preserves old versions of websites on its Wayback Machine. One of the first digital preservation initiatives, the Internet Archive dates to 1996, when the Internet itself was growing and becoming increasingly accessible. Like newspapers, the content published on the web was ephemeral — but unlike newspapers, no one was saving it.\nMore groups and projects started in 2008, with elections on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border in a digital era. Libraries, which used to keep paper copies of government documents, had begun making virtual backups. In the U.S. the End of Term Web Archive launched, while Internet Archive Canada began backing up government data.\nIn 2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Conservative government abolished the long-form census. In 2012, it defunded of the First Nations Statistical Institute and closed a slew of federal government libraries. In response, a group of committed library professionals launched the Canadian Government Information Digital Preservation Network (CGI-DPN). “What happened in 2012 really lit a fire,” says Ms. Cuyler.\nFinding better ways to save\nThere are a dizzying number of groups and projects tackling the preservation of vast amounts of tough-to-track information. “What’s freaky about datasets is when they’re gone, they’re just gone. You’re relying on other things to know they even existed,” says Ms. Thompson.\nNow, those doing this work are seeking to improve their protocols. “While the data does not go away, it becomes harder to access,” says Matt Price, assistant professor of history at the University of Toronto, who works with EDGI. “We’ve had initiatives to back up dataset but nobody ever used the data. It was like we took the family inheritance and put it into big glass jars and buried it in the backyard.”\nThere’s a push to establish common repositories and to ensure that academics, librarians, students and the public know where to find them. The Wayback Machine is well-known, and librarians are promoting the repository Borealis, a partnership of numerous university libraries hosted at U of T, which contains materials such as agricultural and environmental datasets.\nAs well, saved information needs care over time, says Andrea Mills, executive director, Internet Archive Canada. “Some of the government documents that we have digitized are almost 20 years. We have to go back and do the optical character recognition over again, improving formats and leveraging new technology.”\nBig tech risks\nDr. Price struggles with storing materials on cloud platforms run by tech giants such as Google and Amazon Web Services, some of which offer in-kind donations to U.S. data-backup groups. According to CNN, Amazon and Google each donated $1 million to President Trump’s inaugural fund. “I think we should be careful. We should recognize that we are entrusting important work to untrustworthy actors,” Dr. Price says.\nIn a perfect world, Canada would collect more of its own data, and the safety of evidence-based materials would be carefully protected here and elsewhere. For now, there’s backing up, coding, collaborating and hoping for the best. “This is a stressful time,” says Ms. Cuyler, “and a reminder that democracy takes a lot of work.”\nDiane Peters\nDiane Peters is a Toronto-based writer and editor.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

I think I’ve done enough to meet the standards outlined in my faculty agreement, but I’m anticipating that it’ll be hard for me to show that in my research-intensive institution (even though they have produced some language that sounds like DORA). What advice for you have for those of us applying for tenure but not interested in demonstrating ‘impact’ through h-index or JIF?\n– Anonymous, Labour Studies\nAnswer:\nAs you may already know, dear letter-writer, the San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) states that institutions should “consider a broad range of impact measures including qualitative indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy and practice,” and that individual researchers should “use a range of article metrics and indicators” when your work is being assessed (DORA, n.d.).\nBut what are these impact measures, article metrics and indicators?\nBack in 2021, I shared three options, but in the ever-changing landscape of research assessment, it’s time to explore some new possibilities. To learn more about the approaches available to you when you go up for promotion and tenure, I spoke with Dr. Max Liboiron, professor of geography at Memorial University of Newfoundland and Labrador, and with Dr. Kyle Demes, the chief operating officer at the not-for-profit OurResearch. Some of their favourite strategies for demonstrating the influence and impact of your research include:\nTracing your impact on national and international policy\nResearchers whose work may be of interest to policymakers should look themselves up in Sage Policy Profiles to identify where their work has been cited in policy documents. Once you enter your name and ORCiD number, the website shows you recent policy documents in which your work has been cited and maps the prevalence of those citations globally. For researchers who need to demonstrate the international influence of their work, this tool can be an asset.\nIf you know you’ve been influential outside of academia, but Sage Policy Profiles isn’t yielding results, then Deakin University’s excellent Research Metrics Toolkit — and specifically its suggested metrics for measuring relevance — may help you to figure out how to quantify your ability to shape professional practices, policy public, industry standards or educational curricula.\nDemonstrating the reach of your diverse outputs\nOpenAlex is an open-access bibliographic database that provides statistics at the level of the researcher and the output, and includes in its ever-growing corpus journal articles, datasets, reports, standards, reference entries, editorials, and — increasingly — books and book chapters, which have historically been excluded from citation counts.\nIf you share open data, OpenAlex will help you to trace its use in subsequent studies; if you work on populations in the Global South, you can see whether researchers in the Global South are citing your work; if you publish in French, or are cited in French-language publications, you’re likely to see those publications represented in OpenAlex’s corpus, whereas you might not find them via another platform.\n“We’ve known for decades that journals are not the only type of research output, but people have focused on articles for practical reasons,” Dr. Demes told me. OpenAlex is striving “to be as inclusive as possible, to make research information discoverable, accessible, appropriately linked, so that it can be drawn on and used”— including by telling a more complete story of the resonance of your work in subsequent publications.\nPutting publication metrics in context\nAt some institutions, you just have to include metrics related to publications. If you’re told — or if you have good reason to believe — that your reviewers will look up your publication metrics whether or not you include them, then I suggest including them and providing substantial context.\nFor example, if you think you need to include your h-index (despite its well-documented flaws), see if there are any published benchmarking studies that show the average citation count of early- and mid-career faculty in your discipline. Might you argue that, although still an assistant professor, you already have an h-index that falls within the average range of an associate professor in your field?\nIf no such benchmarking publication exists, you might consider showing the Field Weighted Citation Impact of some of your most significant publications, to show that your work is cited at a higher rate than similar publications: a FWCI score of 1.00 suggests that your work is being cited at a rate identical to similar publications, while a FWCI score of 10.00 says your work is being cited 10 times as often as other similar works. Because FWCI hasn’t yet gained the same traction as h-index, however, your reviewers may not be familiar with it, and so may be skeptical: researchers in New Zealand found “a mistrust around the complicated calculation of” the FWIC, noting that, despite their interviewees’ awareness of the limitations of the h-index, “they would be likely to still use h-index over other metrics” (Chivers et al., 2023).\nWhile any number of free and for-pay tools can show you citation metrics — Scopus, Google Scholar, SciVal — I’m personally most likely to turn to OpenAlex, and not just because I like that they’re aligned with, and indeed advancing, the open science movement. I also like that OpenAlex is providing FWCI based on the content in your individual article, rather than on the subject area of the journal. “The journal in which you publish does not necessarily equate to the quality of your work,” Dr. Demes reminded me — which is why I’m a fan of OpenAlex’s approach.\nShowing growth over time\nWhile most of the above metrics give a static picture of your work at the time you compile your dossier, Dr. Liboiron prefers visualizations that allow you to compare your present work to your prior work. “Exploring your own research trajectory through trends over time is really powerful,” Dr. Liboiron told me. For example, in their tenure dossier, in addition to line graphs demonstrating increases in publications and grant dollars, Dr. Liboiron also visually represented media coverage of their research:\nIn their service section, they had two graphs showing their increasing responsibilities in service roles, and the increasing scale of their service contributions:\nAlongside these charts, Dr. Liboiron provided contextual details that interpret this data, arguing that the increased media recognition attests to the growing national and international recognition of the significance of their work, while the increased service responsibilities attest to the growing recognition of their leadership on- and off-campus. “I described these graphs as pointing to the maturity of my work,” Dr. Liboiron told me.\nIn short: they’re showing their readers how to interpret the data provided in their dossier.\nNumbers only matter in context\nIn providing you with these tools and strategies for quantifying your case for promotion and tenure,  my intention is to show you some of the numbers you might want to include with qualitative descriptions of why your work matters. Metrics aren’t self-evident: you need to show your reader how to understand them in the context of your discipline, your institution — even your individual goals and priorities as a researcher.\nWhile the specific criteria for promotion and tenure vary from one institution to another, in general, your goal in your dossier will be to show to your reviewers your productivity and ability to bring about changes in the world — whether evident in communities, in policy, in curricula, or in scholarly conversations. By identifying alternative measures of impact, and by providing your reader with a narrative that interprets these measures, you’ll produce a more complete, accurate and nuanced picture of your pre-tenure work.\nPlan ahead to advance your writing practice\nThis spring, Letitia is offering an eight-week facilitated section of “Becoming a Better Editor of Your Own Work.” The course runs from May 4th to June 28th, 2025.

I think that colleagues in my (highly technical) subfield – EdTech – appreciate my work, but when I look at the papers that cite mine, it doesn’t seem to me that my work is resonating in neighbouring (highly qualitative) fields. I asked a colleague about it and she said she found my writing too dense. What can I do to make my writing more understandable within my discipline as a whole, beyond just my specialization?”\n– Anonymous, Educational Technology\nAnswer\nI’ve written previously about the cognitive load that a reader carries when they first peruse a text, and how reducing the length of a sentence’s subject can avoid adding to an extraneous cognitive load, which in turn increases you work’s chances of being understood, remembered, cited, or implemented. When your writing is described as “too dense,” that’s a clue that you’re making your reader carry too heavy a cognitive load as they progress through your text.\nBut shortening the length of your subject, and keeping your subject and verb close together – the recommendations in my previous piece on cognitive load – aren’t your only options for making your text easier to read. In last month’s “Ask Dr. Editor,” part one of my response to this question, I described how to use stylistic editing techniques – specifically, editing for emphasis – to reduce perceived density and increase readability.\nThis month, I want to turn my attention to a second aspect of stylistic editing: the strategic ordering of items within lists. This recommendation draws from Joseph Williams’ Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace, an excellent (if itself dense) resource for writers seeking to improve their techniques for style.\nWhen ordering items in a list, Williams advises arranging the items to progress in complexity, placing the “heaviest” or most complex item at the end. When you arrange items from lighter to heavier, you make the list easier for readers to mentally process, because they aren’t carrying the cognitive burden of that “heavy” item all the way through the sentence. Consider, for example, this short list:\nBefore: “The child experimented with grains of sand, wind, and sunshine.”\nOn their first pass of this list, a reader might momentarily attempt to apply “grains of” to each element: grains of sand, grains of wind, grains of sunshine. This misreading would be obvious, but it would nonetheless be a stumbling block, which a simple rephrase can eliminate:\nAfter: “The child experimented with wind, sunshine, and grains of sand.”\nTo determine how to revise for readability, you need to figure out which item in a list is “heaviest.” A “heavy” list item might be the longest, but it might also differ from earlier list items by being less familiar, more complex, or more abstract. Let’s look at another example:\nBefore: “Effective instructors can enhance student engagement online by hosting breakout discussions that involve collaborative problem-solving; using tools that blend synchronous interaction, multimedia content, and real-time assessment; designing experiential learning activities; and facilitating asynchronous reflection exercises that promote deep learning and metacognitive development.”\nYou can reorder this list for readability simply by placing items in order of increasing word count:\nAfter: “Effective instructors can enhance student engagement online by designing experiential learning activities; hosting breakout discussions that involve collaborative problem-solving; facilitating asynchronous reflection exercises that promote deep learning and metacognitive development; and using tools that blend synchronous interaction, multimedia content, and real-time assessment.”\nWhile that phrasing works, as it moves the reader from a four-word list item through to an 11-word list item, I prefer also considering moving from synchronous to asynchronous – which also moves us from concrete to abstract:\nAfter: “Effective instructors can enhance student engagement online by designing experiential learning activities; hosting breakout discussions that involve collaborative problem-solving; using tools that blend synchronous interaction, multimedia content, and real-time assessment; and facilitating asynchronous reflection exercises that promote deep learning and metacognitive development.”\nWhy do I describe this list as moving from concrete to abstract? Because “experiential learning activities” – if we’re familiar with that jargon phrase – can be easily pictured in the mind’s eye, as can “breakout discussions” and (if we’re familiar with the learning management system) “tools.” But what do “asynchronous reflection exercises” look like? It’s much easier for me to mentally picture a Zoom breakout room – a series of rectangles with little heads in them – than it is for me to picture an “asynchronous reflection exercise,” which might look like typing on a laptop, writing on a piece of paper, watching a video, or walking through a forest, depending on the instructor’s pedagogical choices.\nOne last example of a revised list that moves from concrete to abstract:\nBefore: “Recommended techniques include self-regulated learning frameworks and note-taking.”\nAfter: “Recommended techniques include note-taking and self-regulated learning frameworks.”\nIt’s much easier for a reader to mentally process and carry a short, concrete list item like “note-taking” through the rest of the sentence than it is for them to process and carry a long, abstract item like “self-regulated learning frameworks.” By placing the heaviest item at the end of the list, dear letter-writer, you can optimize reader comprehension and reduce the perception of density in your work.\nOf course, that’s the general rule.\nThere are always good reasons to break a rule. If this last example sentence is in a text that’s all about self-regulated learning frameworks, maybe you might determine that “note-taking” is, in this context, the heavier item. Or maybe you’re using the list to introduce two topics that you’ll discuss in depth, and you have some reason for note taking to be discussed second; in that instance, it would make sense for the items in your list to follow the order in which you elaborate on each topic.\nIf you have a good rationale for violating this rule and not placing your list items in order of increased weight, then, please, of course: break the rule.\nBut in a context in which there isn’t some particular reason why the items in your list need to be ordered in a particular way, then, I’m always going to suggest light-to-heavy. This recommended order enhances comprehension, and we need our readers to first understand our writing in order to do anything with it – whether your goal is to have them fund it, cite it, or (as has been my goal today) put it into practice.\nPlan ahead to advance your writing practice\nThis spring, Writing Short is Hard is offering an eight-week facilitated section of “Becoming a Better Editor of Your Own Work.” The course runs from May 4-June 28, 2025; the early-bird pricing is available until March 15, 2025.

I think that colleagues in my (highly technical) subfield – EdTech – appreciate my work, but when I look at the papers that cite mine, it doesn’t seem to me that my work is resonating in neighbouring (highly qualitative) fields. I asked a colleague about it and she said she found my writing too dense. What can I do to make my writing more understandable within my discipline as a whole, beyond just my specialization?\n– Anonymous, Educational Technology\nAnswer:\nWhen you’re getting the “too dense” feedback, that usually means that you aren’t using the position of the individual words within your sentences to your best advantage. I expect your writing will become more readable for colleagues within and beyond your areas of expertise if you learn to edit stylistically, for emphasis. My response to this question will be a two-parter, with this month’s column focusing on the beginnings and endings of sentences and paragraphs.\nWhen I perform a stylistic edit, I ensure that the most important content appears at the point of natural emphasis in each sentence and paragraph – that is, at its end.\nFor an example of how you can use the end of a sentence or a paragraph to emphasize a key point, please re-read the previous sentence.\nStylistic editing – editing for readability, clarityand polish, including editing for emphasis – isn’t taught in most academic programs. Instead, The Elements of Style persists as the most-taught text in universities (according to opensyllabus.org), even though professional editors have long decried that book’s outdated, overly restrictive, inconsistent, rigid and classist stance on what constitutes “good” writing. I also learned a lot from reading technical guides like Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace and Artful Sentences: Syntax as Style.\nTo reduce the apparent density of your writing, I suggest implementing these two strategies:\n1. Bury minor details in the middle of your sentence\nDon’t let the end of your sentences fall flat. Avoid ending sentences with:\nTime phrases (“in 2021”; “across the two years of the study”)\nPlace phrases (“in Vancouver”; “across Canada”)\nHedging language (“to some extent”; “in general”)\nProcedural details (“as described above”; “as follows”)\nIt’s not just that such endings can feel anticlimactic – it’s also that these weak endings make it harder for your reader to pick out and retain the most important information in your writing. Consider, for example:\nBefore: “Despite widespread skepticism about game-based learning platforms, longitudinal studies have shown significant improvements in critical thinking skills among middle-school students across Northern Europe.”\nAre the most important facts in this sentence that these skills have improved among this student population in this region? Likely not, given the sentence’s opening. Instead, it’s likely that what matters most is that, despite skepticism, studies have found improvements in important skills. So, pick up those unimportant details and pop them into an earlier point in the sentence:\nAfter: “Despite widespread skepticism about game-based learning platforms, longitudinal studies among middle-school students across Northern Europe have shown significant improvements in learners’ critical thinking skills.”\nOne grammatical feature all these weak, anticlimactic phrases have in common: they’re all prepositional phrases. If you can’t recall learning that term back in elementary school, it’s OK, because you don’t have know what it means: you can easily identify prepositional phrases using the tool at writingwellishard.com and looking for pink-highlighted phrases at the end of sentences and paragraphs. You can even turn off the non-pink highlighting to focus specifically on this part of speech. This tool enables you to quickly scan and identify sentences and paragraphs that end with prepositional phrases, so you can focus your attention where it is needed most:\nBefore:\nHere, you can see two pink-highlighted prepositions near the end of the sentence that both precede unimportant details (a location; the population of someone else’s study), giving us a clue that we might want to bring in a revision.\nAfter:\nHere, there’s still one pink-highlighted preposition near the end of the sentence, but because it precedes the most important information – the evidence that counters widespread skepticism – we know we don’t need to bring in an edit here.\nBecause I designed and host this website, I know that it doesn’t have a back end that stores your data and so won’t harvest your text for some AI-feeding corpus – honestly, I don’t want your draft text; I have no purpose for it; I’m not training any bots. But if you’re generally (and legitimately!) skeptical of claims about data security that you read online, and still aren’t comfortable cutting-and-pasting your text into a textbox, then you’re free to grab the open-source code from GitHub and install your own local version of writingwellishard.com.\nOne last note: in addition to not ending a sentence or paragraph with an unimportant detail in a prepositional phrase, I also don’t advise ending paragraphs with someone else’s words, as detailed in my November 2018 piece in this column, “Strategic paragraph structuring.”\n2. Use right-shifting in topic sentences, to increase emphasis\nNow here’s one of those times I love to break the usual “rules” of academic editing. Let’s first establish what the rule is. Many academic editors will recommend cutting phrases like “there is”, “there are” and “it is ___ that.” Indeed, I’m one of those editors – just last September, I suggested that you can cut “is” to shave your word count in character-constricted grant proposals.\nBut just because cutting “is,” “are,” “was,” and “were” is often a good idea, that doesn’t mean “is” is verboten. So let’s discuss how to “is” with intentionality.\nIf the end of a sentence or a paragraph is a place of emphasis, we can use “there is” or “there are” at the beginning of a sentence – and ideally, in a topic sentence, at the beginning of a paragraph – to shift our phrasing two words to the right on the page, and thereby subtly increase the emphasis. Here’s the example from Style: Lessons in Clarity and Grace:\nSeveral syntactic devices let you manage where in a sentence you locate units of new information.\nThere are several syntactic devices that let you manage where in a sentence you locate units of new information. (Williams [10th Ed.], p. 88)\nStarting a topic sentence with “there is” or “there are” can be particularly effective when introducing a complex or counterintuitive concept. By shifting “several syntactic devices” to the right on the page – and, grammatically, from the subject of to an object in your sentence – you’re giving your reader a bit more space and time to process the new context that your paragraph is about to present.\nThis right-shifting technique can also help create a smooth transition between paragraphs, especially when moving from a broad concept to a specific example, as the “there is/are” construction acts as a gentle bridge that eases the reader into new territory – without needing to awkwardly deploy heavy-handed transition words like “moreover,” “additionally,” “notably,” or “furthermore.” Like the most powerful rhetorical moves, though, this right-shift is most effective when used sparingly.\nRemember: The goal isn’t to have a “strong” or “climactic” ending. I know I’ve used those words, but they alone aren’t a justification for this stylistic edit. Instead, your goal here is to structure information in a way that facilitates your reader’s understanding. In educational technology research, dear letter-writer, I expect you often need to describe complex systems and methodologies. For qualitative researchers who don’t work with EdTech, your writing may feel like unfamiliar terrain. Stylistic editing and careful sentence structuring helps readers grasp both individual concepts and their broader significance.\nWhen editing, ask yourself: “What do I want my reader to remember most from this sentence? From this paragraph?” Those concepts belong at the end of each unit of text, sentence or paragraph; that’s where it will have the greatest impact on reader comprehension and retention.\nIn next month’s Ask Dr. Editor – Part 2 of my response to this letter-writer – I’ll discuss enhancing readability in long and short lists.\nPlan ahead to advance your writing practice\nThis spring, Writing Short is Hard is offering an eight-week facilitated section of “Becoming a Better Editor of Your Own Work.” The course runs from May 4-June 28; the early-bird pricing is available until March 15.

I keep hearing that interdisciplinary approaches are necessary to solve complex problems, but then Tri-Council doesn’t fund interdisciplinary research. How do I persuade a SSHRC or CIHR committee that my project is a perfect fit with their mandate?Anonymous, Sociology\nDr. Editor’s answer:\nFunding agencies’ notoriously low success rates for interdisciplinary applications are not specific to tri-agency funders: they’re a problem for funding agencies internationally (Bromham et al., 2016), and we’ve known about this issue for decades (Nelson 1980). And while CIHR’s Project and SSHRC’s Insight programs (as well as NSERC Discovery) each have a tri-agency Interdisciplinary Peer Review committee – convened in response to the Naylor Report – I’m hearing through grapevines that the success rates on those committees tend to be lower, on average, than the success rates in the discipline-specific committees.\nIntegration and implementation sciences researcher Gabriele Bammer has outlined the possible reasons for the low success of interdisciplinary grant applications, including the possibility that “that interdisciplinary research proposals are not as good as those which are discipline based” (2016) – which I doubt is true, and I suspect Dr. Bammer does too, but part of her point is that we don’t know why exactly this effect persists across international borders and funders.\nGiven your own experience of rejection, and given the anecdata I’m hearing, I wonder if you’d consider turning away from SSHRC and CIHR, and applying in 2025 to the New Frontiers in Research Fund. I’m expecting to see the deadlines for applications to their hallmark competitions, Exploration ($125K/year for two years) and Transformation ($4M/year for six years), to be announced in the second half of 2025. Looking at some of the NFRF’s previously funded projects, I suspect they’d be particularly interested in funding projects that bring in a social sciences and humanities angle, as those seem, in my entirely unscientific opinion, to be underrepresented, if the titles of projects and home departments of PIs are anything to go by.\nThe NFRF’s interdisciplinary focus isn’t the only thing that sets it apart from the tri-agency stalwarts, though. To learn more about the different norms and expectations of NFRF competitions, I spoke with 18 former NFRF peer reviewers and collected their perspectives in this 18-page PDF. They told me:\nNFRF peer reviewers have high standards for the integration of equity, diversity and inclusion in research design\n“Compared to the other tri-agency funders, in NFRF, the applicants need to have EDI in the research project and the team. If there’s a failure on EDI, the rest of the proposal will fail – even if it’s great research. In NFRF, the emphasis on EDI is a hundred times stronger than in CIHR or SSHRC.”\nWhile equity, diversion, inclusion, access, Indigenization and decolonization are being increasingly considered across tri-agency competitions, these concepts haven’t yet found their way into the evaluation criteria for their hallmark competitions; instead, the need to address EDI remains an unwritten rule, and is a component often only discussed in the training plan.\nIn contrast, the NFRF’s merit indicators for the Exploration and Transformation competitions specifically assess “equity, diversity and inclusion in research practice,” considering the research team, your practices, and your plans for implementing and evaluating your work as related to EDI.\nIf your previous grant applications haven’t addressed EDI – or if your plans have been limited to requiring trainees to take institutional training – then you’ll need to catch up on the best practices. You’ll also want to do some research into which groups of people are underrepresented your discipline. In sociology, Margolis & Romero (1998) can give you the historical context, and then Romero (2017) provides an update; following that, consider diving into Social Problems’ 2017 series Essays on Voices from the Margins: Inequalities in the Sociological House, as well as the more recent Spalter-Roth et al. (2018), Wingfield (2020), and Sablan & Mahoney (2022).\nFor those reading this piece who aren’t in the same field as our letter-writer, the key word I’ve found most helpful when looking for research on EDI in specific disciplines is “underrepresented” – unfortunately, there is a dearth of research on underrepresentation in a range of disciplines, particularly in a Canadian context.\nThey want to see plans for high-risk, high-reward projects\n“NFRF is about crazy work. It truly is. It’s about the ideas that nobody else would fund because they’re too risky, they’re too audacious.”\nIt’s hard to get risky research funded in conventional funding schemes, as Boudreau et al. (2016) have experimentally demonstrated. Not so with NFRF, which is explicitly seeking to fund proposals that “[defy] current paradigms, and bring disciplines together in unexpected ways and from bold, innovative perspectives” (see Merit Indicators).\nIf you have an idea for a project and you’re not yet certain whether it can be executed – that project might be a good candidate for the NFRF.\nFor your project to be ranked highly in an NFRF competition, you’ll need to take an approach that brings together the methods and perspectives of at least two widely divergent disciplines, either by developing new methods or by applying one discipline’s methods to a different discipline’s field. NFRF Exploration and Transformation projects need to have a pair of Co-PIs.\nThey are looking for truly interdisciplinary approaches\n“Interdisciplinarity is so important in the NFRF. You can’t do inter-subfield-of-the-same-discipline-arity.”\nHere’s where your expertise as an interdisciplinary researcher has the potential to come to the fore, dear letter-writer – but only if you truly stretch beyond the conventional.\nHere’s an exercise: jot some keywords from your program of research in the middle of a piece of paper. Then, draw six lines extending outwards in different directions from your keywords pointing to the following disciplines:\nSocial sciences\nHumanities\nNatural sciences\nEngineering\nHealth sciences\nMedicine\nStart with the discipline that seems furthest from your field. What niches, subfields, areas, or specializations in, say, engineering might also connect with your keywords and area? What areas of medical research? Don’t focus on the social science and humanities – instead, brainstorm broadly. If there was some kind of physical tool that would be of value to the people you care about, the challenges they face, what might that be? Who might know how to build it? And what if it wasn’t a tool, but a new piece of legislation, or a systematic improvement? Who could help you to develop it and ensure it reaches the right audiences?\nAfter you brainstorm potential Co-PIs across fields, connect with someone in your network who you trust, whether that’s the research development officer in your institution, a well-connected colleague, or the partner of dog owner who you frequently run into at the park. It’s time to start sending emails and arranging coffee meetings.\nSo, does the NFRF sound like it might be a better fit for your next research project than the existing tri-agency funders? If so, now’s a good time to start chatting with potential collaborators from wildly different fields from yours.\nDownload my free 18-page PDF: Peer Reviewers’ Perspectives: NFRF, and I’ll also send you – later this year, when they’re ready – my collections of Peer Reviewers’ Perspectives on the CIHR Project, SSHRC Insight and NSERC Discovery competitions.\nLetitia Henville\nAsk Dr. Editor is a monthly column by Letitia Henville, a freelance academic editor at shortishard.ca.

What are the rules for doing narrative CVs well?Anonymous, Environmental and Child Health\nDr. Editor’s answer:\nBecause it’s always nice to see an example before you write in a new genre, now’s a great time to ask your colleagues in the U.K. and Ireland if they’d be willing to share with you their “Résumé for Researchers,” which they’ve used for Royal Society and Science Foundation Ireland grants for a few years now. You could also ask a U.S.-based colleague to share with you their NIH Biosketch Supplement, but keep in mind that the NIH is implementing changes in 2025, too, which means a lot of norms are in flux. Guidance (from NIH) and templates (from the Royal Society) may also be helpful when you’re ready to begin drafting your narrative CV.\nIn the Canadian context, the best comparable we have to a narrative CV is the “most significant contributions” module that will be familiar to folks who’ve applied to the NSERC Discovery, SSHRC Insight and CIHR Project competitions. While the details of CIHR’s narrative CV aren’t yet finalized — we’ll know more in July, when they launch the fall 2025 competition — we can anticipate that it’ll probably be five pages long (six in French), require a discussion of both research contributions and contributions to training and have some kind of personal statement. Let’s consider these three sections in turn:\n1. Research contributions\nI expect you’ll be asked to list up to five contributions and that most folks will list between three and five, depending on how much detail they want to provide for each. If your methodology requires substantial time cultivating relationships with communities, government officials or staff at not-for-profit or for-profit organizations, it’s appropriate to emphasize that labour in this section of your CV.\nSome researchers think of a “contribution” as a particular publication; others think of it as a project; still others think of it as an outcome. I can see any of these approaches being appropriate though I admit a preference for focusing on outcomes. However a contribution is conceived of, I like the researchers I support to refer to completed work that has had some kind of scholarly, social, cultural, environmental or economic impact.\nI wouldn’t suggest listing successful grants here, because a grant isn’t a contribution in and of itself — a grant is just the start of a project. Having said that, if you start seeing other folks writing things like, “I have a career total of $X in external grant funding ($Y as principal investigator),” then such a line may become a norm and you might want to start adding that line in too.\nFor each contribution, write a short description, between about 120 and 220 words. Half of this description should outline the content of your contribution — your topic, your findings, the fresh angle you took, the work’s novelty or innovation or importance to people or society or the environment or ongoing scholarly conversations.\nThe second half of this description should describe the impact that your work had on others. Because impact can mean different things to different people, let’s think through what this looks like in practice.\nIf you think of your five most significant contributions as five publications, then, in that second half of your description, you might point to the fact that this particular paper was first presented at an international conference with an X per cent acceptance rate and then published in the most important journal for environmental health researchers. Maybe your paper won an award; maybe the journal in which you published it ranked it as one of the most cited of the past year; maybe it (and the companion piece you wrote for The Conversation Canada) generated media interviews; maybe you looked yourself up in Sage PolicyProfiles or WorldCat and so you can enumerate the countries and contexts in which your work is now circulating. Tell us about it.\nIf you think of your contribution as a project — a multi-year initiative; a substantial strand within your program of research — then its impact might be described as above, with the addition of the number and quality of associated articles published, conference presentations delivered and other measures similar to those of individual publications.\nIf you think of your contribution as an outcome — a change in the world; a benefit that others have reaped — then you can describe the labour that you put into bringing about that outcome and some evidence of the change you made. You can list associated publications and conference presentations as well as less conventional consequences of your work: maybe your findings were cited in best practice guidance published by a national professional organization, which shows that your work is making it into clinical practice; maybe you’ve delivered invited presentations or training for practitioners; maybe your ideas spun off into a special issue of a journal, a half-day workshop at an international conference or an industry application.\nTo be clear: some of the suggestions I’ve provided here don’t move too far away from conventional measures of scholarly impact like JIF and H-index which, as I’ve discussed previously, are inaccurate proxies of quality, and which run counter to the whole point of the narrative CV (e.g., Bordignon et al. 2023). In the short term — until reviewers are accustomed to looking at narrative CVs — I’m going to suggest that you include these kinds of numbers alongside unconventional or qualitative descriptions of impact. That’s my belief in academia’s conservativism coming to the fore. I advise conforming to existing norms in this document: while the form is shifting soon, it’ll take more time for the norms to follow.\nHaving said that, you don’t have to follow the norms if they don’t fit your work. One of my favourite examples of a research contribution is one that I saw recently, in which a person of colour — you know, the kind of researcher who’s expected to perform labour that isn’t recognized as high-value (Brissett, 2020; Guillaume & Apodaca, 2019; Matthew, 2016; Smith et al. 2020) — described the service they performed for a professional organization as indicative of their ability to build their reputation among practitioners  and so paved the way for effective knowledge translation in the future. They framed their high levels of outreach and community engagement as part of what makes them a great researcher, one with a high potential for substantial impact, and it was a compelling move. In short: if it’s appropriate for you to deviate from the above recommendations for one (or more) of your research contributions, please do so.\n2. Training and mentorship\nIn this section, I recommend first describing the context in which you provide research training — are you at a research-intensive institution, a comprehensive university, or a primarily undergraduate institution? Does your program have ready access to graduate students in research programs? How much teaching is required in your role? Do you regularly train practitioners as a part of their continuing professional development?\nOnce you’ve briefly described your context, then outline your experience providing training and mentorship. I like to see a mix of numbers, outcomes, training strategies and attention to underrepresented trainees:\nFor numbers, you can mention the number of undergraduate and graduate RAs you’ve supervised; the number of TAs supervised; the number of master’s and doctoral trainees whose dissertations or capstone projects you’ve supervised; or the number of Mitacs interns you’ve supervised, if relevant.\nFor outcomes, in addition to mentioning awards, scholarships or fellowships won by your supervisees, I also like to see career outcomes. How many of your former trainees have gone on to pursue graduate studies, obtained tenure-track positions or found relevant and meaningful work in the world outside of academia? Can you name-drop a few employers of your former trainees?\nSome mention of training strategies is nice to have, if you have the space. For example, maybe you facilitate a monthly journal-reading club or work-in-progress sessions; maybe your approach is asset-based; maybe there’s a particular skillset or method that you’re particularly strong at cultivating because you use a particular tool or software or approach.\nFinally, I expect it’ll be useful to mention your ability to cultivate an inclusive, welcoming environment for trainees who come from underrepresented groups. Do you know which populations or demographic groups are underrepresented in your discipline? Could you find some published research in this area? Once you know who is underrepresented, describe the day-to-day practices you use to support equity and foster inclusion among your team. The more peer reviewers become accustomed to reading about equity, diversity and inclusion in research design and training, the less “I have my trainees complete our institution’s EDI training” will suffice for this section.\nIf you provide substantial mentorship to students, postdoctoral fellows or early-career colleagues, it’s totally appropriate to mention that labour here as well. If you provide care-related work within your faculty role — for undergraduates in office hours, for example, or for junior colleagues — I’d love to see you bring in that often-invisible labour, if you feel that doing so will be well-received in your discipline.\nIf you hold a particular title related to your mentorship work — for instance, if your role as undergraduate chair necessitates that you mentor new adjuncts — then bring that in too.\n3. Personal statement\nThe personal statement, in my opinion, should be exceptionally brief and not too personal. If you’re early in your career, you might briefly mention particular specialized training that you received as a graduate student or postdoc; if that training is more than five years in the past or not particularly well-known, I’d leave it off.\nIn many disciplines, it’ll also be conventional that you describe your positionality here; some resources to support you in articulating your positionality include Britto (2023), Holmes (2020) and Queen’s CTL (n.d.).Queen’s CTL n.d.\nIn this section, you might briefly mention administrative or leadership roles you’ve held, or the impact on your publication record of COVID-19, caregiving responsibilities or medical or parental leaves. Personally, I align with Mollie Etheridge et al. (2024) who are skeptical of the narrative CV’s power to counter the cultural force of “care obfuscations” in academia:\nthe extent to which this approach will be successful is uncertain given that applicants have little indication – or reassurance – as to how care-giving experiences would be assessed should they disclose them. There is also little assurance that evaluators have been sufficiently trained to recognise, and then mitigate, the effect of their biases on the evaluation process [… especially in the contemporary context of a] cut-throat, metrics-based evaluation system that cast[s] care-confessions and experiences as distractions from the performative point.\nTo put it another way: it’s illegal for an interviewer to ask a prospective employee if they have or want children, and so I’m not sure it’s (yet) a good idea for researchers to self-disclose caregiving responsibilities in their grant applications. Doing so remains, unfortunately, still a high-risk move.\nFor at least the first year of CIHR Project Grant applications, then, I’ll be keeping the personal statement to a third of a page or less and I’ll be editing out details about the reason for any leaves my clients have taken.\nWriting a compelling narrative CV is an argument for your capability and for the feasibility of your proposed work. It’s a chance for researchers to begin to bring about a world in which currently invisible labour can be seen, normalized, even valued. But it’s also a tightrope on which you’ll need to dance. If you have time before the next semester starts, I suggest getting some ideas on paper for these three sections so you’re not panicking come the fall application season.\nLetitia Henville\nAsk Dr. Editor is a monthly column by Letitia Henville, a freelance academic editor at shortishard.ca.

What am I allowed to ask for? How much of my budget should be dedicated to student salaries? Is there flexibility as to how I spend the funds?\n– Anonymous, French language and literatures\nDr. Editor’s answer: I think budgets are a great way to quickly get at the heart of a grant application’s purpose. By looking at a budget, I can see the kind of research involved in a proposed project – archival (in travel expenses), land-based (in gifts for Elders and catering for feasts), qualitative (in honoraria), quantitative (in gift card prizes or data feeds), artistic or creative (in CARFAC fees), and so on. I can see what kinds of knowledge mobilization and dissemination are being prioritized; how many researchers are on the team; even whether there’s an advisory committee for a community-based or industry-engaged project.\nIn my experience editing research grant applications, I see a lot of errors in budgets. The more complex a grant, the more errors creep in – it’s pretty much inevitable. In this month’s piece, instead of focusing on the weaknesses I regularly see in grant applications – because, like it or not, errors are going to show up – let’s instead focus on strengths. So, in answering your questions, I also want to answer one of my own: what makes a budget look great?\nWhat am I allowed to ask for?\nThe most accurate answer to the question “what can I ask for?” is “anything you need to do the work successfully” – but that answer isn’t very helpful when you’re trying to write your first budget.\nThe Tri-Agency Guide on Financial Administration has lots of information about who and what is eligible, and it’s a good idea to be familiar with that document so that your reviewers don’t view your budget (and thus your application) as uninformed or lacking in credibility. But most institutions have a research office that will review your draft budget before you apply to ensure that you’re adhering to those eligibility criteria – so I don’t usually recommend spending a great deal of time reading that guide.\nInstead, I think it’s important that you learn the differences between costs that are permitted by SSHRC and costs that peer reviewers will think are appropriate. For example, when I’ve interviewed former SSHRC peer reviewers about their perceptions of budget expenses, I’ve learned that peer reviewers in the humanities are more sceptical of the article processing fees levied by journals than their colleagues in the social sciences. These article processing fees can be in excess of US$3,000, and so, for a humanities researcher like yourself, dear letter-writer, I’d suggest asking your favourite university librarian for details about any institutional agreements regarding open access before you include any OA costs in your budget; ideally, you’ll get open access covered through your institution, even though article processing fees are an eligible expense.\nFortunately, reviewers told me that they’re willing to be persuaded that all kinds of costs are appropriate for an individual project. Some reviewers might frown at high-cost hardware, high-cost APCs, and multiple international conferences, but even those reviewers seem open to being told that such expenses are necessary for a specific project, if given a sufficiently strong rationale.\nTo help you to brainstorm potential budget expenses, from student salaries to travel and knowledge mobilization costs, I created a budget spreadsheet template that you can use to experiment with a range of expenses and see how they translate into SSHRC’s budget categories.\nThe budget categories included in that template are all line items that I’d consider normal in SSHRC grant applications. It’s normal to hire one or more students; it’s normal to attend one or more conferences; it’s normal to bring your trainees to one or more of those conferences, to co-present alongside you.\nBut just because an expense is normal doesn’t mean your reviewers will necessarily believe it’s appropriate for your specific proposed project. So, in the 500 characters you have to justify each requested expense, I suggest you provide a three-part justification:\nJustify why the expense is necessary\nYou need a doctoral-level RA to work 10 hours a week to support data collection and analysis and knowledge mobilization; you need a laptop with X specifications for that RA to keep research data secure and to ensure that students from low socioeconomic backgrounds have access to this opportunity; you need to attend this specific conference in this specific year to reach the academics whose future work your results will influence.\nJustify where the numbers came from\nThe RA’s salary aligns with your institution’s agreement with your grad student union, or with the living wage in your city; the price of the laptop comes from “Big Box Store”; the location for the conference you’ll attend in Year 2 hasn’t yet been set, so you’ve used Halifax as a proxy to estimate costs.\nJustify how the expense was calculated\nShow the series of additions and multiplications that you used to come up with a particular figure. My budget template shows the numbers I usually want to see in this calculation. You might write something like, for a student’s salary, “Year 1: $30/hr x 10hrs/wk x 48 wks + 12% benefits (CPP, EI, WCB) = $16,128; Year 2: Year 1 + 3% cost-of-living increase = $16,611.84” (132 characters) or, for a conference trip, “Flight Cityname–Halifax ($600 x 2 people = $1,200) + hotel ($220/night x 3 nights x 2 = $1,320) + registration ($200/person x 2 = $400) + per diem ($60/day x 4 days x 2 = $480); taxi to/from airport ($50 each way x 2 trips = $100) = $3,500 Total” (242 characters).\nUsing this three-part strategy to justify each line item will ensure that your peer reviewers have the information they need to determine whether your estimated expenses are appropriate for the work you’d like to do.\nIn short: ask for what you need, justify why it is needed, then check with your institution to ensure each cost is eligible.\nHow much of my budget should be dedicated to student salaries?\nAgain, the most accurate answer here is an unhelpful one: whatever percentage you need. If your grant necessarily includes a lot of travel, you might only be able to put a third of your proposed budget toward one student’s salary.\nFor the overwhelming majority of IDGs that I read, though, more than half of the budget will be dedicated to the combined costs of students’ salaries and travel expenses.\nConsider, for example, the math that I provided above for a single research assistant earning $30/hr for 10 hours a week, 48 weeks per year, over two years. That single RA’s expenses come to $32,739.84. If you need two RAs, then, for student salaries alone, you’re looking at $65,479.68 of your $75,000 maximum – and that’s not even accounting for any hardware or software they might need, or any conferences they might attend.\nDo those numbers intimidate you? You’re not alone. I spoke with David Bruce, director of research grants at St. Francis Xavier University, and he told me that he finds that early-career researchers can be too cautious in requesting RA support: “Some researchers can be hesitant because they are worried that their RAs look too expensive. But trainee hiring is expensive – that’s expected. In fact, it’s an equity issue: if you underpay your RAs, then you make RAships accessible only to those who can afford to take low-wage work. So budget for a living wage and a meaningful number of hours.” I agree with David: don’t balk at paying your trainees well, or at increasing their salaries year-on-year to account for inflation.\nIf you know you want to attend one domestic conference in Year 1 and one international conference in Year 2, then enter those costs in the budget template, see what they total, and then manipulate the individual cells for your RAs to see whether you can afford to hire two RAs for 10 hours per week each, or if you need to scale that back to seven or eight.\nIs there flexibility as to how I spend the funds?\nOh yes. I’m not a post-award person – I don’t get to see into that world too often – but my understanding is that you have a large degree of flexibility with how you spend your grant funds once your proposal is successful. Again, check with your office of research services to get the official answer here, but my outsider’s understanding is that, if the expenses are eligible, you’ll probably be fine, even if you need to deviate from your plan.\nIt’s because of this flexibility that I ask the researchers I support to name the specific conferences they want to attend, rather than just indicating a lump sum for any ol’ conference in Year 2. Your reviewers need to be confident that the funding they allocate will substantially advance knowledge and, if relevant, policy, practice, or public discourse. Without a clear sense of how you’re going to get your results out into the world, your reviewers won’t feel reassured that funding in your project would be a wise use of scarce SSHRC funds.\nSo tell your reviewers what Plan A looks like. Keep it reasonable, given your track record, and given the audiences you want to reach.\nBut since you can use your grant funds to go to whichever conference you decide is going to be best, there’s no reason not to tell your reviewers what you currently think the best option is going to be. The same is true of the journals in which you want to publish, the venues for which you’ll write op-eds, even the YouTube channels, newspapers, and podcasts on which you’ll be interviewed. Your plans are allowed to change. So start with a clear plan, and budget accordingly.\nGet a copy of Letitia’s budget spreadsheet template for your next SSHRC IDG or IG application.\nLetitia Henville\nAsk Dr. Editor is a monthly column by Letitia Henville, a freelance academic editor at shortishard.ca.

People in my department consider my area unconventional; most in my faculty would describe my methodological approach as unorthodox at best. The result is that I’m much more comfortable in niche specialist conferences than I am in the big annual conference in my field, the Modern Language Association. I constantly have to convince “peers” who know nothing about my field that my work is valid, rigorous, fundable. Do you have any recommendations for a researcher like me?\n– Anonymous, English Literature (but only by department name)\nAnswer:\nIt’s challenging to work at the margins of any field, but that’s even more the case when you work in a contemporary, popular medium that lacks the markers of so-called highbrow art forms – markers like exclusivity, cultural capital, and the endorsement of long-established cultural institutions.\nAnd while it’s fine, even fun, to stay in niche, specialist conversations, you’re right that you’ll need to also write for broader audiences, notably in high-stakes genres like the book proposal, promotion and tenure dossier, and SSHRC or NFRF applications.\nOf course, there are some tried-and-true strategies that you should practice, dear letter-writer: get feedback from peers and senior colleagues who you trust; draft early and revise often; don’t write when you’re hungry (I know I can’t). But I suspect you didn’t write to me to be told the same thing that any colleague could tell you.\nIn thinking about your question, my mind turned to the best book I’ve read thus far this year: John Vaillant’s Fire Weather: A True Story from a Hotter World, which I picked up after hearing the author speak at this year’s Hay Festival in Wales. Fire Weather has nothing to do with video games. Vaillant’s topic is the 2016 Fort McMurray fire, but his subjects are also climate change, wildfires, and our human inability to comprehend things we’ve not previously encountered.\nVailiant repeatedly returns to the Lucretius problem as he explains both the slow responses of people in Fort Mac to the approaching fire, and, in parallel, humanity’s slow response to the approaching climate catastrophe. The Lucretius problem is a cognitive bias that describes our tendency to underestimate potential future events based on our limited past experiences. Described by Nassim Nicholas Taleb 10 years ago in Antifragile, Vaillant calls the Lucretius problem a “blinkered perspective,” and its pervasiveness gives him a challenging task as a writer of popular non-fiction: to enable the reader to see the severity of 21st-century wildfires, Vaillant needs to widen our perspective, but he has to achieve that goal using our existing, limited frames of understanding. It’s a paradox: if the Lucretius problem means that people repeatedly misunderstand unprecedented things, how can you use what is precedented to bring about understanding?\nVaillant uses a few different strategies, some of which you might recognize from any familiarity you have with the canon of your department: the Lucretius problem acts as a leitmotif; wildfires are repeatedly personified and then made monstrous. I imagine it might be a little hard to apply those techniques in your work (though I suspect some characters in video games may be personified too and then made monstrous). So, here are two strategies that Vaillant repeatedly deploys to familiarize the strange, which may be of value in your work as you write for peers outside your area of expertise:\nContextualize big numbers\nEvery time Vaillant provides a large number, he also provides a frame of reference to help the reader understand its size and scale. The boreal forest is “more than 6 million square miles – larger than all 50 U.S. states.” When a tree in that forest burns, its “hundred-foot pillar of flame” is “Godzilla-sized and -shaped.” Describing a 2001 wildfire in Chisholm, Alta.: “The energy released during the fire’s peak, seven-hour run was calculated to be that of seventeen one-megaton hydrogen bombs, or about four Hiroshima bombs per minute.” Every big number comes with a point of comparison to enable the reader to understand precisely how big it is.\nWhen Vaillant is dealing with unimaginably large numbers, he multiplies and extends the context he provides. Describing the number of sparks and combustions an individual person makes in a day, he hones in on cars:\n“a single four-cylinder car engine turning at an average of 2,400 rpm – driving-to-work speed – will generate around 10,000 combustions per minute – more than half a million per hour. […] Were you to run the world’s engines for just one day, the number of individual combustions would elicit an error message from your calculator. Were you to transpose this impossible number to stars, these man-made bursts of heat and light would comprise hundreds, perhaps thousands, of galaxies – every day.”\nIf you use big numbers to describe any aspect of your work, frame those numbers in a context that your readers can understand. If you were a geographer working on the 4,000-kilometre Brahmaputra River, you’d be right to say that it originates from the Angsi glacier near Mount Kailash in the northern Himalayas and empties into the Bay of Bengal – but there’s no guarantee that your readers will be able to mentally grasp that context if they aren’t familiar with the region. Since your readers are in Canada, though, you could say that the length of that 4,000-kilometre river would stretch from Victoria, B.C., to Fredericton, N.B. It’s safe to assume that readers in Canada will understand from that description that 4,000 kilometres is indeed quite far.\nIf you were a health science researcher describing an intervention that targets people with asthma in B.C. – a disease that affects around 636,000 British Columbians – you might note that that’s more asthmatics than there are citizens of Surrey, B.C., the 12th-largest city in the country.\nYou don’t need to have these stats at the top of your mind, either: I grabbed both these details by asking perplexity.ai, respectively, “What two Canadian cities are around 4,000 kilometres apart?” and, “What cities in Canada have around 630,000 people?” We all know that AI tools can be unreliable, but perplexity.ai’s advantage is that it cites its sources, allowing you to fact-check its claims.\nI don’t know if you need to cite a lot of numbers in video game research, even though I am on level 3597 of “Bird Sort,” but since you describe your methodology as unorthodox in the humanities, I thought you might get a bit quanty. If it’s not big numbers you’re sharing, though, Vaillant still has a useful model for you.\nUse sensory metaphors\nWhen you’re introducing unfamiliar concepts that can’t be quantified, dear letter-writer, then provide your reader with descriptions that appeal to their senses of sight, touch, and sound (which are often more easily described than smell or taste).\nAgain, Vaillant is exemplary here. “At room temperature, bitumen pours about as well as Nutella,” he tells us. The landscape of a bitumen mine is linked “by circuit board mazes of dirt roads and piping.” In the days before the wildfire reached Fort McMurray, its smoke could be seen “on the horizon, a windswept cauliflower of billowing grays and browns.”\nVaillant uses striking comparisons to well-known features of well-known objects – the thick viscosity of chocolate hazelnut spread; the complex, artificial patterns of pieces of electronics; the ballooning voluminousness of that pricey white brassica. By metaphorically connecting bitumen and mines and wildfire smoke to everyday material objects, it’s as if Vaillant is helping us to physically encounter these unfamiliar objects and spaces.\nHe doesn’t just make comparisons – he provides comparisons that help his readers to imagine sensing the unfamiliar.\nSimilarly, academic writing that includes multiple instances of abstract terms regularly becomes difficult to read, imagine, and follow. Often, but not always, these abstract terms are dismissed as academic jargon. Jargon isn’t necessarily a problem, as I’ve argued previously. But abstract language can be a problem, especially when abstraction is piled upon abstraction.\nLanguage that is concrete – almost tangible – is much easier to follow, because it can be pictured in the mind’s eye. And when you make your writing easier to understand, easier to mentally process, you also make your writing more persuasive, as Alter and Oppenheimer (2009) have shown.\nDoes that mean you should tell your readers that smoke is a cauliflower? Honestly, I’d rather see you craft a compelling, original sensory metaphor than see your writing descend into abstractions that your reader can’t picture or follow.\nAt its least literal, dear letter-writer, my advice this month is that, if you’re struggling to communicate the significance of your work to a skeptical audience, then consider learning from popular science and non-fiction writers, especially those working in disciplines currently treated skeptically: public health, vaccine research, or – like Vaillant – climate science. Find a popular non-fiction book in one of those fields, or listen to an author talk, and notice the strategies they use to make their work understandable. Chances are, those are strategies you can pick up, adapt, and iteratively develop in your own work.\nLetitia Henville\nAsk Dr. Editor is a monthly column by Letitia Henville, a freelance academic editor at shortishard.ca.

I know that your business is called writing short is hard — so, do you have any suggestions for researchers trying to write short?”\n– Anonymous, Asian Studies\nAnswer:\nWho is the source of that oft-cited aphorism that goes something like, “I’m sorry this letter is so long; I didn’t have enough time to make it shorter”? (Wikipedia suggests Blaise Pascal, but I never know if I can trust quote attributions I find online!)\nWriting short in grant applications can be exceptionally hard. There are a few well-known tricks, like eliminating every instance of “I believe that” and changing every “way(s) in which” to “way” or “how,” depending on context. But those changes don’t offer the same return on your investment of time as my two favourite quick tips:\nCut “is”\nThis is a writing problem that is easy to correct. (10 words)\nThis writing problem is easy to correct. (7 words)\nWhen editing your draft, search for the word “is.” In the two sentences above, searching for “is” and rephrasing the sentence enabled the writer to cut 30 per cent of the original word count without losing any of the original sentence’s meaning.\nI recommend cutting “is” as much as possible, because “is” is a symptom of loose writing. Where “is” appears, other inefficient, wordy constructions often follow. “Is” works well at the draft phase of the writing process. It’s also a great choice when you want to define something (as in, for example, “‘Is’ is a symptom of loose writing”). But it rarely belongs in the final, polished draft.\nIn short: “is” presents an opportunity for revision. And so do its friends “are,” “was,” and “were.”\nFor example, in the sentence The function of this department is the collection of accounts, we can get rid of the “is” by replacing it with “collecting”: This department collects accounts. Similarly:\nThe current focus of the medical profession is disease prevention. (10 words)\nbecomes:\nCurrently, the medical profession focuses on disease prevention. (8 words)\nOur intention is to investigate the prevalence of this trend among our selected population. (14 words)\nbecomes:\nWe will investigate the trend’s prevalence. (6 words)\nIn each of these examples, I look for another word that is already in the sentence, and I turn it into the new main verb.\nYou’ll notice in the second example above that I have not limited my revisions to just the verb “is”. Because “is” serves as a symptom of loose, baggy writing, I encourage you to look at the entire sentence that surrounds that verb to see if there are other places where you can tighten up your phrasing.\nWhile this may look like a labour-intensive process, cutting “is” as much as possible can shave a significant percentage of your word count over the course of an entire document, with minimal if any changes to the meaning of your text. Even if it only cuts your word count by three per cent, over the course of a detailed description, that three per cent is about 100 words — and that’s six lines of text gone, with no change at all to the content of your proposal.\nI designed writingwellishard.com to highlight all the “to be” verbs in your text in blue. These words are symptoms of wordiness. (Note: writingwellishard.com isn’t AI, and it doesn’t bank your text in any back-end database, because I have neither the interest nor the inclination to keep track of your writing!)\nCut “very”\nI cut almost every “very,” “highly,” “significantly” and “importantly.” I do this to try to save a line of text in a single paragraph, but I also do it because intensifiers — the adverbs and adjectives that writers include to add force to their expression — don’t have the effect that some writers imagine they might.\nTake these two examples:\nDave is a trustworthy employee.\nDave is a really trustworthy employee.\nIn which of these examples might a reader be left wondering if Dave will be pocketing staplers on the way out the door?\nWhen we’re talking about Dave’s trustworthiness, adding the intensifier “really” turns “trustworthy” from a simple binary (either Dave can be trusted or he can’t) into a spectrum: if Dave is “really” trustworthy, does that mean there are other employees who might be “very” trustworthy, or “quite” trustworthy, or “outrageously” trustworthy? How does Dave compare to these other folks?\nBeing trustworthy thus moves from an absolute quality into a characteristic that varies by degrees. The intensifier introduces a shade of grey, and with it, the possibility of doubt.\nThat’s why calling your recent coup a “prestigious award” is not an effective strategy if you want to persuade your reader of the truth of your claims.\nTwo options that are preferable to these grey-inducing intensifiers:\ncut the descriptive term; or\nreplace the description with something quantifiable.\nDon’t tell us that your trainee is “highly prolific”: tell us that they have co-authored more publications than any trainee you have supervised in your 15 years at U of X, or that they submitted N manuscripts last year, or that they spoke at # international conferences and are now writing up their results for submission. Replace the generic, grey description with some concrete evidence.\nOK, so I am suggesting adding more words, for which I apologize. But the words I’m suggesting adding are better, clearer, more concrete. If you don’t have the word count to provide that kind of evidence, then, just cut the “very.”\nBy cutting “is” and “very” and words like them, you’ll be able to both substantially shave your word count and also make your writing more clear, more precise, and thus more persuasive.\nLetitia Henville\nAsk Dr. Editor is a monthly column by Letitia Henville, a freelance academic editor at shortishard.ca.

There’s no Hansel and Gretel in my work. Is this advice even worth paying attention to?\n– Anonymous, Nursing\nAnswer:\nIn mid-2023, in the U.K., a four-part TV series called Mr Bates vs The Post Office dramatized the largest miscarriage of justice in British history: the Horizon Post Office scandal. A faulty algorithm had led to ~900 sub-postmasters being wrongly accused of fraud. The impact of these accusations was profound: many of the falsely accused filed for bankruptcy, while others committed suicide. The TV show catalyzed a public outcry, leading to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak introducing legislation to exonerate the wrongly convicted.\nThe catch? Mr Bates vs The Post Office was telling a story that had been known both to Parliament and the public since at least 2019. Journalists had published pieces about the scandal in The Guardian, The Times, even Computer Weekly; Parliament had discussed it – but it took a human-centered story to ignite the British public’s concern for the real-life post office workers behind the numbers, the court rulings, and the dollar figures. Because numbers, court rulings, and dollar figures are abstractions, while stories humanize.\nThose who advise you to tell a story in your grant applications are likely doing so to solve one of two problems: i) your grant is not exciting; or, ii) your grant is not memorable. People who advise that you tell a story are asking you to humanize your data.\nTo learn more about how storytelling can be integrated into research grant applications, I spoke with Rhonda Kronyk, an expert grant editor and one of the coaches in the course I run, “Editing Academic Research Grants in Canada.” Here’s what Rhonda advises:\nFind a human\nIn much of academic scholarship – and especially in your field, dear letter-writer – there’s a person or group of people who’ll be caught up in your research. Consider the 10,000 Canadians who have disease X and tell us about one of them. Focus on the individual nurse who follows a procedure that doesn’t effectively reduce the pain that her patient is experiencing.\nSelect a real or hypothetical person who will embody the issues that are the focus of your proposed research, and tell us about that person. Just as the Horizon Post Office scandal didn’t resonate with the British public or English parliamentarians until the story narrowed from 900 victims to the singular Mr. Bates, so too will your project benefit from painting a detailed picture of a person.\nThis person might be “someone you know, someone whose story has been featured in the media, or the subject of a hypothetical case study,” Rhonda advises. “But if you’re going the case study route, then tell that story in an engaging rather than a clinical way.” In practice, you should put that person in the subject position in your sentences, centering the actions on them, showcasing how they act and how others act toward them.\nEven if you were to work in a field that seems to implicate few or no living humans – astrophysics, say, or medieval studies – other researchers still benefit from your work. Tell the story of how your research could enhance a colleague’s research, how your innovative methods can help them achieve more nuanced or accurate results, or how your work will advance theoretical concepts in related fields. Tell us who will be impacted, how their work or lives will be different because of your work, and how you’ll connect with them.\n“Some projects can’t focus on a single character; they need to focus on a community,” says Rhonda. “You might personify this community in a composite character that emphasizes shared characteristics.” In this case, she advises, ensure that you keep the focus on what makes them human, rather than on their data.\nOnce you’ve found a human and narrowed your focus to spotlight them:\nDetail an experience\nWhether your person is someone from your research, an imaginary person, or a composite, you need to tell your reviewers who they are. Rhonda suggests “grounding them in reality without exaggerating their story for dramatic effect.”\nShe provides an example of how you can weave a story together for a grant:\nJohn is a 55-year-old white man who is one of 2,345 people living on the streets of Edmonton, Alta. John has been houseless for 15 years since he lost his job in an economic slowdown [who and the basic information that situates John within the population being researched].\nSince then, he has worked with Edmonton’s social services agencies to find a job and a permanent home [John’s dream].\nIn the ensuing 15 years, John has faced discrimination from landlords, the inability to save enough money for a rental deposit, and the daily struggle to find food, water, clothing, and other basic needs [John’s obstacles].\nJohn has worked with Lindsay, a social worker, for the past four years and, with her help has enrolled in several programs including job outreach and paid internships programs, help with a professional resume, and communications courses through the local library [what has John tried; what has or hasn’t worked].\nHe now has steady part-time employment but has been unable to move into a home. John is an ideal candidate for our pilot project, which will create 25 tiny homes in development XYZ. The first stage of this research project examined where our current efforts to put people into homes have failed and found innovative ways to get around systemic barriers to safe, quality housing [how your project helps navigate obstacles].\nThe funding from this grant will build the first 10 small homes and allow John and nine other houseless people to transition off the streets into permanent housing [how funders can help – call to action].\nHowever, a story like this isn’t enough because reviewers want data rather than claims; they want to see how your work intervenes in important discussions, rather than hear mere assertions of novelty. To do this, Rhonda says to “weave your statistics and data into your story and tie funder expectations, objectives, and requirements into the story when possible.”\nIf you take a creative writing class, you’ll learn that adding sensory details – descriptions of what can be smelled, seen, heard, tasted, or felt – is a storytelling tactic. Look for places where these details can be added. For example, when the social worker suggests another program that isn’t related to finding a home, did she sense her client tense up? What would she see if she suggested a long-term solution for John? To add details that your reviewer can almost experience as they read, experiment with adding sentences to your proposal that use a verb that evokes one of the five senses.\nIn sum: storytelling is one strategy that can excite your peer reviewers and help them recall why your research matters. Alternate strategies can be found in Connor & Mauranen 1999, Connor 2009, or Koutsantoni 2009. But for researchers who, like yourself, do work that has consequences for people – the patients and clinicians who’ll be affected by your findings – you may find that integrating storytelling techniques into your grant can make your data both memorable and compelling.\nI’ll leave the closing words to Rhonda:\n“When we are deep in the world of academia and research, it can be easy to forget how compelling well-written stories can be. It wasn’t until I shifted from academic editing to editing content by Indigenous authors that I began to fully understand that stories are more than entertainment – a well-crafted story can teach, move, and persuade audiences to take action.”\nLetitia Henville\nAsk Dr. Editor is a monthly column by Letitia Henville, a freelance academic editor at shortishard.ca.

The comparison to the “Mr Bates vs The Post Office” series is particularly striking—it highlights how abstract data can come to life when humanized through narrative. By focusing on individuals or communities affected by your research, you create an emotional connection that can make your application more compelling and memorable. The suggestion to add sensory details and bring the story to life with real or hypothetical characters is invaluable. This approach not only draws in the reader but also reinforces the significance and potential impact of your work.\nThanks for this insightful piece, Letitia—it’s a game-changer for those of us looking to refine our grant writing.\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMost popular\n01\nCareer Advice\nAdvice\nSSHRC Insight and Insight Development Grant\n02\nCareer Advice\nPolicy\nThe limits of graduate professional development\n03\nData vs MAGA\n04\nCareer Advice\nWriting\nTeaching students the connection between writing and thinking\n05\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity News and Careers\nSubscribe\nAD\nAdvertisement\nFlight 302\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity of Ottawa President and Vice Chancellor Marie-Eve Sylvestre\nFeatured Jobs\nBusiness – Lecturer or Assistant Professor, 2-year term (Strategic Management)\nMcMaster University\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Cybersecurity)\nUniversity of Regina\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Master of Data Analytics)\nUniversity of Niagara Falls Canada\nPsychology - Assistant Professor (Speech-Language Pathology)\nUniversity of Victoria\nVeterinary Medicine - Faculty Position (Large Animal Internal Medicine)\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\nView all jobs\nMore from Career Advice\nCareer Advice\nPolicy\nThe limits of graduate professional development\nThe gap between permanent academic positions and the number of PhD graduates.\nby\nDavid Lafferty\nJune 02, 2025\nCareer Advice\nAdvice\nSSHRC Insight and Insight Development Grant\nPeer reviewer’s perspectives.\nby\nLetitia Henville\nMay 27, 2025\nCareer Advice\nWriting\nTeaching students the connection between writing and thinking\nWriting is an important skill because of its role in thinking processes.

I’m struggling with this advice: “stakeholder” is a useful term for my research, and while I don’t want to offend people, I also don’t know of any other words that mean the same thing. Can I really not use “stakeholder” any longer? Even if I’m using this word to show that my research projects engage community members from the earliest stages of my process?\n– Anonymous, Law Studies\nAnswer:\nYou’re right that some people are moving away from using the term “stakeholder,” and it’s for a few different reasons. As the Indigenous Corporate Training group has detailed (2018), in many contexts, Indigenous people aren’t mere “stake”-holders – they are “rights and title holders,” and so the term “stakeholder” misrepresents their legally enshrined status. In parallel, clinical health researcher Joshua Sharfstein notes that, in medicine, the use of the term “stakeholder” gives equal status to diverse interested parties, including in contexts in which equal status is inappropriate:\nAs a business term, “stakeholder” carries an assumption that all stakes have equivalent intrinsic merit. … The purpose of good health policy … is not to make the stakeholders happy. Instead, the purpose is to advance the health of the public at reasonable cost. … [I]n a world where everyone is a “stakeholder,” there is less room for the public interest (2016).\nI also like Reed et al.’s helpful, nuanced discussion of the term’s connotations, noting both its connections to colonial land-grabs and also its “embeddedness within Western ways of knowing and being” (2024).\nBecause the issue with  “stakeholder” isn’t just that the term might “offend people,” dear letter-writer: it’s that the use of this language brings along with it a particular way of thinking about all the people who are interested in or affected by a particular outcome. It’s good that you’re engaging community members from the earliest stages of your process, but if you position all the people with whom you engage as having an equal claim to your topic of concern, you risk effacing distinctions between them while reinscribing Euro-Western ways of thinking about and relating to groups of people. “Stakeholder” problematically equates distinct groups of people, some of whose perspectives should be privileged over others.\nTo put it another way: it’s the very usefulness of the term that those who criticize it are calling into question – not its potential to offend.\nTo learn more about how researchers can rethink the language they use to better represent, engage with, and empower diverse communities, I spoke with Drs. Thokozani Kamwendo and D. Scott, co-instructors of the course Conscious and Inclusive Language in Academic Contexts, which launched this past May.\nInclusive language isn’t about banned words\nLearning to use inclusive language consciously, says Dr. Kamwendo, isn’t about memorizing lists of verboten words: “it’s about understanding how your language might cause harm and working to prevent that harm from occurring.”\n“Stakeholder” causes harm to Indigenous people when it effaces their rights, and it harms your research when people who are clued in disengage because they lose trust in you. When herpatologists use the term “lassoing” or electrical engineers use “main/subsidiary,” for the reasons I described back in 2022, they’re showing that they listen to and respect their colleagues’ perspectives. Being deliberate with your word choices is one way to put into action a belief that your colleagues’ voices belong in spaces – labs, classrooms, conference centres, fieldwork sites – from which they have been historically, and sometimes are still currently, excluded.\n“It is not enough to just say the right words,” says Dr. Scott. “Using inclusive language consciously, intentionally, enables us to be the critical thinkers that we signed up to be.”\n“When you focus on what you can’t say,” adds Dr. Kamwendo, “you’re positioning inclusive language as a narrowing, a closing in. I think the effect of inclusive language is the opposite: it widens your audience, your reach, even your perspective.”\nInclusive language is about acknowledging and making space for more diversity\nSo if you’re not memorizing lists of banned words, how might you go about being more careful and deliberate with your language choices? Dear letter-writer, you’re already on your way: you heard someone recommend that you reconsider using the word “stakeholder,” and you got curious. Continue to keep your ears and mind open.\nDrs. Kamwendo and Scott recommend a few more first steps:\nAsk people how they want to be described. In our course, we spend a good bit of time on this – on why it’s important and how to go about it for individuals and for groups. But the very short version is: ask people what language you should use to talk about them.\nAsk yourself “who is my audience,” and then take a closer look to see what assumptions you hold about this potential audience. Are you assuming that they won’t share characteristics of the people you are writing or speaking about?\nExamine your writing to ensure you are giving the people involved in your research their full props – that they have agency. A great way to do this is to look at whether you are using passive or active voice.\nFor folks curious to learn more, Drs. Kamwendo and Scott have a free one-hour webinar “Conscious and Inclusive Language in Academic Contexts” coming up on Thursday, July 25, 2024, at 12 p.m. EST – learn more here.\nLetitia Henville\nAsk Dr. Editor is a monthly column by Letitia Henville, a freelance academic editor at shortishard.ca.

S. President Donald Trump’s funding cuts and ideological crackdowns hammer American universities, many commentators see a moment of opportunity in which Canada becomes a destination for disaffected and defunded American academics.\nBut hang on just a minute before we roll out the red-and-white carpet.\nThe Americanization of Canadian higher education is already a problem; anecdotal evidence suggests that academics with PhDs from American institutions are often preferred by hiring committees over their Canadian counterparts.   Meeting the current crisis in the U.S. with calls to intensify this process risks entirely squeezing out Canadians from their own labour market. After all, unlike family doctors or nurses, we have no shortage of Canadian PhDs vying for Canadian academic jobs. As we all know, we have a shortage of academic positions, especially given the current widespread underfunding of our university system.\nIn McGill University’s Department of Anthropology – my doctoral alma mater – only one of the 16 full-time faculty members obtained his PhD in Canada. Its 15 other members all hail from doctoral programs in the United States, including from the University of Chicago, Harvard University, the University of California, Berkeley and Columbia University.\nThe situation at McGill is consistent with an analysis of Canada’s anthropology programs undertaken in 2015 by prominent Canadian anthropologists James Waldram and Janice Graham. Examining recent hiring patterns by focusing only on assistant professorships, they concluded that “two-thirds of Assistant Professors obtained their degrees from U.S. universities, and almost 80 per cent hold PhDs from a non-Canadian program.”\nNo systematic review exists to understand the current extent of the Americanization of Canadian higher education. Systematic analyses are often challenging to conduct, because it can be hard to see the provenance of professors:  Degrees are not always listed on academics’ websites, and CVs are not publicly available.\nHowever, my examination of several academic units at elite Canadian universities revealed results strikingly similar to Waldram and Graham’s conclusions. For example, the University of Toronto’s sociology department is the largest in the country, boasting more than 70 full time tenure-stream positions.  I was able to identify 57 faculty members who received their PhDs from the United States, five of whom had done their undergraduate degrees in Canada. On the other hand, there were only 10 faculty members who had obtained their PhDs in Canada, amounting to less than 15 per cent of the department.\nThe percentage I found at McGill’s sociology department was almost identical, with 16 faculty members holding PhDs from the U.S. (three of whom did their undergrads in Canada) and only three holding Canadian PhDs.\nI found similar results in many other academic units, although I only examined departments in the social sciences and humanities. Additionally, I found that hiring bias does not appear to be universal but more prominent in certain institutions and certain units, reflecting a deference to local culture. Numerous Atlantic Canadian universities, for example, appear to be entirely unaffected by it. Ontario universities appear to be more so. I also did not examine francophone Quebec universities which have their own cultural and linguistic dynamics.\nNevertheless, in examining different academic units and universities, two additionally troubling patterns emerged. First, academics holding Canadian PhDs were often the oldest members of the department, which suggests that hiring patterns have shifted and that Americanization is a more recently dominant trend.  Second, many Canadian PhDs appear to be hired because they work on topics specific to Canada that may have been integral to their job description. In other words, sociologists with Canadian PhDs focus on Canadian society, historians with Canadian PhDs on Canadian history, and political scientists with Canadian PhDs on Canadian politics, leaving world history, political theory, and international relations even more dominated by non-Canadian hires. The only areas that insulated Canadian PhDs from hiring bias were those where it would be hard to find any American candidate with an American PhD.\nMeanwhile, my non-systematic analysis found that while Canadian PhDs were far less represented in tenure-stream jobs, they were far more represented in teaching-stream positions, which generally come with less pay, less prestige and less job security.  In such a way, one could argue that Canadian PhDs are second-class citizens in their own institutions.  In an ironic gap between theory and practice, it appears that the more attuned a discipline is to questions of colonialism, imperialism, neoliberalism, inequality, and hegemony – disciplines like sociology, political science, history, or anthropology – the more likely it is to be dominated by Americans.\nWhat’s jarring about how American PhDs end up being prioritized over Canadians for academic jobs is that many Canadian academic job announcements come with a statement that “Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority.” In practice, this is easily circumvented because priority is trumped by the designation of the most qualified candidate. That is, as it should be, deferred to search committees and academic units. But as departments become more Americanized so do academic search committees, and it is not surprising that hiring bias accelerates and makes one question whether American professors in Canada with American PhDs really give any preference to Canadian PhDs for academic jobs. Certainly, the numbers I found suggest otherwise.\nRead the opposing view: American recruitment in the Canadian academy: The case in favour\nIt’s true that a minority of scholars with American PhDs are Canadian citizens and thus fit within prioritization of citizenship over academic pedigree. However, this still begs the question: Why even bother having PhD programs if we consider Canadian PhDs to be second-rate compared to American ones?   Over the years, I have had numerous conversations with ambitious undergraduates and MA students about applying to doctoral programs, and they invariably ask if they are going to be competitive on the Canadian academic labour market if they stay in Canada for their PhDs. Many do not want to leave but see no choice. They are acutely aware of existing hiring bias. It is sad that so many believe landing an academic position in Canada requires them to leave the country to the United States for a PhD, often taking Canadian scholarship money with them.\nThis is not a nativist argument. I write this as a Canadian citizen invested in this country. I also write this as an American citizen who arrived in this country for graduate school, obtained permanent residency status, and prioritized staying in Canada when I was on the job market. I’m also proud of our higher educational system and never considered my doctoral degree inferior to those of my American peers.\nA good argument exists for hiring scholars trained in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and, yes, the United States to represent a diversity of academic and global perspectives and a variety of intellectual traditions. But the current trend of Americanization of Canadian universities fosters less diversity and more intellectual homogenization. Having pockets of professors trained at the same schools invariably leads to less educational variety and misses out historically on how many major new ideas, scientific innovations, and breakthroughs have come from educational peripheries.\nWhat also gets limited are Canadian perspectives in classrooms while reproducing American culture-war debates that do not always have the same resonance in Canada. Americanization also jeopardizes the future of Canadian academic professional associations and the distinctiveness of, to cite my discipline as an example, Canadian anthropology. While many Americans assimilate to their new home, some keep a foot more firmly planted in the United States. After all, for some, Canada is a second choice after they have been unable to land work at home. Their personal, familial, and academic networks are entirely there.\nEven many of the most highly educated Americans know surprisingly little about Canada, often abstractly seeing it as a socialist paradise or merely a place to threaten to move to when Republicans are elected President.  Upon arrival, despite our not having the same deep inequalities as the United States, they confront our high housing costs and the major issues in our medical and educational systems. Lacking the resources of deep-pocketed American institutions with their huge endowments, expense funds, and subsidized housing, they also may find Canadian universities underfunded by comparison and perhaps less attractive than they had imagined in the abstract. One can cite numerous cases of American academics who come here at the start of their careers and then leave for more prestigious positions back home as quickly as they can.\nTrump’s trade war has unleashed a new nationalist sensibility in Canada and a desire to protect our identity and sovereignty. Maybe we should be applying this to our higher education system.  In the current moment, rather than encouraging more American academics, perhaps we should be better protecting made-in-Canada academic talent. Do Canadian universities have a responsibility to be Canadian?  We protect our media and cultural landscape from Americanization, so why not embrace similar protections in our higher educational system? These are not easy questions, but they need to be posed as the national character and independence of our academic system are in jeopardy.\nAri Gandsman\nAri Gandsman is an associate professor in sociological and anthropological studies at the University of Ottawa.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(9 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Apparently, the American bias that only their top ranked schools produce top scholars has crept north of 49° in some disciplines.\nReply\nTilottama Rajan\nMay 22, 2025 at 9:34 pm\nYou are absolutely right. I saw the change in the first year committees were allowed to consider non Canadians in the first round alongside Canadians. I’ve been told by a senior colleague at Toronto that Americans control hiring committees and hire their own. An ABD from a.US university is better than a Canadian PhD –my student — with an accepted book\nWe should not make this colonialism worse\nReply\nRyan Dunch\nMay 22, 2025 at 10:19 pm\nThe corollary to this is that we need to keep our PhD programs strong in Canadian research universities, in every field in which we employ faculty members. That means faculty renewal, along with investment in and prioritizing of graduate degree studies. Not just in STEM. Not just in the “big three” cities. Yet our provincial governments are not seeing this as a funding priority, and public support for the post-secondary sector is also not robust. How can we rebuild support for post-secondary education as a vital element for Canada to thrive?\nReply\nDre Gabrielle Saint-Yves\nMay 23, 2025 at 7:54 am\nJ’ai trouvé votre article très bien documenté.

However, there is more to consider than where the candidate was trained. In particular, there are many people who originate outside of the US who got their PhDs in the US. This might be an excellent source of scholars with diverse backgrounds, especially as Trump seems determined to equate every person of colour as a “DEI hire”.\nOf course, none of this matters if Canada can’t get its act together regarding housing.\nReply\nFrances Sharom\nMay 23, 2025 at 10:05 am\nThis hiring bias may only be true in the humanities and social sciences. I have been in a STEM department for all of my university career, and we have hired zero Americans during that time period.\nReply\nAndrew Brook\nMay 23, 2025 at 11:18 am\nRe. Recruitment of Americans in the Canadian Academy: The Case Against. There is every difference between luring laid-off American academics to Canada and bringing back some of the many thousand Canadian academics who work in the US because there are few academic jobs in Canada. There is also every difference between having an American PhD and being American. One-quarter of the graduate students at Harvard are, or were, international and it is a good thing, not a bad thing, for many of the the best Canadian graduates to go to a top-tier school in Europe or the US for their PhD work.\nReply\nStephanie\nMay 23, 2025 at 1:33 pm\nWe just published a study looking at hiring in Canadian psychology professors from 2012-2022. We found a significant difference in hiring American trained professors in universities with medical schools vs. comprehensive and undergrad only.  McGill was probably the worst. Zero Canadian trained hired between 2012 and 2022 from our search.\nhttps://psycnet.apa.org/record/2026-12949-001\nReply\nMike Wirth\nMay 28, 2025 at 1:26 pm\nThe problem is in part due to too few academic jobs in Canada. This is in due to the faculty demographics being bias towards older academics. The ages 50-64 make up some 43% of total academics, with another 12% above 65. Those under 40 make up a paltry 15%. This is very telling, and likely the reason why domestic students can’t be bothered with going on to do a PhD – too few jobs in academia (or anywhere else honestly). It’s a lot of time and effort put into a degree that won’t get you a job in academia. So fewer jobs mean that hiring committees tend to gravitate towards those applicants who fit the criteria well, and in reality (especially in STEM), this tends to mean (i) publication record, (ii) previous grants, (iii) PhD graduating university. American scholars tend to fit this criteria well, partially due to better access to grants (until recently). Having said that, I have also noted that sometimes there seems to be a bias in hiring practices with good Canadian candidates often given 2nd-tier “teaching-track” positions. Perhaps we value the contribution of American academe too highly in global higher education? Why do we not hire academics with degrees from more diverse regions of the world? Why do we put so much emphasis on having Phd graduate students when they have so little chance of securing a job in academia?\nReply\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMost popular\n01\nCareer Advice\nAdvice\nSSHRC Insight and Insight Development Grant\n02\nCareer Advice\nPolicy\nThe limits of graduate professional development\n03\nData vs MAGA\n04\nCareer Advice\nWriting\nTeaching students the connection between writing and thinking\n05\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity News and Careers\nSubscribe\nAD\nAdvertisement\nFlight 302\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity of Ottawa President and Vice Chancellor Marie-Eve Sylvestre\nFeatured Jobs\nPsychology - Assistant Professor (Speech-Language Pathology)\nUniversity of Victoria\nBusiness – Lecturer or Assistant Professor, 2-year term (Strategic Management)\nMcMaster University\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Cybersecurity)\nUniversity of Regina\nEducation - (2) Assistant or Associate Professors, Teaching Scholars (Educational Leadership)\nWestern University\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Master of Data Analytics)\nUniversity of Niagara Falls Canada\nView all jobs\nMore from Opinion\nOpinion\nResearch\nCancelling Congress wounds humanities research\nBudget squeeze and logistical complexities leave the century-old conference without a host.\nby\nMichael Holden\nJune 10, 2025\nOpinion\nMental Health\nNo student is an island\nImproving the collective environment benefits students’ mental health.\nby\nJustine Pineault, François Lauzier-Jobin & Martine Shareck\nJune 06, 2025\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\nPrestigious American universities have long exerted a gravitational pull on Canadian academia.\nby\nFrancois Lachapelle and X.

It has frozen or threatened to withhold federal research funding from more than 60 institutions — including Harvard, Columbia and Princeton — unless they dismantle equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) offices, eliminate programs it deems “ideological,” and submit to direct federal oversight of curricula and student organizations.\nAlthough EDI has been the primary target, attacks on other aspects of academic life and research have quickly followed. New federal actions invoking antisemitism, foreign funding “transparency” and climate research oversight have introduced fresh channels of pressure, each carrying the same message: comply, or lose funding. The effects are already visible. Princeton lost $4 million in grants related to climate change research. The University of Michigan preemptively shut down its central equity office and a reproductive-health grant panel. Columbia has yielded to pressure, while Harvard is taking the federal government to court after $8.9 billion in federal contracts were frozen.\nThe consequences extend beyond American citizens and institutions. According to an Associated Press review, more than 1,000 international students at 160 U.S. universities, including The Ohio State University, have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March. Some reportedly lost their status due to their political speech and activity.  Some reportedly lost their status due to their political speech and activity.\nRestrictions are affecting academics abroad as well. Scholars who plan to present research in the United States are being questioned at the border about their political views. In one case, a French scientist was denied entry due to criticism of Trump’s policies posted online. In today’s climate, being a foreign-born academic with an opinion that doesn’t toe the MAGA line can feel like checking every box on a Trump-era watchlist.\nUnderstandably, many scholars are anxious. Some are unsure if they’ll be allowed to return to the U.S. after a research trip abroad or a visit home. Others worry their research funding might disappear with little notice. And some face the very real prospect of deportation to countries where they could be at risk of persecution.\nCanada is already seeing the consequences. Reuters reported a 27 percent increase in U.S. graduate student applicants to the University of British Columbia. Other Canadian universities, including Toronto and Waterloo, have reported spikes in web traffic from the United States. The Financial Times recently noted that several prominent academics, including Yale professors Jason Stanley, Marci Shore and Timothy Snyder, are relocating to Canada.\nSome Canadian institutions have begun to respond. UBC has temporarily reopened graduate admissions and introduced a fast-track process for American students facing disruptions.\nFaculty members across the country are stepping up — reviewing application materials, waiving language tests and circulating emergency funding opportunities. These are meaningful efforts, but without broader coordination, they remain piecemeal.\nWhat’s needed now is a national strategy. Canada should establish a clearing house for transfer procedures and immigration guidance; offer emergency fellowships to students and postdocs whose funding has evaporated; negotiate tuition waivers and credit-transfer agreements with American universities to keep academic progress on track; provide assistance with relocation logistics; and build partnerships to connect displaced scholars with Canadian researchers, preserving research collaborations that might otherwise collapse.\nOrganizations like Universities Canada, the Canadian Association of University Teachers, and the Tri-Council funding agencies could take the lead. Academic associations, such as the Canadian Political Science Association, could offer field-specific mentorship.\nSome might ask: why should Canada act, especially given Trump’s attack on Canadian sovereignty? Two reasons stand out — one moral, and one strategic.\nFirst, there is a moral argument. Academic freedom is not the exclusive domain of any one country. When it comes under threat, it is incumbent on the broader scholarly community to respond. Canadian universities pride themselves on their international outlook. This is a moment to demonstrate that commitment — not just by welcoming researchers fleeing repression in distant countries, but by supporting those targeted by political crackdowns in the United States.\nRead the opposing view: American recruitment in the Canadian academy: The case against\nSecond, there is a pragmatic case. The United States has historically been a magnet for research talent. If leading scholars no longer feel secure working there, Canada stands to benefit — particularly as the federal government seeks to grow its innovation and research sectors. Canada could attract highly skilled academics at a time when its own universities face increasing global competition for top talent.\nBut time is short. In some cases, funding freezes arrive at university departments with 30 days’ notice. Visa cancellations come with none. For those affected, decisions must be made quickly — often with families, research agendas and entire careers on the line.\nI write this as someone who owes a great deal to Canada. I completed my master’s degree at McGill University and earned my PhD at the University of British Columbia. My graduate and postdoctoral research were supported by Canadian taxpayers through SSHRC grants. Canada is where I became a scholar, and I remain deeply grateful.\nCanadian universities have a strong global reputation. Now is the time to match that reputation with action. By stepping up, Canadian institutions can send a clear message: that academic freedom matters — and that those forced to choose between their conscience and their career will find a place, and a future, in Canada.\nDominik Stecuła\nDominik Stecuła, PhD is an assistant professor of communication at The Ohio State University.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Neuroinclusive policies and practices can promote student retention and success, says the report, but they need to be integrated and centralized.\nCreating Inclusive Campuses: Neuroinclusive Policies and Practices in Post-Secondary Education examines the experiences of neurodivergent students in Canadian postsecondary education and provides recommendations for how institutions can improve neuroinclusion on their campuses. “There’s a need to focus on individuals but we also need system change,” said Jennifer Fane, lead research associate with The Conference Board of Canada and the report author. There has been an increase in inclusive pathways into postsecondary and institutions are offering accommodations but “there are these persistent barriers that students are encountering,” she said.\nThe report draws on the first national survey of neurodiversity in Canadian postsecondary education, which invited students who identify as neurodivergent (either due to a formal diagnosis or self-identification) to participate. Neurodivergence is a non-medical term that typically encompasses conditions such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities and other neurological differences. The survey included 400 neurodivergent postsecondary students and recent graduates, as well as 78 interviews with neurodivergent students, recent graduates and staff and leaders working in accessibility services. The report is the second in a series, following a November 2024 report on the quantitative survey data.\nThe more than half of responding students who reported not disclosing their identities or diagnoses to their institution cited barriers that include challenges with diagnosis, disclosure and registration, inflexible processes and timelines, and fears of stigma and discrimination. Implementing mandatory neurodiversity training for all campus employees and integration of accessibility into institutional equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) strategic planning and policy development top the report’s recommendations. “All Canadian institutions are focused on EDI,” said Dr. Fane, but “it really has not included people with disabilities and neurodivergent individuals”. The report found that staff and leaders who reported neurodiversity was adequately being addressed in their institutions indicated that there had been a focus on accessibility within policies. The institutions had expanded the traditional EDI framework to EDI-A (equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility) or IDEA (inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility). Integrating accessibility into EDI would also provide a focus on measuring impact and growth, said Dr. Fane – a component that is currently lacking.\nIt is estimated that anywhere from 10 to 20 per cent of the population is neurodivergent, but there is no clear data on the number of neurodivergent students in Canadian higher education. This “huge gap” in data is what makes the report important, said Carly McMorris, associate professor at the University of Calgary and a member of the project’s research advisory committee. “This report is really highlighting the need across neurodivergent areas,” said Dr. McMorris. “Although I’m very focused on supporting individual needs,” she said, “I also recognize how our campuses are not neuroinclusive, meaning that it’s not just up to the neurodivergent person to be able to survive in postsecondary, but rather it’s up to neurotypical folks to provide an environment that’s neuroinclusive.”\n“This is a group that is in high need of support and it hasn’t been something that institutionally, I think, across Canada has been recognized,” said Dr. McMorris. She said that the report’s recommendations around the need for wraparound services, training for faculty and staff and establishment of low-sensory spaces could help students thrive. This report “is probably one of the most influential policy pieces that will move things forward in this field,” she said.\nWhile the report provides actionable items, Dr. Fane recognized that this is happening at a time when many postsecondary institutions are struggling financially. In their interviews, they talked to 30 accessibility services across Canadian colleges, polytechnics and universities, and all reported growth in the number of students accessing services. “They’re not really able to expand services to meet the needs that actually exist in the population without a really different view on it.”\nDr. Fane said that the University of Calgary has been a “standout” in this area with their Neurodiversity Support Office which provides an example of how services can be centralized and integrated. Another example is Kwantlen Polytechnic University’s All Citizens Pathway. Spearheaded by Fiona Whittington-Walsh, professor of sociology and lead advisor on disability, accessibility and inclusion at KPU, the program integrates students with intellectual and/or learning disabilities into undergraduate, for-credit classes. Instead of individual accommodations, courses are designed to be inclusive and accessible. “Everybody in the class has access to the same supports,” said Dr. Whittington-Walsh. “They do not need to get any kind of academic accommodations because the philosophy is that we build all of this accessible design into our teaching and into our practice.” Based on the foundation of Universal Design for Learning principles, the program uses what Dr. Whittington-Walsh calls “critical disability pedagogy”.\n“There are lots of examples of great practice and more and more I am seeing really game-changing things happen, but the progress is just really slow,” said Dr. Fane. “What the research has tried to do is make sure that individuals know more about how they can navigate the system better, the types of evidence-based strategies that might work, but then we also just need the systems to do their jobs so that the individuals are having more success with those strategies.”\nOther recommendations in the report include:\nAddress misconceptions about accommodations among faculty members through training on legal obligations, standardized processes, guidance and a formal process to address instances where a student’s right to accommodations is not being upheld.\nInclude neurodivergent students, staff and faculty in policy-making to enhance institutional neuroinclusivity.\nCentralize neurodiversity supports to ensure coordinated access to accessibility services, mental health services, support programs and other services.\nProvide neurodivergent students with targeted information relevant to their learning and cognitive profiles, as well as available services and supports, to help them develop their self‑advocacy skills.\nIncrease flexibility in institutional processes, including early access to course details and lengthened drop/withdrawal timelines, so that students can make informed decisions about course suitability.\nSet measurable outcomes to track progress and ensure accountability.\nSparrow McGowan\nSparrow McGowan is a freelance journalist, writer and editor based in Ottawa.\nTags\nNeurodiversity\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

But despite interest from certain students, no French-language university in Quebec has signed on\nIn an ideal meritocracy, a person’s skills would be enough to progress their career. The Scarborough Charter is the result of a series of nationwide inter-institutional consultations to eliminate inequalities disadvantaging people of African descent in higher education.\nParticipating universities have customized the action plan set out in the 20-page document with the goal of identifying and dismantling discriminatory barriers in their institution on an ongoing basis. By signing the charter, universities join a coalition in which participants analyze collected data and share insights to advance the inclusion of Black staff and students on campus.\nAfter learning about the charter, Sarah Vuka Makani, president of the independent Organisation des étudiant.e.s noir.e.s de l’Université de Montréal (Organization of Black students at Université de Montréal—ODENUM), said she was hurt that Université de Montréal (UdeM) had not signed it.\nUniversities have a “duty to protect” all students, she said. “It’s as though they’re sweeping [anti-Black racism] under the rug and saying we’ll deal with it later. But the real question is when exactly is ‘later’?”\nEquity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) measures on campus and in society at large have helped Ms. Vuka Makani deepen her own understanding of structural inequalities.  Microaggressions, discrimination, everyday and color-blind racism, misunderstandings, and (un)conscious biases are “a lot to process,” said Ms. Vuka Makani.  “It’s a constant feeling of insecurity,” she added. “Sometimes it’s not until later that we realize [we’ve experienced racism].” And while this can stir up painful emotions, it also strengthens her commitment to her organization.\nAs someone committed to defending Black students’ interests between student duties, she believes the refusal to adopt the Scarborough Charter penalizes her community.\n“Recognizing anti-Black racism entails making a commitment,” argued Myrlande Pierre, vice president of Quebec’s commission for human rights and youth rights. Though the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms identifies all human beings as equal, Ms. Pierre points out that some groups still experience various forms of discrimination across civil society.\nIn Quebec, Premier François Legault continues to deny the existence of systemic racism and has rejected several reports finding that Black people are racially profiled across public, professional, educational and medical spheres. This denial has notably been denounced by Amnesty International (French only).\nA French-language survey conducted this spring by the research firm Léger and the Observatoire des communautés noires du Québec (Observatory on Quebec’s Black Community) revealed that 66 per cent of Black people between the ages of 15 and 34 report having been treated unfairly by provincial and federal public services. Meanwhile, only 19 per cent of non-Black youth reported the same experience.\nIs EDI just an idea ?\nQuebec’s English-language universities, Bishop’s Concordia and McGill, signed the Scarborough Charter when it was introduced. French-language universities have yet to do so. The lack of institutional transparency troubles Ms. Vuka Makani. No matter what universities ultimately decide, she thinks they could at least notify students.\nUniversité Laval (ULaval), Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue (UQAT), and HEC Montréal agreed to speak with University Affairs about their reasoning behind not adopting the charter.\nThough these institutions share the charter’s values, their representatives acknowledged that recognizing anti-Black racism through the charter poses other challenges. The relatively low Black student population at UQAT—about 400, or 10 per cent—and the budget committed to Indigenous reconciliation has limited the institution’s positive response to the charter.\nUQAT president Vincent Rousson said the university chose not to sign the anti-racism charter because its implementation would have required significant additional resources and created overlapping policy structures. Instead, the institution opted for a more holistic and regionally grounded approach to EDI—one that includes strong commitments to Indigenous communities.\n“We had already made collective decisions with our regional partners, including First Nations,” Dr. Rousson explained. “Implementing the charter would have forced us to divert resources away from those priorities.”\n“At a certain point, choosing one thing means giving up another,” he added, noting that limited budgets require difficult decisions.\nULaval, which has about 1,500 Black students, or 25 per cent of its student population, was in the early stages of creating its EDI policy as the charter was being created. Committing to another long-term project at that stage would have been “very restrictive,” said ULaval’s EDI officer François Gélineau.\nAll three universities have developed custom internal EDI action plans to foster respectful intercultural relations and eliminate racism, injustice and discrimination. But EDI advocates say these general policies often fail to clearly acknowledge the implicit nature or severity of the discrimination levied against people with certain attributes or from certain ethnic origins, or the complexity of their intersectionality.\n“We take sexual assault very seriously and have held mini workshops on the subject,” noted Ms. Vuka Makani. “It would be nice to hold workshops about racism, too.”\nIn Montreal, HEC Director Federico Pasin said he is “ambivalent” about adopting some of the actions suggested in the charter for fear of allegations of favoritism toward Black people at the expense of other minority groups. Mr. Pasin, who was not aware of the Scarborough Charter before being contacted for an interview, said he finds the data aspect of the charter compelling.\n“People have biases. People of color are disadvantaged as a result. But are Black people really more disadvantaged than others?” he voiced during the interview.\nThe inequalities experienced by people of African descent are not unique to Quebec or Canada, Ms. Pierre pointed out. Anti-Black racism is a common historical legacy of colonialism that generates both intentional and unintentional stereotypes “still very much alive in the collective imagination.”\nEven “talking about anti-Black racism is not something everybody wants to do,” said Ms. Vuka Makani. “It’s uncomfortable. But sometimes discomfort wakes people up and triggers change.”\n*Editor’s note: When University Affairs reached out to Université de Sherbrooke, École de technologie supérieure, Université du Québec à Montréal, Université de Montréal, and Polytechnique Montréal, they directed us to their EDI practices.

Photo by: THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n1 Comments\nThe Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Mark Carney secured a fourth term in Monday’s election, bringing clarity to leaders in the postsecondary sector looking to chart a productive path forward with the new government.\nWhile higher education remained a backseat issue in an election dominated by the ongoing trade war imposed by U.S. president Donald Trump and the dual crises of housing and affordability, the Liberals have made promises with significant impact for universities\nChief among them is a $10 billion investment in building new homes, with $2 billion dedicated to student and senior housing. The new government further promises to invest in attracting leading researchers to Canadian institutions and to create a capstone organization for federal research funding to enable mission-driven research.\nGabriel Miller, president and CEO of Universities Canada (publisher of University Affairs) said his organization is eager to work with the new government to ensure it delivers on its commitments. Investments in student housing and strengthening Canada’s research ecosystem are welcome news, but he said the leading priority for the university sector is the urgent need to fix Canada’s immigration system.\n“It’s crucial that we sit down quickly with this government and restore confidence in Canada’s immigration system, because right now we’re losing people we’re going to desperately need to drive the economy,” said Mr. Miller.\nUniversities Canada, which represents 97 Canadian universities, will also be working to ensure ongoing promises by the previous Liberal government under Justin Trudeau are fulfilled. Central to those promises is a major injection of $1.8 billion in federal research grants of which 12 per cent has been disbursed since it was first announced in 2024.\nChad Gaffield, executive director of the U15, said that Canada’s leading research universities are ready to partner with the new government and that the prime minister’s election “comes at a time of real urgency to strengthen Canada as a resilient, secure and sovereign country.”\nFor many in the academic community, the new government has brought a sense of relief. Glen Jones, a professor of higher education at the University of Toronto, noted that the Conservative Party, which will remain as official opposition to a minority Liberal government, had been causing concerns with its rhetoric around “woke ideology” which could have implications for equity, diversity and inclusion policies and programs.\n“But more importantly, there were references to monitoring research activities and perhaps getting involved in interventions that would have direct implications for the autonomy of institutions and for academic freedom,” said Dr. Jones. “So I think there’s a sigh of relief about that policy platform and where it was going in terms of moving forward.”\nLinking postsecondary education to economic growth\nPostsecondary leaders communicated a sense of urgency to get to work with the new government as well as the importance of continuing conversations with policymakers from across the political spectrum.\n“We look forward to collaborating with the new government and with members from all parties to continue advancing education, research and innovation as pillars of Canada’s prosperity and leadership,” said Deep Saini, chair of Universities Canada and president and vice-chancellor of McGill University.\nThe election of the Liberal Party comes at an uncertain time for Canada and the global economy. Prime Minister Carney intends to eliminate trade barriers between the provinces and territories and build the “fastest growing economy in the G7,” among other ambitions. Postsecondary leaders say universities will be fundamental to driving that growth, and recognize they will need to move quickly to communicate to policymakers and the public how they can contribute to the Canadian economy.\n“It’s a critical time for us to show just how much we’re going to contribute to helping the country weather this storm and thrive in the long run,” said Mr. Miller.\nInternational education remains most pressing issue\nPrime Minister Carney has said he will maintain immigration levels, including caps imposed on international student visas first imposed by the Trudeau administration in January 2024. The policy change took the postsecondary sector by surprise leading to declining enrolment and severely reducing a major source of tuition revenue for universities.\n“At this point, the universities and colleges are far below the caps. In other words, there’s something about the brand of international education in Canada that has been negatively impacted by those 2024 decisions – and that’s bad for everyone,” said Dr. Jones.\nPrime Minister Carney has promised to invest $100 million over four years to attract leading researchers who have had their funding cut by the U.S. government. But Mr. Miller says more needs to be done – and soon.\n“The single area we have to make the most rapid changes in is our system for welcoming international researchers and students, which is too slow, too bureaucratic and simply not good enough to compete internationally,” he said.\nPrioritizing research and innovation\nBesides the incoming government’s promise of a $46 million investment into Canada’s AI institutions, research and innovation barely factored into the election. “We’re going through some sort of major economic transition, and research and innovation need to be in that same conversation,” said Dr. Jones.\nAccording to the OECD, Canada ranks the highest in public research and development investment but among the lowest in innovation outcomes such as technology adoption and, importantly, productivity growth – which is how countries raise citizens’ standards of living.\nPostsecondary leaders are pushing for a a more holistic conversation surrounding research and innovation.\n“It really starts by sitting down with everybody, with entrepreneurs, with Canadian businesses, with government, with universities, and asking ourselves how we make sure the benefits of our research to Canadians are maximized and amplified,” said Mr. Miller.\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

International students were also impacted, with their minimum tuition set to $20,000.\nIn his decision, Judge Dufour said the ministry failed to provide data supporting its assertion that out-of-province students were not integrating into Quebec society. The current fee structure will be maintained, however, with the ministry given a nine-month window to make amendments.\nThe French language requirement was invalidated immediately “given the near-certain impossibility of achievement,” according to the ruling.\nIncreases to international student tuition will remain unchanged. Judge Dufour deemed it reasonable for the province to want to balance funding between French and English universities as the latter attract more international students who pay higher tuition.\nHigher Education Minister Pascale Dery’s office did not respond to comment at the time of writing. The ministry has 30 days to appeal the decision.\nPhoto courtesy of: Concordia University\nMcGill, Concordia universities react to ruling\nThe regulations had followed months of negotiations between the English-speaking institutions and the province to find an agreement. By August of 2024, Concordia reported that the university’s out of province enrolment had dropped by 28 per cent.\n“Although I find little satisfaction in today’s decision – we were left no option but to challenge the government’s policies on legal grounds – I am reassured by the court’s findings,” said President and Vice-Chancellor Graham Carr in a memo to Concordia’s community members.\nThe president wrote that the university would continue to analyze the impact of the ruling on English-speaking institutions and the Quebec university network. He also reiterated Concordia’s “ongoing commitment to supporting our students’ efforts to achieve French-language proficiency.”\nA similar message was sent to the McGill community by President and Vice-Chancellor Deep Saini. McGill kept enrolment relatively stable – a drop of only 8 per cent in 2024 – by admitting more Quebec students and introducing a new scholarship to offset out-of-province tuition hikes.\n“McGill University remains firmly committed to playing an essential role in Quebec’s economy, talent pipeline, research ecosystem and to contributing to the promotion and validity of the French language,” wrote Dr. Saini.\nEtienne Paré, president of the Quebec Student Union, said he is not surprised by the decision and that the mandates had sent the wrong message about studying in Quebec.\n“The judge mostly said what we have been saying for a year-and-a-half, that the tuition hike made no sense,” he said. “The government is not sending the right message to people – if you want them to integrate more, if you want them to learn French, if you want them to become a part of Quebec society, this isn’t the way to do so.”\nMr. Paré said his union continues to oppose the tuition minimum for international students. “It’s not normal that we use international students to compensate for us because the government doesn’t invest in our universities.”\nHannah Liddle & Mohamed Berrada\nTags\nConcordia\nEnrolment\nMcGill\nPascale Déry\nPolicy\nQuebec\nQuébec\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Why do you think this is taking place?\nThere are direct political attacks south of the border on equity, diversity and inclusion, or DEI in the U.S. We are seeing the political wind shift in Canada, too. I suspect some of our institutions are looking at how to confront this wave of authoritarian populism, ethnonationalism, or whatever you want to call it, so that we are not targets.\nThis has become a political power play in some ways, and the more cynical side of me recognizes that it’s a great fundraising tool for some political parties and that people write cheques on this issue – and that helps them.\nWhat critiques of EDI do you hear from your members?\nThere has been a tendency in some circles, under the broad umbrella of EDI, to call people out more than calling people in – so there is a kernel of truth to the notions of censorship or cancel culture. But I want to emphasize that these cases are rare.\nA point I hear often is that institutions have a surface-level approach to EDI – that it was about representation instead of changing the whole culture. It also became a very bureaucratic process.\nAnother concern is that we have an increasing number of precarious contract employees who were left out of the EDI conversation. That is a serious equity issue as well.\nWhat is your perspective on the position that EDI is at odds with ‘excellence’?\nI’m told by EDI critics that excellence should be the major decision-making factor for jobs, research funding and so on. When you take that argument to the extreme, they’re saying that in a perfect world we would have a professoriate that would mirror the general population or pipeline of graduate students. We would have research that would be funded across a whole range of issues. The fact that we don’t, according to this logic, seems to suggest they are arguing that certain groups aren’t excellent. I don’t buy that argument.\nIs there merit to the argument that EDI stifles debate on campuses?\nI know some argue that conservative voices are disproportionately absent within universities and colleges, but we should look seriously at our campuses – because I see a lot of diversity. When I have meetings with members, they certainly let me know that there’s a wide range of views across the political spectrum. I don’t see any real evidence that EDI has stifled any debate. It seems to me that there is robust debate going on.\nShould those working in positions to advance EDI be worried?\nPeople are nervous. But I am also a bit more optimistic in the sense that we have stronger institutions in Canada.\nEven though it has become politicized here, it doesn’t have the same vitriolic attention as the U.S., so I hope that there’s strong resilience here in Canada to push back against the counter offensive. If we step backwards, it will be less inclusive, less diverse and less equitable.\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nTags\nEDI\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

A University of Calgary graduate student who previously attended MacEwan University, the University of Alberta and the University of Victoria, she has faced extra hurdles in accessing the right support.\nShe says when she has shared her diagnosis with professors in order to ask for accommodations, one replied, “That sounds like obsessive compulsive disorder to me. I don’t think you’re autistic,” while another gave her a “weird look.”\nMs. Coombs also has visual and auditory sensitivity and university campuses generally aren’t friendly to her neurology. At U of C’s Werklund School of Education, where she works as a research assistant, the building’s fluorescent ceiling lights make her fatigued. And she can see few options to deal with busy, noisy spaces other than wearing noise-cancelling headphones.\nShe struggles most with social communication and prefers to minimize interaction with others. However, Ms. Coombs also recognizes that many autistics desire social engagement and says universities should do more to help these students feel like they belong.\n“There needs to be a holistic approach to integrating autistic students into universities,” she insists. “We’re going to see more autistic people in university, so we need to support them.”\nThe prevalence of autism in Canada’s population has increased sharply in recent years, with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) estimating that one in every 50 of those aged one to 17 has received a diagnosis. While precise data on autism diagnosis trends in Canada is lacking, U.S. data indicates that rates in children have grown from one in 150 in 2000 to one in 36 in 2020. Rises in autism diagnoses have been attributed to improved screening methods, increased public awareness and exposure to environmental toxins, among other factors.\n“We’re going to see more autistic people in university, so we need to support them.”\nIn response, public school boards have been compelled to step up their support for autistic students. Primary and secondary schools now provide more access to specialized accommodations and one-on-one assistance. As more students with autism become able to continue their academic journey after high school, there is a growing expectation for universities to properly support them. That need for increased resources is underscored by studies demonstrating the disproportionate struggles autistic students encounter at postsecondary institutions, which can include higher rates of academic difficulties, mental health conditions, dropping out, discrimination and social exclusion by peers.\nThe Canadian Academy of Health Sciences (CAHS) noted in a 2022 report that when it comes to autism-specific assistance at postsecondary schools, “few [programs] exist in Canada.” In the North American context, this finding echoes conditions in the U.S. higher education landscape, where a 2021 study revealed that just 2.2 per cent of public and not-for-profit universities and colleges have an autism-specific college support program. In January 2023, the Canadian cross-disability charity National Educational Association of Disabled Students (NEADS) released its 2023 State of the Schools report, which found that at universities, there are frequently “ineffective accommodations due to inefficient systems and procedures” for students with disabilities, as well as an overreliance on teaching disabled students to self-advocate that creates “demeaning, frustrating and exhausting” additional labour for “something which should be a right.”\n“Many universities are trying, but they’re not getting it quite right,” says Aliyah Petzak-Grant, website manager at NEADS.\nSpanning the spectrum\nAutism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that was first identified in the early 20th century. It affects brain development, which can impair communication, socialization, learning, motor skills and other key functions. Some autistics have sensory issues, engage in repetitive behaviours and/or have limited interests. The disorder is considered a spectrum because of how widely characteristics vary in affected individuals: some can function independently while others may need lifelong care. Many refer to themselves as “neurodivergent,” a non-medical term reflecting the normality of brain differences in humans that encompasses conditions such as ADHD, dyslexia, depression and anxiety.\nAmong Canadian postsecondary institutions leading the way in meeting the diverse needs of autistic students is York University. Its Strengthening Transitions for Students with Autism Spectrum Disorders program features a broad range of services to help autistic students prepare for and succeed at university, both inside and outside the classroom. Some of the program components are geared toward helping high school students prepare for the shift to higher education, such as ASD Transition Days. This is an opportunity for local students in grades 10 and above, along with their families, to learn about all the available autism resources, services and support. There is also an annual workshop for high school special education teachers and guidance counsellors to help them prepare their students with autism for postsecondary education. Project ADVANCE, meanwhile, is a free two-week summer transition program for incoming York students with a disability that explains disability services in more detail and builds competencies in self-advocacy, communication and social engagement.\n“We’re trying to help them establish a sense of belonging and work towards self-actualization, to give them the confidence to move forward,” says Raymond Peart, coordinator of the ASD program, which also offers an early move-in day option, residence life preparation, a dedicated disability counsellor, academic coaching services and access to assistive technologies.\nAiding autistic learners’ transition to postsecondary education is also a priority for the U of Calgary, where, according to its recent survey of the student population, 17 per cent identify as being neurodiverse. In 2022, the university launched the Neurodiversity Immersive Campus Experience – two days of on-campus programming and workshops that introduce first-year neurodiverse learners to life at the university as well as some helpful campus services, while also connecting them with their neurodivergent peers. There are also two neurodiversity support advisers on staff who help develop tailored academic strategies for autistic students, while educating students, faculty and staff about neurodiversity.\n“Many universities are trying, but they’re not getting it quite right.”\nAt Université Laval, the team at the student assistance centre helps autistic students arrange common academic accommodations such as extended deadlines and quiet settings to write exams, as well as connecting them with classmates who can take class notes on their behalf. Staff can also guide students on how to access mental health counselling and help them develop their interpersonal skills. Equally important, the centre helps university employees to better understand and communicate with autistic students. For instance, the centre held a webinar last year that attracted 150 teaching staff. Staff psychologist Anne-Louise Fournier says the centre has had to expand its capacity in order to continually support growing demand for services.\n“Twenty years ago, we had no known autistic students seeking our services. Now we have more and more every year,” says Ms. Fournier, who is part of a team of 56 that includes multiple other psychologists as well as guidance counsellors, psychosocial workers and academic advisers. “We’ve increased our team of graduate tutors and provide them with training to better understand autism and best practices in communication.”\nThis investment by U Laval is good news to Ms. Coombs, who, as someone studying Canadian postsecondary support for autistic students, has observed a very uneven national landscape. A 2023 study she co-authored that surveyed staff at public universities about the barriers to supporting autistic learners identified a need for more funding, knowledgeable staff and institutional support. In an earlier 2022 study, Ms. Coombs helped map autism-specific student support at 258 publicly funded postsecondary institutions. The results revealed that only 15 offered one or more support programs.\nMs. Coombs also conducts research under the supervision of Heather Brown, an education scholar at the U of A who self-identifies as neurodivergent. Dr. Brown leads the Autism, Neurodiversity & Academic Achievement Lab, which co-runs the Campus Belonging Network, in which interdisciplinary neurodiverse and neurotypical researchers collaborate to improve belonging, access and success for autistic postsecondary students in Canada. She recently interviewed 34 current or former autistic postsecondary students about the barriers affecting their full participation in their education.\n“What emerges from our analysis … is a pervasive sense of unease among many autistic students when it comes to disclosing their autism,” says Dr. Brown, noting that fear of stigmatization comes into play. “Our data unmistakably indicates that, in multiple respects, many spaces within higher education institutions are frequently deemed unsafe by autistic students.”\n“I think the main gap is that most universities lack mentorship specifically for these students,” says Ms. Petzak-Grant at NEADS, who self-identifies as autistic. She notes that being matched with a peer mentor was tremendously valuable to helping her navigate life as a university student.\nMentorship is a key focus at Simon Fraser University, which since 2013 has been offering the Autism Mentorship Initiative (AMI). Participants are paired with a trained student mentor for a full academic year of weekly meetings. AMI co-creator Grace Iarocci, a psychology professor who directs SFU’s Autism and Developmental Disabilities Lab, says those who use the free service benefit from knowledgeable, caring guidance from mentors focused on “navigating the university, adjusting to changes, asking for help, getting connected with activities and organizations, and social adaptation.” Dr. Iarocci is tracking the initiative’s effectiveness, and in a 2021 co-authored paper, she observed improvement with “notable changes in mentees’ academic, social and emotional adjustment.”\nSupporting the transition to the workforce\nAs critical as it is for universities to welcome, support and integrate autistic learners, it’s also vital to adequately prepare them for life after graduation. In its 2022 report, the CAHS noted, “Autistic students can benefit from enhanced access to internships, cooperative education and campus employment services.” The need for such support programs is underscored by the much higher rates of unemployment or underemployment faced by Canadians with autism: the PHAC reported in 2017 that just 33 per cent of Canadian adults with autism had jobs.\nA recent report by Deloitte Canada that surveyed 454 autistic adults across the country found a disproportionate number worked on a part-time, contract or temporary basis — 41.7 per cent, compared to 18.4 per cent of non-autistic Canadians. They also face higher rates of job turnover and shorter average job tenure. The report identified the main barriers to their participation in the workforce include the interview process because of its focus on social versus job-related competencies, indicated by 40 per cent of respondents; the perception of stigma attached to autism, indicated by 55 per cent; and being the target of discriminatory treatment, reported by 42 per cent.\nDue to an increased awareness of these circumstances, universities are adopting a variety of approaches to help autistic learners develop expertise in self-advocacy in an employment context. For instance, U Laval created a six-module online workshop to help students with disabilities successfully integrate into the job market. The modules explore topics such as understanding personal abilities and needs, accessing support at work and exploring community resources. A similar workshop is offered by the University of Toronto, focused on disclosure and accommodation strategies in the workplace for all students who identify as living with a disability. To help students with autism and other disabilities develop practical employment skills that will serve them well in the labour market, York offers a paid work study program at its Technology Lab.\nInstitutions are also reaching out to partners in the non-profit sector, Athabasca University has launched a new collaboration with Inclusion Alberta to create inclusive learning and employment opportunities for its learners with developmental disabilities. The non-profit will support the institution in connecting these students with suitable employment opportunities in their communities, and guide prospective employers on how to best accommodate and support the success of such employees.\n“Inclusion Alberta will explain to employers what it means to truly include a person with developmental disabilities, and what a beautiful arrangement it can be for both the employer and the employee,” says Serita Smith, director of learner support services at Athabasca.\nLast year, the U of C embarked on a comprehensive approach to supporting the employment prospects of autistic students by introducing the Work-Integrated Learning for Neurodiverse Students initiative. Supported by a $3.75 million gift from the Sinneave Family Foundation, the four-year project focuses on education, employment and housing outcomes for autistic youths and adults. By adopting a systemic approach to transforming the employment preparation ecosystem, U of C enables students to cooperate with employers to proactively identify and mitigate barriers to full inclusion in the workplace so that neurodiverse employees don’t have to ask for accommodations in the first place.\n“Workplace cultures thrive through diversity. Diverse teams make better decisions. They are more welcoming, thoughtful, compassionate places to work,” says Leslie Reid, vice-provost of teaching and learning at the U of C. Increased efforts to help achieve that goal are rooted in the growing recognition that universities have a responsibility to help ensure “people who are neurodivergent are part of the workplace in every way, shape and form.”\nSharon Aschaiek is a Toronto-based writer and communication consultant specializing in the higher education sector.\nSharon Aschaiek with files from Mohamed Berrada\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

I can confirm that I would have found this type of support invaluable, both as a student and later.  Other helpful matters include the following: 1) knowing that I was neurodivergent, 2) receiving financial assistance that could alleviate my unremitting student poverty, 3) knowing beforehand that autistic female students are sexually vulnerable, and 4) knowing beforehand that competent autistic adults, particularly females, are taken advantage of in a multitude of ways, including the academic system. I hope the universities get it right and that one day aspiring NDs can enjoy the same level of life satisfaction as NTs.\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMore from Features\nFeatures\nInternational students\nInside the life of an international student\nEvery day brings new adventures, challenges and opportunities for a student coming from abroad.\nby\nSelena Phillips-Boyle\nMay 26, 2025\nFeatures\nArts\nNew coalition forms to advocate for art and design universities\nIt’s time to shine light on the impact of art and design schools, say presidents.\nby\nHannah Liddle\nMay 14, 2025\nFeatures\nEnrolment\nSolving the male enrolment puzzle\nIn Canada and around the world, young men are opting out of postsecondary education.

When his brother was 12 years old, he joined a powerchair hockey league in which Mr. Petruska eventually participated as a coach. and is still involved with to this day as a coach and board member. Mr. Petruska was disappointed when he came to Lethbridge for university and realized that there were no powerchair sports leagues in the city. This inspired him to start one himself.\n“it was pretty disheartening to me to see that not being an option for individuals who have physical disabilities, so I looked to get funding…I felt I could make a difference there,” he said.\nWhen he launched the league, Mr. Petruska said the response from players was very positive.\n“It’s been really heartwarming for me … I can tell how much they enjoy it because when we do have time off they’re itching to get back. And for the players, it’s huge. I’ve had a lot of players come up to me and tell me how much powerchair sports and how much powerchair soccer means to them, because for them, it’s two hours where they’re no longer just an individual with a physical disability. They’re an individual that’s an athlete,” he said.\nPhoto courtesy of Chase Petruska.\nMr. Petruska said there were challenges in launching the league as finding a gym and reserving gym time was difficult. However, the U of Lethbridge helped out not only with funding the project but with offering access to a gym with a 50 per cent discount, storing the powerchairs and helping with recruitment of players. Mr. Petruska said they used traditional advertising such as TV ads and posters to recruit players while also reaching out to local school districts to ask if they had anybody who they would recommend the league to. Players in the league range from five years old to adults with the oldest player being in their late 40s.\nThe league is helping Mr. Petruska in his research for his master’s thesis on the mental health and stress faced by people with physical disabilities. Mr. Petruska has also recruited players in the league to participate in his research on how power chair sports impacts the mental health of people with physical disabilities. Players who have agreed to participate in the study have been answering questionnaires and providing urine and saliva samples. He is currently in the process of doing analysis but is already seeing that there is a biological change that can be seen from tracking of metabolomics in participants as a result of the league.\nOne of the first members of the U of Lethbridge league was Angelina Froese. Ms. Froese said she appreciates how the league welcomes everyone no matter how much experience they have in powerchair sports but now that she has been a part of the league for a while she hopes for more people to participate in the future so that she can play with more experienced players.\nMs. Froese said that for her and many of the other players with physical disabilities, playing sports was never something they thought they would get the opportunity to do in their life, but that this league gave them a chance to do so. Ms. Froese also credits the coaches for how they trained new players.\n“They take it slow and even though we make mistakes they just keep going and don’t stop until we get it right.

With rising food and housing costs, stakeholders are calling for reform and better dissemination of information.\nBy\nMohamed Berrada\nDecember 13, 2023\nPosted in\nArticles\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nRead this article in French\n0 Comments\nLast month, the Quebec Student Union published a report on university student funding and debt in Quebec, prepared by the Groupe de recherche en économie publique appliquée.It showed that 41.1 per cent of university student loans were obtained through private financial institutions rather than the student financial assistance program. Government-funded student loans, bursary programs and bank loans account for about 88.5 per cent of all student loans, a proportion which varies by program eligibility. Among eligible students, 53.5 per cent of debt is held by government programs, while among ineligible students, 73.7 per cent is held by banks. The report also revealed that students’ top expenses are housing (28.9 per cent), tuition (16.7 per cent), food (15.9 per cent) and transportation (7.2 per cent).\n“When parents can’t meet their children’s financial needs, student loans provide crucial support in paying for tuition, books and other expenses,” said Jacinthe Cloutier, a faculty member of the consumer sciences department at Université Laval. Other factors influencing parental purchasing power also have an impact on students. “In recent years in particular, inflation has made it hard for parents to save – for their children or for themselves,” she said.\nDebt puts students under constant pressure. “The main result is stress. For some, it’s overwhelming. It keeps them from focusing on coursework, and they end up dropping out. Others hold down two jobs to cover their loans. This could be avoided if they weren’t under such a large financial burden,” Dr. Cloutier said.\nOn Oct. 20, the Observatoire sur la réussite en enseignement supérieur (ORES) released a report, Accessibilité financière aux études : Quelles conditions pour la réussite étudiante, which analyzed current barriers to financial aid in Quebec higher education and suggested ways to promote student success in a time of inflation and a rising cost of living.\nORES director Julie Gagné highlighted student mental health as “a major concern – especially since the pandemic – that is often connected to other issues.”\nFood and housing\nAlong with a needs-focused structured financial aid system and relevant paid student work, the report identified two other key socioeconomic factors to support student success: access to a healthy diet and affordable housing.\nStudents who experience food insecurity are three times more likely to suffer from depression and anxiety or to pause coursework. This can lead to lower grades, increases failure rates and can inevitably delay graduation. As a result, half of those students end up not graduating at all. Similarly, 64 per cent of students who rent a place to live spend around 30 per cent of their monthly income on housing. For nearly half, this has an impact on their studies. The housing crisis is worsening this situation, particularly for students renting private apartments outside their budgets. Getting stakeholders to collaborate and identify best practices is crucial, according to Audrey Bouchard-Lachance, who is responsible for knowledge mobilization at ORES. She says that solutions vary by institution and local context. “To meet these needs, institutions must partner with community organizations and build food security and access to housing into their strategic plans.”\nORES believes that university boards and administrations can play an important role by promoting partnerships to build affordable housing, pushing for tax exemptions and developing institutional policies to reduce student food insecurity. It also emphasizes that international student recruiting and campus life services must work together to better align housing strategies. ORES also recommends that Quebec’s department of higher education increase the financial aid allocated to housing and food and focus on ensuring students have a livable income that guarantees equitable access to housing and a healthy diet.\nThe importance of financial aid advice\nUniversity financial aid advisers are a valuable resource. They provide personalized guidance for each student’s specific situation. The Association québécoise des responsables d’aide financière aux étudiant.e.s represents financial aid staff at all Quebec universities and many CEGEPs. According to its president, Yan Martel, the association’s primary objective is “to foster communication between members.” Noting that its members help students achieve financial wellness, he emphasized the importance of “financial literacy, sharing best practices and encouraging the sound management of personal finances.”\nMr. Martel, who is himself a financial aid adviser at Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, explained that students lack awareness about the available programs and how to apply for them. He believes that it is essential to make this information accessible and understandable to students.\nMr. Martel advocates for explaining the benefits of a university education to students from day one. He recommends empowering each faculty and department to host talks by former students and undertake other initiatives to promote the career prospects their programs offer. “The goal is to help them understand that university education isn’t just a driver of debt. It’s an investment in the future.” He added that programs that have adopted this forward-looking approach have already observed a significant difference in how students see the future.\nThe role of CCAFE\nIn Quebec, the Comité consultatif sur l’accessibilité financière aux études (CCAFE) advisory committee provides the minister of higher education with advice on the financial accessibility of education. Its 16 members conduct studies, consult stakeholders, examine financial regulations and guidelines and produce plain language information on subjects like financial aid.\n“The committee makes recommendations – some perennial – on how to improve financial aid programs,” said CCAFE coordinator Maryse Tétreault. She too lamented students’ lack of awareness about the resources available to them. “Committee members have underscored that many students are unaware of the government’s financial aid programs or think that the application process is too complicated. This could be one reason for the decrease in applications for financial aid in recent years.”\nThe president of CCAFE, Éric Tessier, agrees. “Two years ago, the government ran a campaign to inform students that they could be eligible for financial aid. In spite of that, there was a slight drop in financial aid applications, but that appears to have stabilized.” He added, “We are also considering developing case studies to help students understand their eligibility for financial aid.”\nAccording to Ms. Tétreault, the minister also has a role to play in sharing and improving access to information about these programs. “We find that many eligible students don’t apply or never complete the application process. Although that could be due to several reasons, it suggests that simplifying the application form and procedure would allow more students to get the financial aid they’re entitled to.”\nWhile access to financial aid for out-of-province students is already quite limited, the situation could worsen if the Quebec government moves ahead with the tuition fee increase it announced for those students in October. This decision “could affect the financial capacity of institutions to offer financial aid, since some of the fees they have collected since the 2018 deregulation of tuition for foreign students has been earmarked for that type of support,” Mr. Tessier said. “These increases could drive away students, and they fail to resolve the issue of university underfunding,” he said, noting that CCAFE was not consulted on the question. “We nonetheless plan on meeting with university leaders to assess the impact. We’ll look at the revenue generated by these increases and how it can be used to help already enrolled Quebec students.”\nMohamed Berrada\nMohamed Berrada is the Associate editor, francophone for Affaires Universitaires.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

The lack of formal recognition has left many feeling unprotected and unwelcome in the academic workplace.\nBy\nJohn Loeppky\nApril 26, 2023\nPosted in\nFeature articles\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nRead this article in French\n9 Comments\nVéro Leduc didn’t intend to become the first Deaf full-time professor at a Quebec university. “I didn’t really want to become a university teacher. It was not necessarily my dream career,” she says. “I feel, you know, like someone who [got] pregnant and didn’t think about it beforehand.”\nWhether she wanted to or not, Dr. Leduc has been blazing a trail as she builds her career – and it’s come with no shortage of barriers. Even now, as the head of a lab called Disability, Deafhood and Innovation at Université du Québec à Montréal, she says she has had to fight to be provided with her own LSQ (Langue des signes québécoise) interpreter. And though her employer did eventually meet some of her requests, it was up to her to find funding from the province for other workplace accommodations that seemingly fell outside the normal scope of resources available to employees, like notetaking and assistance with vetting uncaptioned videos for class use. “It was a very chaotic process,” she says.\nThe persistence that Dr. Leduc has had to demonstrate and the institutional reluctance that she’s encountered in getting her needs recognized and attended to – not to mention the professional needs of those who support Dr. Leduc in her work, like the interpreter – have, throughout her career, discouraged the scholar. “It’s still an issue today,” she says. “There’s still a lot of work to do.”\nFaculty who are Deaf, disabled and Mad (a term some with mental illness have reclaimed) have a different path to accommodations than students. At most Canadian universities, student accommodations are handled by a central accessibility office. The system that students follow has been criticized as being convoluted, dehumanizing and often poorly managed, but at least a formal, consistent system exists. At the University of Regina, for example, students can complete a form with their healthcare providers that lists specific accommodations to be put into place and includes diagnostic criteria for the health professional to fill out. Universities across the country offer similar versions of this approach. For many disabled students, if you don’t have a diagnosis, you don’t get the supports you need.\nWhen it comes to accommodations for faculty members and staff, however, the process is even more difficult. Many say that they face an opaque system of informal agreements, battles with human resources departments and frustrating conversations with various levels of university bureaucracy. Jay Dolmage, professor at the University of Waterloo and the founding editor of the Canadian Journal of Disability Studies (CJDS), says that this distinct lack of reliable and actionable accessibility policies for employees nationwide has dire consequences.\n“The policies that do exist largely do not centrally fund accommodations. This means that accommodations come out of individual department and unit budgets, and [they] compel faculty to disclose to their chairs and deans,” he says. “The result is a culture of silence and passing [as nondisabled]. The result is the attrition of disabled teachers and researchers.”\nThe number of disabled faculty in Canada is difficult to quantify. Anecdotally, the vast majority don’t choose to disclose. One reason may be that there is little to nothing to be gained from doing so. Recent research published in CJDS by the University of Ottawa’s Natasha Saltes found that in the 2017-18 academic year, only 42 of 96 Canadian universities surveyed had a staff accessibility and accommodations policy on their website or available directly through human resources.\nOne disabled academic at a postsecondary institution in western Canada, who asked to speak without attribution, says their university insists on addressing accommodations on a case-by-case basis, which has left them without the support they need. The scholar points out that by treating workplace accommodations as a personal issue rather than a systemic one, universities have undercut disabled employees’ ability to organize for better working conditions.\n“[With] the process to get accommodations, there’s a lot of privacy and confidentiality involved,” the faculty member says. “I think people are ashamed of it [and] the university is, in a way, trying to make me feel ashamed, or like I don’t deserve accommodations.” The personal and professional toll of seeking accommodations is why some disabled faculty choose not to disclose a disability to their university – and it’s why they often suggest that their disabled colleagues do the same.\nSarah Madoka Currie, a PhD candidate at U of Waterloo who also serves in a teaching role, says the same approach applies to mental-health disabilities and accommodations. “Particularly in the case of mental disability or madness, a lot of them [faculty members] choose to just not disclose at all and do off-the-books deals with their department, with as little of it in writing as possible,” she says. “The obvious problem is if that plan starts to fail or go awry, nothing is in writing and you can’t challenge it .… You’re basically operating on good faith.”\nIt’s a tendency that has left Ms. Currie wondering if she wants to continue down the academic path and seek out a more permanent faculty gig. She worries that by working in this environment, she’s letting the university off the hook from engaging in widespread institutional change. Some also choose not to seek accommodations because of harmful stereotypes associated with disability. Danielle Lorenz, who is pursuing a PhD at the University of Alberta and is an associate editor at CJSD, says that few people she knows in higher education disclose their disabilities because of the perception that it will prevent them from putting in the work necessary to land a rare tenured position.\n“Just because the whole tenure and promotion process is based on output and quantitative measure, if you’re not producing because you’re sick, well, according to the academy, you’re obviously not a good fit,” she says. These judgements are made, she adds, even though the circumstances impacting that person’s productivity are often outside of their control.\nDr. Dolmage, who does not identify as disabled, says he’s heard countless similar stories from disabled colleagues. Taken together, these experiences demonstrate just how deeply ableism (discrimination or systemic bias based on one’s disability) runs in university operations and structures.\n“The message is, clearly, that universities do not expect to have disabled faculty or staff, and the culture of ableism helps to ensure that most disabled faculty will feel it is dangerous to disclose a disability.” And yet, he says that change is possible.\nUniversities in Canada have a duty to accommodate disabled employees according to provincial human rights law and other provincial policies. In Ontario, universities must meet certain employment and workplace accessibility standards as set out by the Ontario Human Rights Code and the Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act (AODA). Both pieces of legislation advise employers to take a case-by-case approach to workplace accommodations.\nUnder the AODA specifically, public sector employers and organizations with 50 or more employees are also expected to create and document a process for individualized accommodation plans. At U of Waterloo, the human resources department offers a set of guidelines for employees on how to proceed with an accommodation request directly through the institution’s occupational health team.\n“The university prioritizes assisting employees with disabilities in au manner which respects the dignity of each employee and works to find a solution that meets the unique needs of each individual, promotes integration and full participation in campus life, and ensures confidentiality,” says Rebecca Elming, senior manager of media relations at U of Waterloo.\nWork is underway at the university to take those guidelines a step further by replacing them with an official policy outlining employee accommodations. A policy stands to make the pathway to accommodations enforceable in a way that the guidelines are not, and the policy-development process at the university would open those guidelines to employee feedback as they are revised and approved. The faculty association (which the policy-development committee has already consulted, along with the University of Waterloo Staff Association, the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 793, the provost and specific university employees) says one of its main priorities for this policy is the creation of a central office separate from the human resources department to manage and facilitate accommodations. It’s also aiming for a centralized or cost-recovery approach to funding accommodations as a way of preventing reasonable requests from possibly being rejected due to limited funds in a unit (accommodations are currently funded through the employee’s home faculty or department).\nDr. Dolmage is among the staff members who have been consulted during the drafting of the new policy. He emphasizes that the document could go a long way in making positive change for disabled employees at U of Waterloo and adds that it could set an important standard for universities across the country.\nFor her part, Dr. Leduc is a little more skeptical about new policies and practices. She says she feels that as of late, they are at the whim of whatever new equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) initiative is put in place and disabled faculty members like her are along for the ride. She adds that most of the postsecondary sector’s efforts at EDI are “like a façade” created to suit the requirements of federal funding agencies like the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), instead of sincerely aspiring to tangible equity and inclusion that people with disabilities are still seeking.\nDr. Leduc holds the Canada Research Chair (CRC) in cultural citizenship of Deaf people and cultural equity practices, and in this role she and the researchers in her lab are examining the social and cultural participation of Deaf people. The researcher points to the CRC program itself, which is administered by SSHRC, as an example of one such EDI initiative that in practice, she says, hasn’t done much to help disabled scholars. Universities must show proof of a formal EDI plan in order to be eligible for CRC funding. Yet even with these EDI plans in place “it’s still very hard for Deaf and disabled people to have real access to the university,” Dr. Leduc says.\nDespite her criticism of universities, Dr. Leduc says it’s important for her to simultaneously hold the dueling beliefs that academic institutions are largely inaccessible and that things are starting to shift for the better. Earlier this year, UQAM struck a committee on equity and inclusion for disabled people under the banner of a two-year inclusion strategy. The committee will soon begin community consultations on how to improve accessibility, specifically in the recruitment and retention of disabled staff and faculty members, with the end goal of providing administration with actionable recommendations.\n“Critique can be perceived sometimes as pessimistic, but I’m not a pessimist,” Dr. Leduc says. “I can be both discouraged by the slowness of change in the university and, at the same time, I can also be optimistic .… I think it’s important to honour the complexity.”\nPart of the benefit of bringing more disabled faculty into public academic life, according to those interviewed for this story, is that their lived experience can inform their teaching in a way that welcomes more disabled students into universities. For Ms. Currie, her identity as Mad is key to what she brings to pedagogical discussions.\n“I do feel like a lot of my value to my university is … actually how I think so much differently than everyone else at the table,” she says. “Had you not included me, or had the system worked and eliminated me, I think some of those ideas would be lost.”\nFor the faculty member working in western Canada, lived experience with disability has led to a more inclusive classroom environment. “My own experience has made me a much better teacher,” they say. “My class is more [focused on] slow pedagogy now: less work, less speed, more time to think and reflect, and work. My own slowness slowed it down for everybody and I think that’s better for all of us.”\nMs. Lorenz agrees. By taking up space in these environments, disabled instructors are disrupting outdated professional expectations. “I think a lot of the academy still replicates or wants to replicate the old guard. And in that way disability … is foreign or scary,” she says. Creating a truly inclusive workplace means “making space for difference, whatever difference looks like or sounds like, and not seeing it as a deficiency.”\nWhen asked how faculty and students can show solidarity with their disabled colleagues, Dr. Dolmage says that administrative structures need to move away from seeing disability as something to be fixed, and towards an understanding of disability as a key pillar in any institution’s knowledge base.\n“There are no ‘big problems’ that we face as a society for which disabled people’s knowledge and understanding are not essential,” he says. “This also cues us to find ways to create spaces on our campuses for disability as a positive identity, a resource. This is the opposite of the medicalized, legalized understandings of disability we see in most of the curriculum, and certainly in the system of simply ‘accommodating’ disability.”\nFor Dr. Leduc, her message to disabled faculty seeking support is simple: fight like hell.\n“You clearly have to make your space,” she says. “Equity is not something that will come on a silver plate.”\nJohn Loeppky\nJohn Loeppky is a disabled freelance writer, actor and creative currently living in Treaty 6 Territory in Saskatoon.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(9 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

It shines a light on a huge gap throughout the PSI sector.  Ableism is a huge barrier and the EDI work being done largely excludes people with disabilities or it is just an after thought.\nThere is a lot of work to do and for staff, there is an even great power divide than our faculty partners and for non-unionized staff if you seek accommodations for your disability, you are edged out, diminished or fired.\nWe need to do better.  We conduct research and help other sectors create standards and we ourselves in this sector, do not apply these best practices internally.\nGregor Wolbring\nApril 26, 2023 at 3:04 pm\nmay be of interest. some of our EDI work.

I found it very refreshing and supports my own experiences with working on campus as an academic librarian with a hidden disability. I’m wondering if there is any interest in creating a community around this?  I agree with Dr. Leduc that there is a need to “fight like hell.” BUT to do that as an individual is an all consuming and, in my experience, a very isolating task.\nJudy MacDonald\nApril 27, 2023 at 10:49 am\nIn my opinion, creating a community where support and shared experiences have a platform is essential to dismantling ableism within the academy.  At Dalhousie University we started a Staff and Faculty Disability Caucus – with a business meeting once a month where we address pressing policy and structural issues at the University related to disability, and for the other three weeks of the month we have a ‘drop-in’ session once a week where members can get support from one another, connect with others who ‘get it’, or share ideas for making the workplace more inclusive and accessible. We have been running for almost three years, and we are recognized by the university as a valuable resource in moving the University’s accessible plan forward (Nova Scotia has a provincial accessibility act (2017) which demands detailed plans of action by post secondary institutions. Dalhousie had a Queer Caucus, a Black Faculty and Staff Caucus, and an Indigenous Council, but prior to 2020, nothing to represent disability. I would encourage other universities to develop a Disability Caucus, and if we can do anything to assist others please reach out.\nAmédé Gogovor\nApril 26, 2023 at 6:08 pm\nI applaud Dr. Leduc and all the other scholars mentioned in this article for sharing their experiences, especially with regard to invisible disabilities. The awareness, in which I am involved, is just beginning. Thank you for continuing.\nProf. Leslie G. Roman\nMay 2, 2023 at 3:07 pm\nWhat an insightful and long overdue essay! It would be great to see this essay expanded into a series by disabled faculty, staff and students in Canada who can shed much urgent light on the ableist practice and ways of resisting and transforming them. It is the case that the oppression of ableism is gendered, classed, racialized and colonialized. We need intersectional perspectives on ableism and we have much expertise to offer! Committed scholars and activists at UBC have called for a:1) Task Force to identify barriers and offer more than a consumerist services model including a serious Disability Studies Program/Centre at level of education, undergraduate and graduate programs; 2) a CRC Chair in Disability Studies that has whose scholarly research program has outreach commitments to the larger community; 3) funded scholarships and professorships in the area need to be built and sustained which support programmatic and curricular transformation. The VPRI Excellence Program of Wingspan: Disability Arts, Culture, and Public Pedagogy has been one such example (see https://wingspan.educ.ubc.ca/ ) and both the former Presidents’ Working Committee on Disability Culture, Art and Equity and the new Disability Affinity Group have called on senior administrators to make serious change that establishes a Task Force and supports critically-minded transformations that enable UBC to learn from and listen to its own disabled faculty, staff and students to move the serious anti-ablism into spaces of transformation and serious equity.\nJohn Berges\nMay 9, 2023 at 9:29 am\nI am a Professor of Biological Sciences, trained in Canada and working in the US.  For the past couple years, I have been PI in a National Science Foundation program aimed at improving the university experience for our students with disabilities (NSF Eddie Bernice Johnson INCLUDES Initiative: The Alliance for Students with Disabilities for Inclusion, Networking, and Transition Opportunities in STEM; https://tapdintostem.org/).  In doing this, we have engaged some of the very few faculty with disabilities and had some tough conversations with them and with out Accessibility Resource Center.  It’s been troubling, eye-opening, but also gratifying to see that once issues are recognized we are capable of agreeing and taking action.  As always, allocating resources is at the heart of things…\nTrina Ruth\nJuly 20, 2023 at 1:37 am\nI.have my PhD from the University of Florida.   I have Cerebral Palsy.

I moved from university town to university city, as I was not given a tenure track position.  I published academic articles, presented papers across the U.S. and even had a paper accepted at the Sorbonne, Paris and won a fellowship that paid for my flight and room and board in Paris!  Still, I  was turned down for promotion to the Associate Professor level, which I. Only wanted because it would gibe me a4 class load instead of a 5 class load.   I always stayed employed in one university at a time. My main blessing.  But I was much like a migrant worker,  having t9 leave friends, colleagues and students, chasing employment.   I followed all the rules, to the letter.   I had won teaching awards and over 90% of my students gave me excellent teaching reviews, as cid my peer colleagues! My field is English literature— Victorian literature (typed a 400 page doctoral dissertation with 3 fingers.  I only have the use of my left arm, hand fingers.   At 51 I.needed a shoulder replacement as my left arm and carrying heavy textbooks across a large campus, up stairs, 3 times a day, wore out my left arm and shoulder until it was bone on bone!, The private university was a “Christian “ one, and hsd its own rules, not governed by the State.\nI agree with the writer’s final statement: “ work like Hell!”…if a differentlycabled worker, employee in a non disabled work environment!  It’s literally ashame that North American universities, and I’m sure other kinds of employers treat their differently abled employees so poorly.  I am in my early 60’s, having no committed partner, as, I feel, during those decades I worked round the clock, with no fun, no time for it, except I do admit, I very happily traveled abroad to various parts of Great Britain and the United Kingdom, both for pleasure, and for work, escorting female students..being responsible for them… and Paris, which I thought might seal my future academically, having my paper been accepted…abroad!  Me?  And then winning the finances to fund getting there!   Wow.  And published articles, other Conferences….  I’m not naive.  I know why.  It’s still wrong, and apart from getting a lawyer , I knew not what else to do!\nThis woman will have my name with “PhD earned” engraved on her tombstone!  Later, hopefully than sooner.  If no one else is, for lack of a better word, “impressed” by what I have succeeded in achieving…I know I am!   Perhaps my physical disability has made me over congratulatory to others’ successes, but I do believe positive feedback, especially when well earned, makes us all better humans.  Lately, I do not feel a sense of belonging, anywhere.   I have no children, no committed partner, but, and I am happy about this, I do believe there are hundreds of thousands of my students out there, contributing their own work to the world, hopehully remembering their Dr Ruth who helped them, and listened.   Thank you\nHelen\nFebruary 23, 2024 at 10:03 am\nThis is an important issue. There are numerous hidden ways in which ableism plays out in academia. For instance, ask any of your colleagues who has had the misfortune of having to go on long-term disability what their application for the long-term disability insurance coverage into which they’ve paid since starting employment, has been like. LTD Insurance claims are rejected outright, often leaving people with no income for up to 24 months, while they either: a) make a premature return to work, thereby exacerbating their condition or b) go with no income, while miraculously coming up with the funds to pay a lawyer’s retainer while also figuring out how to survive with no income until the case is settled. Then, when the case is settled, they are required to sign a non-disclosure agreement,  so that the public never finds out the extent to which the insurance system has been abused. AND, LTD only covers 60% of one’s income. I wonder how much is left once the legal fees are paid and any loans needed to survive repaid.\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMore from Features\nFeatures\nInternational students\nInside the life of an international student\nEvery day brings new adventures, challenges and opportunities for a student coming from abroad.\nby\nSelena Phillips-Boyle\nMay 26, 2025\nFeatures\nArts\nNew coalition forms to advocate for art and design universities\nIt’s time to shine light on the impact of art and design schools, say presidents.\nby\nHannah Liddle\nMay 14, 2025\nFeatures\nEnrolment\nSolving the male enrolment puzzle\nIn Canada and around the world, young men are opting out of postsecondary education.

We are not keeping up with other countries, particularly the United States, our largest trading partner. We are at risk of falling further behind as the global economy is upended by the U.S. focus on growing its own domestic manufacturing and technology industries through subsidies, tariffs and reshoring initiatives.\n“Elbows Up” may be a good slogan for an adrenaline rush. However, if we fail to turn this period of adversity into a long-term advantage, the economic impact to our country will be felt by generations to come. We require a bolder, integrated strategy involving governments, industries, and our world-class universities that attract and develop top talent.\nFirst, Canada needs a more tech-savvy workforce, which means training more people in artificial intelligence, data science, and other advanced skills. One of Canada’s greatest weaknesses is that businesses are slow to adopt AI, automation and cloud-based systems, not due to lack of awareness but because they do not have enough skilled workers to use and leverage these tools. We know what we must do, but not how – universities as partners is an answer.\nThe Vector Institute’s 2024 report on emerging AI skills identifies a pressing need for workers with specialized expertise in areas such as machine learning, data engineering and cybersecurity. Digital literacy needs to be a core skill for students at all educational levels, from K-12 and throughout higher education. Industries should be involved in developing curriculums and offering real-world learning opportunities. In today’s economy, we do not just need more people who can write code, we need people who can understand the societal implications of AI, who can design ethical business models, who communicate across sectors, who can connect insights from science and the humanities into solutions. That is what a university education, done right, is built for.\nWe need to broaden our definition of “tech-savvy” so that students and workers can use technology effectively. Humanities, critical thinking and analytical writing skills need to be integrated into tech training to solve the big problems of today and tomorrow.\nSecondly, our universities and industries need to collaborate in areas where Canada has an advantage: critical minerals, the Arctic economy, foreign policy, AI, agrifood, aerospace and clean energy, all come to mind. But above all we need to remember that we are a knowledge-based economy. We must build partnerships that help students gain practical experience and access new ideas. In other countries such as Germany and South Korea, schools and industries work seamlessly to turn research into real-world solutions and drive commercialization. Canada’s postsecondary institutions can do more to break out of our silos.\nEncouragingly, new models – beyond internships – are emerging. The University of Ottawa’s CloudCampus, launched in partnership with the Bell Canada company FX Innovation and CENGN (Canada’s Centre of Excellence in Next Generation Networks), offers graduate training in building cloud systems and retraining opportunities for mid-career professionals. The Creative Destruction Lab, founded at the University of Toronto and now operating at 12 sites around the world, is a global startup program for science-based companies looking for initial funding. At Victoria University, the Centre for Creativity convenes business, academic and creative industry thinkers to find answers to specific questions together.\nCanadian universities can and should lead the way in creating more of these partnerships. With their research capacity, teaching talent and deep community networks, they are uniquely positioned to build bridges between innovation and implementation. Where else in society can you find such deep and broad expertise in one place: scientists, engineers, artists, historians, ethicists, and economics, for example, all working side by side? This diversity of knowledge and perspective is the value universities bring to the table and which will be critical to solving today’s most complex challenges.\nThirdly, government support is vital. Canada must create a culture where innovation is not just fostered, but expected, both in classrooms and board rooms. Tax incentives, matching grants and streamlined funding applications can encourage more businesses to invest in collaborative research and development.\nUnless Canada modernizes its productivity strategy, we risk long-term economic stagnation. But if we can better connect education, industry and research, we will not only catch up with other economies but also create a stronger, more competitive future. It’s time to get our elbows up and all hands in — rolling up our sleeves not just to work hard, but to translate that work into building a strong, resilient economy for everyone.\nRhonda McEwen\nRhonda McEwen is the President of Victoria University in the University of Toronto and Canada Research Chair in Tactile Interface, Communication and Cognition\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

It’s an “historic” milestone, said Denis Gros-Louis, Director General of the FNEC. This partnership strives to offer specially adapted university programs to Indigenous students. A business plan for the House of Knowledge will be submitted to Quebec’s department of higher education by 2027. “All Quebec’s universities were interested in partnering and contributing knowledge to the new institution from day one,” said Mr. Gros-Louis.\nGhislain Picard, former chief of the Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador, noted in a statement: “The House of Knowledge is the result of the tenacity of communities to reaffirm their self-determination in education. It responds to a real need and will contribute to the trend of an increasing number of First Nations graduates observed in recent years. This project embodies the shared vision of First Nations to fully claim control over their education. Fifty years after the national policy ‘Indian Control of Indian Education,’ I am delighted to see this initiative take shape.”\nThe project aims to address educational deficits among Indigenous Peoples by improving graduation rates and increasing the number of qualified teachers.\nBuilding on the Regional Education Agreement\nIn July 2022, the FNEC signed a historic funding agreement with the federal government to address funding deficits for Indigenous schools that dated from 1996. “As our youth become more active and engaged, we noticed that our graduation rates were a bit behind,” noted Mr. Gros-Louis. “Our chiefs concluded it was time we ran our own higher education network.”\nFNEC is using its Kiuna Institution as a learning hub while they work on establishing research chairs and attracting experts over the coming years. As academic success rates rise among Indigenous students, the need for an entirely Indigenous university is more pressing than ever.  “The goal is to make university education accessible to First Nations students, whether in urban or remote communities, by benefitting from experiences of Quebec universities,” says Mr. Gros-Louis.\nThe First Nations university will be created in several stages based on three priorities identified by First Nations Regional Chiefs. The first is to quickly prepare students to enter the workforce, which requires the institution’s financial needs to be met within the first 18 months. The second and third are to align the university with First Nations values and traditions and consider how best to root it in their cultures.\nA survey is currently underway to identify the specific needs of individual communities, especially where workforce and training are concerned. Regional Chiefs are tasked with making decisions based on the anticipated knowledge and workforce requirements of the next 15 years.  “Healthcare and education are themes that often come up,” explained Mr. Gros-Louis, “as do language and culture. I also hear more and more about using and modernizing traditional knowledge to achieve food self-sufficiency and reduce remote regions’ dependence on the biofood industry.”\nThe plan also anticipates partnering with the Regroupement des centres d’amitié autochtones du Québec (Native Friendship Centres of Quebec). This association will play an important role in the project, especially in orienting First Nations students to university life and contributing to logistics and support, including housing and student well-being.\nAlthough the institutional board will be comprised of First Nations members with the aim of meeting the needs of Indigenous Peoples, the House of Knowledge will be open to all. In the 2000s, Mr. Gros-Louis also contributed to the creation of First Nations University of Canada in Saskatchewan where he managed the federal Indian land registry. Though he wasn’t present at its inauguration, he has visited it many times and followed the project closely. He noted that Saskatchewan’s example can inspire, but that First Nations in Quebec have totally different needs. “The project’s business plan has to be approved by the government,” he added. “Reports will be sent every six months to keep the Ministry informed and involved. The project is progressing well. We hope to have a concrete opening date very soon.”\nMarie-Lou Bernatchez\nMarie-Lou Bernatchez is a francophone journalist at University Affairs.\nTags\nFirst Nations\nPremières Nations\nQuébec\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

There are intersecting pieces, some of which we show more of and some less, depending on the relationships we are forming or maintaining. We situate ourselves as two Indigenous people who were predominately raised outside of our cultures and are working daily to reconnect with them in various ways. We position ourselves as cis females, graduate students in a doctor of education program, and educational practitioners in the post-secondary sector of British Columbia, with a passion for promoting education to other Indigenous peoples across Turtle Island.\nLearner success in higher education in Canada is subjective, context-based and can be defined differently by every practitioner. Still, post-secondary staff, faculty and administrators commonly observe that learners can be empowered to achieve success if they have strong support systems throughout their learning journey.\nIndigenous learners face a unique set of barriers to education that is deeply rooted in systemic and historical racism within the Canadian education system. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s 94 calls to action implore the federal government to eliminate the gaps in education between Indigenous and non-Indigenous learners (call to action #7). Post-secondary institutions can address this gap by creating Indigenous programs with Indigenous communities and their people and participating in the local protocols and traditions of the nations where they are guests. Indigenous education, where curriculum and practices are centred around Indigenous knowledge, culture, and ways of being, contributes to success in the form of engagement, retention, graduation rates, transitions to the workforce and contributions to communities.\nOne example of this step is a “circle of support” as a key element in strengthening learner success. The circle could be comprised of Elders, family members, friends, colleagues, and/or past educators. Each person holds the possibility to both support and challenge the learner. As educators, our interactions with students carry significant weight, influencing their journeys throughout post-secondary education. Building relationships with Indigenous students from the start of their journey shapes how they see our presence — not just as a figurehead or institutional representative; instead, as a trusted member in their inner circle playing a meaningful role in their journey.\n“Aboriginal families and communities have a special role in this [life] journey – to foster a strong collective identity and provide wisdom for their children and youth as they engage in lifelong learning” (Battiste, 2010).\nNicola Valley Institute of Technology, based in B.C., has been a trusted partner to Indigenous communities across Canada for over 40 years. Their enduring relationships have been instrumental in developing community-based assessments, which help guide program delivery within the community for prospective learners interested in attaining a post-secondary education. The results from the assessments may mean completing a college readiness program before starting to work towards a post-secondary certificate or diploma, to better prepare students for success.\nThis comprehensive community-based assessment service includes an opening prayer from a community Elder, community assessment preparation, assessment invigilation (English and math), and assessment review. Commitment to each prospective learner is further demonstrated through co-creating individual education plans. These plans are tailored to each student’s unique needs and aspirations, ensuring a personalized and supportive learning journey. The summary highlights the individual learner’s educational priorities and identifies broader educational opportunities for the community. The assessment process also provides prospective learners with the experiential learning and information necessary to start and return to their journey into post-secondary education.\nMeeting the learners within their Indigenous communities to promote education demonstrates a commitment to understanding their Indigenous community operations, unique protocols and traditions. As post-secondary educators, we are accustomed to structured operations. However, the approach to community-based assessments necessitates a shift towards flexibility. This flexibility, which may involve travelling into remote communities via plane, boat, or car, sends a powerful message to the learner that you and your post-secondary institution are committed to providing unwavering support. Commitment to meeting them where they are is the first step to strengthening the circle for Indigenous learners.\nOur own journeys into numerous Indigenous communities across BC have been a testament to the transformative power of education. We have witnessed the growth of learners from their first hesitant steps to the triumphant moment when they walk across the stage at graduation. It is a source of immense pride to see a learner who may not have engaged with education for a significant period, may not have graduated from high school, or may be directly transitioning from high school, realizing that their life experiences have propelled them to a higher level of assessment than they had anticipated. And then, to be present at their graduation ceremony as they receive the credential they once thought was beyond their reach is a genuinely inspiring experience.\nWe challenge other post-secondary institutions to look beyond on-campus learner support and engagement and to collaborate with Indigenous communities and their supporters to offer more holistic opportunities for Indigenous learners. We recognize that taking this step towards reconciliation may be challenging for higher education institutions that still operate within colonial frameworks and we offer the BCCampus Pulling Together Indigenization Guides as a starting point for guidance and tools. What is unequivocally clear is that the need to support learner success across the post-secondary landscape needs to match the learners entering our campuses, classrooms, offices and hearts. This shift can begin at the micro level, with each individual seeing themselves as part of a circle of change and with the goal that at the macro level, education responds ethically to the call to action of Indigenous learners.\nTessa Quewezance & Amanda Street\nTessa Quewezance is a project officer at Four Pillars Society.

Hiring more Indigenous faculty was a key strategy to achieve the reconciliation goals. By 2018, only 1.4 per cent of all faculty self-declared as Indigenous. But since then, the number of emerging Indigenous scholars has continued to grow.\nExperiences of Indigenous faculty\nInitially, many Indigenous academics engaged actively in university reconciliation efforts. However, there is growing frustration with the performative nature of many actions. There is an expectation now for more settler allies to lead reconciliation efforts, allowing Indigenous faculty to focus on the deeply transformative work of resurgence and decolonization. These competing goals create tension within the ethical spaces of engagement. Consequently, Indigenous faculty often experience isolation, deficit theorizing, racial microaggressions like tone policing, tokenism and systemic racism and colonialism in their workplaces.\nWhile senior Indigenous faculty endured these challenges, such experiences are no longer acceptable as a rite of passage for new scholars. Senior Indigenous faculty can play the role of academic Aunties and Uncles, supporting emerging Indigenous scholars in navigating these experiences in ways that allow them to thrive.\nThe Emerging Indigenous Scholars Circle (EISC)\nThe EISC at Royal Roads University, launched in August 2023, with the hiring of two scholars. When our school of business hired an Indigenous scholar she was invited to join the EISC. The plan is to hire two Indigenous scholars per year, for three years. Each scholar is offered a three-year term in a department that aligns with their academic and research strengths.\nAs chair, I affirm the strengths that these younger scholars already possess. I provide individualized coaching and mentorship in ways that support their work. For instance, we discuss course planning complexities that integrate Indigenous ways of knowing for settler and visiting students.\nWe debrief situations where they wish they had been more assertive in meetings and strategize on addressing tokenism. We explore the imposter phenomenon and how it upholds patriarchy and colonialism. I invite senior Indigenous scholars from across Turtle Island to meet with them to build connections. These senior scholars share their experiences regarding establishing research priorities, preparing for annual review and handling difficult conversations with colleagues. Their encouragement and support are invaluable.\nWho are emerging Indigenous scholars?\nEmerging Indigenous scholars are diverse, motivated, inspiring, intelligent and accomplished. They maintain deep connections to their communities, bringing to the academy their nations’ cultural and linguistic traditions. These ways of knowing guide them to conduct their academic work with integrity. These scholars have earned graduate degrees across a wide range of disciplines. They possess a worldly perspective and a profound understanding of colonial influences within academic institutions. Having navigated Indigenous and colonial knowledge systems with persistence and resilience, they have overcome significant barriers and surpassed expectation. In my opinion, emerging Indigenous scholars embody the skills, knowledge and visionary leadership needed to address ongoing settler colonialism, the climate crisis and societal conflict. They are at the forefront of advancing resurgence and decolonization.\nLessons learned so far for the EISC\nWe learned that while many of our settler colleagues are eager to work with us, they often report that they learned very little about Indigeneity during their own university experiences. As such, I point them toward the widely available resources so that they continue to address their own learning needs. By doing so, this creates space for the emerging Indigenous scholars to learn their academic craft without the burden of having to teach our colleagues.\nThis year, we cherished the privilege of working openly and honestly with one another. We created space for serious discussion and boisterous laughter. We identified institutional gaps and barriers, which I have worked to address. We have had much to celebrate. These emerging scholars have revised and taught courses, published papers, and presented at conferences. They engage in committee work and contribute to the academic enterprise, enhancing the Indigenous presence on our campus.\nMy relationships with these emerging scholars are the best part of my job. They inspire me. I thrive on their stories and our laughter. I cheer them on as they complete their dissertations and rock their conference presentations. I listen proudly as they share their impactful teaching moments, and feedback they receive. I root for them when they stand up for themselves and advocate for one another. It has been a great year. And we are growing. We are excited to welcome the next two emerging Indigenous scholars to the circle this summer.\nIf you would like to develop your own mentorship program for new Indigenous faculty please reach out.

But where do universities fit in, and how should they be contributing?\nBy\nCatherine Couturier\nJanuary 25, 2024\nPosted in\nArticles\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nRead this article in French\n0 Comments\nCanadian academics have helped launch a number of initiatives to revitalize Indigenous languages in recent years. They’ve compiled dictionaries, created an online platform to teach the Wolastoqey language, begun studying and documenting Innu vocabulary used to describe the environment and set up an intensive course in Algonquian language teaching methodologies. And when the United Nations educational, scientific and cultural organization announced the Indigenous Languages Decade, the Canadian academic community stepped up with projects to revitalize some of Canada’s 70 Indigenous languages.\n(Re)building trust\nYet despite their goodwill, researchers are in a difficult position. “Universities are colonial institutions,” said Mélanie Leblanc, a professor of sociolinguistics at Université de Moncton’s Edmundston campus and co-director of the SQOTESOL research team. “I’m not convinced they should be taking the lead in this matter.”\nInstead, academics should create partnerships with communities to better understand and respond to their needs and do so with the utmost respect to research ethics. Jimena Terraza, a linguist at Kiuna College, agreed. She is helping the Innu community of Mashteuiatsh build its own revitalization plan. “It’s not up to me to make the decisions,” she said. “I’m just here to provide an external perspective and offer pointers on what to look out for.”\nResources for all levels of learners\nThere are plenty of programs to support beginners. However, researchers lament that there is a dearth of resources for speakers who already grasp the basics of their language. “In talking with our Indigenous partners, we realized that few programs were aimed at more advanced learners, and most were in English,” said Dr. Leblanc.\nSeeing a need to increase cultural support for the two francophone Maliseet communities, she partnered with the Madawaska Maliseet First Nation and the Wolastoqiyik Wahsipekuk First Nation to set up a Wolastoqey language learning platform called Wiciw (meaning “together with”). Funded by Canadian Heritage, the platform makes language learning more accessible to people who can’t attend classes or don’t have access to classes in their community.\nTeaching future generations\nResearchers recognize that a university can never take the place of a community. “What you do as an academic isn’t always useful for communities,” said Darin Flynn, a professor of linguistics at the University of Calgary. “Ideally, it’s young children who should be learning the language. Universities can’t help much with that.” Dr. Terraza agreed. “Only speakers can revitalize a language. But universities still have a role to play in teaching others.”\nFor example, researchers can help train future educators or solidify their language skills. “We have expertise that these communities don’t always have, such as in linguistics, storytelling, or pedagogy,” Dr. Leblanc added.\nYoung people with university training in linguistics can then use what they’ve learned to support their communities. “The transition through postsecondary education can have a beneficial effect, especially if students reconnect with their identity, which is at the heart of everything,” Dr. Terraza said.\nFor Marie-Claude L’Homme and Yvette Mollen, working with local stakeholders is also a way to give back to future generations. The professors in the linguistics and translation department at Université de Montréal (U de M) joined forces with the Institut Tshakapesh for\na research project on environmental terminology in the Innu language. Ms. Mollen sees the project as a way for her to give back to future generations. “We need to make sure the elders keep speaking, so the young can learn,” she said. “Language is wealth.”\nA demand for resources\nOne of the challenges researchers encounter is finding proficient speakers, especially in communities where the language is rarely spoken. “There are so few Wolastoqey speakers left, and they’re all involved in multiple projects. Naturally, we’re not necessarily a priority – which makes sense,” Dr. Leblanc said.\nDr. Terraza set up an intensive summer program to try to offset the lack of language resources, bringing together some 50 students from Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, Université du Québec à Chicoutimi and Kiuna College. Her aim is to train the next generation of speakers how to teach their Algonquian languages (Innu-aimun, Atikamekw Nehiromowin, Anishinaabemowin and Abenaki). “Their languages are increasingly taught in schools,” she said, “but the demand for resources is high. Few people are available to take on the task. It’s a huge problem.”\nVisibility and outreach\nBy supporting local initiatives, “research gives communities the ammunition to bolster their demands to governments,” Dr. Leblanc said. Dr. Flynn believes academics also have a role to play as communicators. “We can work to dispel the myths that cause languages to disappear, the first being that monolingualism is the natural state of things.” He points out that children have the ability to learn multiple languages simultaneously, and that multilingualism is the global norm, not the exception.\nUniversity language courses ultimately serve more a symbolic purpose than a practical one. “I don’t think these courses help revitalize languages,” said Ms. Mollen, who teaches Innu-aimun, “because they don’t directly reach the speakers. But they certainly give our communities more visibility, and I am trying to dispel prejudices.”\nRevitalize a language, save the culture\nKeeping Indigenous languages alive is good for society. When the language thrives, the culture is likely also thriving. “A living language is one that connects children with their grandparents. Focusing on language benefits every member of a community,” said Dr. Flynn.\nDr. L’Homme argued more funding is urgently needed to support communities in their revitalization efforts. “There is an urgent need.” Because otherwise, we risk losing some languages completely. And when a language dies, according to Dr. Leblanc, “we lose an entirely unique way to view the world.”\nCatherine Couturier\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

It took seven years of interviews, massive public gatherings and a 60-million-dollar investment to belatedly raise Canadian dialogue on Indigenous peoples, raise awareness of “Indian” residential schools and uncover the unmarked graves of Indigenous children who never returned home from those institutions.\nMy own contributions to the early years of the TRC were to mobilize youth and bring their voices and skills into the process. The Canadian Roots Exchange (CRE) worked with multiple young people to inspire art, conversations and even host a Toronto-based truth and reconciliation gathering. In 2015, I was appointed as an honorary witness by the commission and since then have dedicated substantial time and effort to increasing dialogue with people and organizations across Canada. In 2016, I was invited by the newly established National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation at the University of Manitoba to become a member of the governing circle, a group I have chaired since 2019. I was also appointed in 2016 by Lakehead University as the first Indigenous chair for truth and reconciliation in Canada.\nEach of these processes have informed the activity and extension of knowledge on Indigenous contributions and challenges by the Canadian state. They have also had the effect of inspiring “Truth” conversations modelled on the Canadian TRC process amongst Indigenous peoples in other parts of the world.\nIn 2020, I was invited to participate in discussions with the Finnish government and the Sami Nation as they opened their Truth Commission. This past October, I was invited to visit Tromso, Norway and Stockholm, Sweden to discuss truth and reconciliation with members of the Sami Nation in both countries, Canadian ambassadors to Norway and Sweden, truth commissioners in both countries, Sami, Norwegian and Swedish scholars, as well as members of the Church of Sweden.\nThrough these meetings, I learned that discriminatory events in Canada mirror discriminatory events in Norway and Sweden. Norwegianization and Swedification mandates in both countries served to sever Sami language from the Indigenous population; interference in the transmission of cultural values, access to jurisdictions and authorities over lands, medicines, reindeer, and children were very similar to the Canadian Indigenous experience; and the establishment of the “Truth” Commissions were going to be handicapped by similar paternalistic thinking and governmental dictates.\nWhat did I contribute? My participation in a conference titled “Truth and Reconciliation Processes in Stable Democratic States: Who, How, and What Happens After?” was to explore what the Canadian context could offer the Nordic experience. The invitation noted, that “given the ongoing or impending TRC processes in Sweden, Finland, and Denmark, the insights and outcomes from the TRC in Canada are resonating profoundly throughout the Nordic region.” I was invited along with a colleague to opine on the challenges and gifts of the TRC and the 94 Calls to Action. I am regarded as a very forthright individual and I did my best to encourage the newish Truth Commissions to broaden their mandates, employ deep listening strategies to Sami Nation history and contemporary desires, and to let go of the need to control, limit, or dictate truth commission outcomes.\nI also visited Taiwan in November 2023, where I spoke at a conference hosted by the Council of Indigenous Peoples on Truth and Co-existence. This was a new concept and approach for me, but I believe it has great utility for extending the dialogue in many interesting ways. The concept of co-existence refers to “the state or fact of living or existing at the same time or in the same place.” Indigenous peoples would agree on the need today for “peaceful” coexistence based on concepts upheld in the Guswentha (Two-Row wampum), the Dish with One Spoon Wampum, other tools of co-existence – some of which pre-date contact on this continent – and concepts represented in the peace and friendship treaties initiated on the east coast of Canada.\nI consider these invitations a great honour and representative of the lead Canada has taken on rebuilding nation to nation relations with Indigenous peoples. However, we still have a considerable distance to go before we can mutually agree on our progress towards reconciliation, or even peaceful co-existence. Canada has embarked on a generational process, and our ability to inspire dialogue globally is a testament to the tenacity as Indigenous peoples to not only survive but thrive and ensure the truth is acknowledged and never forgotten.

Today, they are flourishing: Canadian universities offer nearly 30 programs in the field. The growing professionalization of the sports industry is causing the surge — but can the job market keep pace?\nThe world of sports is a highly lucrative market under rapid expansion, and specialized managers are needed to help the industry grow. According to Dr. Michael Naraine, associate professor in sport management at Brock University, the rise of sports administration programs is directly connected to the trend towards professionalization. “One of the main reasons sport management and business have grown recently is the surge in popularity of the sports industry,” said Dr. Naraine. “The industry requires an increasing degree of professionalization and deeper knowledge.”\nMajor international events like the Olympic Games, the FIFA World Cup, and various world championships have drawn attention to sports’ complex organizational and business needs and spawned new jobs requiring specialized skills in subfields including sport management, marketing, law and finance.\n“Attention should be paid to what these programs have to offer and whether students can find jobs after graduation.”\nSpecialized training, narrow market\nSports administration programs offer a combination of theory and practice, providing students a solid foundation in management while immersing them in real sports industry environments. “As a business, the sports industry functions similarly to the automobile, finance, and consumer packaged goods industries,” Dr. Naraine explained, “with one major difference: the main product is intangible. When it comes to sports, the consumer experience is created and taken in simultaneously.”\nTheoretical foundations in sociology, psychology and management are essential to ensure sports managers bring added value to sports organizations, argued Dr. Naraine. The practical side of these programs enables students to experience the tangible and intangible elements of sports while applying their theoretical foundations in different contexts. “Employers don’t expect students to be fans, but rather to be well-informed, data-driven and conscientious,” he added. “They need to be trained for the current needs of the sports industry in Canada and abroad, not industry needs in the 1980s and 1990s. This is why many business schools categorically opposed sports as a program in the past — they didn’t know how to manage both the theoretical and practical aspects of this growing and hybridized industry.”\nGraduates of these programs can pursue a wide variety of careers in sports. Professional and amateur sports organizations, clubs, leagues and federations provide jobs in operations, recruitment and player performance analysis. In sports marketing and communications, they can develop partnerships, sponsorships and branding. Event planners are also needed to organize competitions and manage relationships with sponsors and media, while the subfield of sporting infrastructure and services offers opportunities in stadium operations and the development of community sports.\nA limited job market\nBut the Canadian job market remains relatively small. Frank Pons, director of the Observatoire international en management du sport at the Université Laval’s faculty of business administration, cautioned against creating more university programs in the field if there aren’t enough available jobs in the market.  “There are only a few positions being offered in Canada,” he said. “It’s not a significant job market compared with the United States or even Europe. Attention should be paid to what these programs have to offer and whether students can find jobs after graduation. The number of large employers in sports is so limited here — except maybe in Toronto, where the market is well established.”\nThough jobs in this field are attractive, salaries don’t always meet expectations. “There are certainly jobs managing sports organizations and planning events,” added Dr. Pons. “Governance and leadership are also major subfields. But it’s harder to find work with large professional sporting organizations because, quite simply, there are fewer jobs here than in other fields.”\nGrowing recognition from business schools\nThe tepid job market hasn’t stopped Canadian universities from planning and developing new sports administration programs. Previously relegated to physical education departments, sports management is gaining recognition in business schools, with some universities — including Brock University — partnering with them to develop their sports administration programs.\n“At Brock, we are proud to launch a master’s program in sport management delivered jointly with the Goodman Business School,” said Dr. Naraine. “This partnership demonstrates the essential role the field of management studies plays in sport management. To date, only one MBA program specializing in sports exists in Canada, but more and more MBA programs in the United States are integrating sports content into their curricula, including the University of California at Los Angeles and the University of Michigan.” This trend points to the growing role sports play in the economy, and the need for future managers to be trained in the field’s financial realities and strategies.\nThe uptick in sports administration programs in Canada reflects how rapidly the field is evolving: as industry needs change, more programs marry theory and practice to produce qualified professionals. But balancing training opportunities with the realities of the job market is key to avoid oversaturation. In the meantime, these programs strive to develop future talent for an increasingly professionalized industry.\nDaisy Le Corre\nDaisy Le Corre is a Canadian writer and editor, who has been published both in Canada and France.\nTags\nSports\nSports\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Keep reading to find out how they’re taking action today.\nBy\nMégane Girard, Catherine Roy-Boulanger, Félix Guay-Dufour, Benjamin Gallais, Julie Lane & Marc-Antoine Tourville\nMay 08, 2025\nPosted in\nIn My Opinion\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nIllustration by: Dusan Stankovic\nRead this article in French\n0 Comments\nStudent mental health (SMH) has become a major concern for higher education in Quebec—one that has elicited an unprecedented collective effort. Student associations, institutions, Quebec’s Ministry of Higher Education, the Observatory on Mental Health for Students in Higher Education (OSMÉES, Observatoire sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur), and the Initiative for Student Mental Health in Higher Education (ISMÉ, Initiative sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur) are dovetailing efforts to gain a better understanding of the deepening challenges linked to SMH and roll out effective action tailored to institutions’ needs.\nStudent demands around mental health: a background\nThe “Behind the Mask” campaign—spearheaded by the Quebec Student Union (QSU) in 2018—marked the beginning of increased collective SMH awareness, in addition to serving as the vanguard of large-scale mobilization around the issue. Thousands of students responded to the survey and the results painted a worrying picture of their mental health, often due to academic stress, social isolation, financial pressures, and performance. The QSU and the Quebec Federation of College Students (FECQ, Fédération étudiante collégiale du Québec) authored two additional SMH surveys during the pandemic, both of which yielded results confirming the distressing situation revealed back in 2018.\nStudent associations then used this data to buttress their demands for increased mental health support, putting pressure on the Ministry of Higher Education to draw up a more structured framework. The ministry began working towards this goal in 2019, and in 2020 held a wide-ranging consultation process. In 2021, the Action Plan for Student Mental Health in Higher Education (PASME, Plan d’action sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur) was launched to provide a coherent framework for equipping post-secondary networks with guidelines towards improving SMH. Also in PASME’s crosshairs: supporting the expansion and diversification of psychosocial health promotion, prevention and support services offered in colleges and universities.\nOSMÉES: knowledge in synergy\nGrowing out of PASME and funded by the Quebec Research Fund (FRQ, Fonds de recherche du Québec), OSMÉES has been vested with a scientific mission to contribute to the advancement and mobilization of knowledge to promote and maintain a culture that supports student mental health in higher education. With 26 research focus areas and 275 members, the observatory addresses the various factors affecting mental health in post-secondary settings, making for an approach to SMH that is as holistic as it is interdisciplinary. OSMÉES’ research focus areas don’t merely overlap—they are active and essential co-participants in a synergistic exchange of knowledge. The observatory boasts more than fifty students on its active membership roster who, among other initiatives, take on co-leadership roles to steer the organization’s various focuses. OSMÉES leans into a “by and for” students approach, directly involving them in governance and across projects.\nFrom November 4 to 22, 2024, the observatory deployed a nationwide study on student mental health in higher education to 1) get a clearer picture of SMH and its evolution over time, 2) create sub-population profiles that reflect the diversity of student populations, and 3) assess needs around psychosocial counselling assistance, its access, and its use. Data collected from this research will be fundamental to gaining a better understanding of the current state of student mental health and guiding next steps in terms of future local and ministerial actions to support SMH.\nISMÉ: driving SMH mobilization\nAlso a product of PASME, ISMÉ has a mission to support SMH, as well as contribute to healthy, safe, and welcoming academic settings for students in higher education. It has been tasked with gathering, promoting, and sharing SMH expertise and knowledge, in addition to mobilizing the SMH ecosystem in Quebec.\nAcross its mandates, the organization works for and alongside the post-secondary community, which includes students, student associations, professional staff, mental health staff, teaching staff, support and technical staff, and management, among others. ISMÉ’s mobilization strategy involves providing tools and initiatives that align with the guidelines laid out in PASME while responding to the SMH needs and expectations of the higher education community. ISMÉ taps into its collaborative network to contribute every step of the way.\nIn March 2024, the organization launched the Student Mental Health Station (Station SME), a one-stop destination for SMH information and tools that apply to the post-secondary world. The site promotes trusted content and offers streamlined access to wide-ranging knowledge tailored to the needs of college and university communities. The Student Mental Health Station is geared towards deepening the SMH knowledge and expertise of students as much as staff.\nREAD MORE: Station santé mentale étudiante : un soutien pour le bien-être au Québec (in French)\nJoining forces to support student mental health\nThese complementary bodies are powered by interlocking missions, which is why they have joined forces as well as networks in supporting student mental health. This synergy is the product of a collective effort to transform the SMH landscape and promote mental health as a shared imperative. This mobilization is promising, but there are hurdles on the road ahead, and students’ shifting realities—often characterized by academic stress, social isolation, financial insecurity, and other risk factors—underscore the need for constant and renewed engagement. The effort to provide every student a healthy, safe environment where adequate support is available must continue. By joining forces and keeping this collective movement in forward motion, every stakeholder in the higher education ecosystem can be a part of designing a future where SMH is valued and protected.\nThis article is part of a series on student mental health in higher education supported by OSMÉES (Observatoire sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur) and ISMÉ (Initiative sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur).\nMégane Girard, Catherine Roy-Boulanger, Félix Guay-Dufour, Benjamin Gallais, Julie Lane & Marc-Antoine Tourville\nTags\nOSMÉES\nUnion étudiante du Québec\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

The cooperative in international student recruitment works to “champion Nova Scotia as a leader in the international student experience while advancing social and economic growth in the province.” That mission – which once seemed so straightforward – has become much more challenging in the last year. So has the job of running the province’s universities, thanks to changing federal and provincial government policies and a lack of consultation with administrators.\nThe country’s second-smallest province is home to 10 universities – the highest concentration of institutions per capita in the country – and an extensive community college system consisting of 14 campuses. Of the 10 universities, six are situated in the capital city of Halifax: Dalhousie, Saint Mary’s (SMU) and Mount Saint Vincent (MSVU) Universities, Nova Scotia College of Art and Design University (NSCAD), Atlantic School of Theology (AST) and the University of King’s College. The remainder are sprinkled throughout the province: Cape Breton University (CBU) in Sydney, St. Francis Xavier University (StFX) in Antigonish, Acadia University in Wolfville and Université Sainte-Anne in Church Point.\nAccording to the Association of Atlantic Universities (AAU), the number of full-time graduate and undergraduate students in Nova Scotia in 2024 was 44,140. An additional 11,052 students were enrolled in programs at Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC).\nThose enrolment numbers are significant in a province that has a population of just over 1 million, according to Statistics Canada, and is facing demographic challenges as the populace ages and as the number of deaths outpaces the number of births. The provincial government, led by Premier Tim Houston, has been relying heavily on immigration to grow the population; between July 2022 and July 2023, Nova Scotia’s population grew faster than during any other period in its history, due in large part to a sharp increase in net non-permanent residents (a large portion of whom are international students) as well as immigration and interprovincial migration. The province also has its eye on doubling the population to two million by 2060. That means the attraction and retention of students – particularly international students – plays a vital role in supporting the province’s economic goals.\nA deep concern\nIn October 2023, 14,567 international students were enrolled at Nova Scotia-based universities. But in December 2023, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), led by then-Minister Marc Miller, announced an increase of more than 100 per cent in the cost-of-living financial requirement of international students, from $10,000 to $20,635. Then, in January 2024, IRCC made a snap announcement of a 35 per cent cut in the number of international student permit applications it would allocate across the country. That announcement was followed by another in September 2024 suggesting a further 10 per cent nationwide cut was coming in 2025.\nBy October 2024, the number of international students enrolled at Nova Scotia universities had dropped 14.4 per cent, to 12,476, according to numbers provided by the AAU.\nThe federal government’s moves caught universities off guard. “These policy changes were a real kick to positive trends in previous years,” says Peter Halpin, executive director of the AAU. “[They] have implications, not just for our universities, but for regional economy and population growth strategies.”\nIn response, the AAU commissioned a study by Gardner Pinfold Consultants to measure the economic impact of the IRCC’s cap on international students throughout the Atlantic provinces. The report found that the shortfall between actual and expected international student enrolment between 2023-24 and 2024-25 resulted in an estimated regional loss of $163 million in spending, $165 million in provincial GDP, $94 million in provincial income and 2,231 full-time equivalent jobs, in addition to a decline of $22 million in provincial tax revenues and $17 million in federal taxes lost. And with more than half of the international students in the Atlantic region, Nova Scotia is experiencing the greatest impact from the cuts.\nBut not all universities in Nova Scotia were affected equally. The province was tasked in 2024 with disbursing its allocation of 11,565 international study permits (out of 12,900 in total, including private colleges) among all 10 universities and NSCC. As with all provinces, international students would require a Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL) confirming that the student has a place within the province’s allocation under the cap.\nCBU was hardest hit. The school, which began as Xavier Junior College in 1951, became Cape Breton University in 2005. That year, the institution had 2,905 full-time students, 208 of which were international students. The number gradually rose (there were 721 visa students in 2015; 1,982 in 2018; 3,952 in 2022) until 2023, when the number ballooned to 6,939 out of a total full-time student body of 9,138. That number of students overwhelmed the small city of Sydney, which has a population of around 30,000 – putting a strain on housing and employment.\nIRCC’s changes meant CBU’s provincial allocation of international study permits in 2024 was 5,086 – down 52 per cent from the previous year. (The actual number of international students enrolled at CBU in 2024 was 5,764, which includes returning students who did not require a provincial attestation letter to apply for a visa because they already had a study permit.)\n“The financial pressures on the postsecondary system are acute. I think those have been building up slowly over time.”\nCBU president and vice-chancellor David Dingwall declined to be interviewed for this article, but he spoke with CBC Radio’s “Information Morning Cape Breton” on Jan. 2, about the impact of the international student cap. He acknowledged that CBU’s enrolment needed to be reined in, pointing out that the university had developed a strategic enrolment plan before “all of this” to take total enrolment back to 7,000. Now CBU is facing a loss of around 1,200 international students, which he said amounts to “anywhere between $15 and $20 million” in lost revenue.\n“I’m disappointed in the Government of Canada for the way in which they have preceded on this particular topic,” he told CBC. “No consultation ever took place with universities across the country.”\nUniversité Sainte-Anne, at the other end of the province, also took a hit. In 2024, international students at the small francophone university made up 26 per cent of the 560-strong student body, based on their enrolment data. “We’re highly dependent on international students,” says president and vice-chancellor Kenneth Deveau. Sainte-Anne’s international recruiting efforts focus primarily on French-speaking sub-Saharan African countries.\nDr. Deveau says these potential students typically face challenges in obtaining the required documentation and securing funds, which means the conversion rate – the number of students who are admitted versus the number who enrol – can be less than five per cent.\n“[Admitting] an international student is a long and cumbersome process and much more so now that these [PALs] are in place,” says Dr. Deveau. “We used to admit some 2,000 students a year to get maybe 15 new students.” Sainte-Anne’s 2024 provincial allocation was 962, down 34 per cent from 2023. Dr. Deveau says the university admitted “somewhere around 350 students.” In the end, just 146 international students enrolled.\n“There’s a budget impact there for us,” he says. “We’re looking at probably a half a million-dollar revenue hit on a $25 million budget. That’s not insignificant.”\nEven the NSCC system is impacted. President Don Bureaux says international students in 2023 made up about 10 per cent of the student body, but the most recent federal limits will take that down to three per cent in September 2025. “It is a hit to us,” he says. “It’s going to hurt us financially. We’re going to have to make some changes.”\nThe long-term impacts of the IRCC policies are a major priority for the AAU across the board. “We have a deep concern that Canada’s brand internationally has been badly tarnished by these IRCC policies,” says Mr. Halpin, noting that the AAU made “overtures” to then-Minister Miller to propose a program that aligns with government goals while recognizing the importance of international students to the region.\nRobert Summerby-Murray, outgoing president of SMU, chair of the AAU, chair of the board of directors of EduNova and vice-chair of the Council of Nova Scotia University Presidents (CONSUP) says recruitment has become a challenge for all of Nova Scotia’s postsecondary institutions, including his own.\n“These policy changes were a real kick to positive trends in previous years.”\n“People are just not applying, because the message we get from our recruiters is: Canada is not welcome to me. I will apply elsewhere,” he says. “Canada was the number one destination for international students globally and we threw that away because of the miscalculation and misunderstanding on the part of the government of Canada and the lack of action on the part of our provincial governments.”\nDr. Summerby-Murray says the federal government failed to understand that when it “turned the tap off” on Jan. 28, 2024, the flow could not just be “turned back on again” on March 31. “That was a gross assumption; a complete miscalculation,” he says. “For many universities, and Saint Mary’s is one of them, we are looking at [losing] 50 per cent of our international students.”\nThat created a significant challenge for an institution that was already struggling with international student enrolment. In 2023, SMU faced a deficit of $9.7 million in its operating fund; by 2024, the deficit was down to $3.3 million.\nBilateral agreements\nThe IRCC’s policy changes weren’t the only challenges that caught Nova Scotia’s postsecondary sector by surprise in 2024. In early February, two weeks after the federal government’s announcement of the cap on new international student study permits for Nova Scotia, then-Minister of Advanced Education Brian Wong declared that the existing five-year memorandum of understanding between the province and Nova Scotia’s universities would be replaced by separate bilateral one-year funding agreements\nwith each of the province’s 10 universities.\nUniversities did not see this coming. CONSUP released a statement calling the one-year funding plan “extraordinarily distressing news.” Mr. Dingwall, chair of CONSUP, said in the statement that the lack of consultation or nego­tiation “undermines any sense of partnership, collaboration or vision for the future of one of the province’s most strategically important sectors.”\nThe agreements placed a two per cent cap on tuition increases (previously capped at three per cent) for all Nova Scotia undergraduate students, a minimum tuition increase of nine per cent for first-year international undergraduate student tuition (except for Dal and the University of King’s College, because of an increase in the previous year), and tied a portion of funding to performance targets that included a requirement to fill health program seats to an average enrolment rate of at least 97 per cent. They also required universities in Halifax and Cape Breton to add more student housing options.\nThe province provided a two per cent increase in annual operating grants for most universities, up from one per cent in the expiring MOU signed in 2019. Dal’s grant was the same as it had been in 2023-24.\n“Government has successively reduced funding at the provincial level, so our base operating grants as a percentage of operating have reduced probably 10, 12 percentage points over the last decade,” says\nDr. Summerby-Murray. “At the same time, our costs of operating our universities – labour costs, utilities costs – continue to rise at four and a half or so per cent each year, so provincial government funding has\nnot kept pace with that.”\nBy September, Dal – the largest degree-granting institution in the prov­ince with more than 21,000 students in 2024 – announced it was facing a budget shortfall of $18 million and instituting a hiring freeze. In an internal memo, president and vice-chancellor Kim Brooks cited declining inter­national enrolments through the COVID years and “the events of this past year – both geopolitical and related to changing government policy” – as factors in the university’s challenges.\n“The financial pressures on the postsecondary system are acute. I think those have been building up slowly over time,” says Dr. Brooks in an inter­view. She acknowledges one way Dal has traditionally addressed those pressures has been through the admission of international students, who pay tuition as though they’re not at publicly funded institutions.\nDr. Brooks doesn’t see any sort of potential rescue by the provincial government in the future. “I think it is probably unrealistic for universities in this province to imagine that there is going to be a provincial government funding increase that will fix this challenge in a way that won’t mean we’ll have to do at least some work to think about how we design the kinds of offerings we have,” she says.\nAffordability\nMeanwhile, postsecondary students in Nova Scotia are struggling to afford an education.\n“We’ve had the highest tuition for domestic undergraduate students from within the province for quite some time,” says G Saleski, executive director of StudentsNS, a self-described not-for-profit and non-partisan advocacy group that represents Nova Scotia postsecondary students. Domestic undergraduate students in Nova Scotia pay 36.5 per cent more than the national average for full-time tuition – according to data from Higher Education Strategy Associates – although the province has a tuition bursary for domestic undergraduate students amounting to $1,283 for full-time students. Dr. Summerby-Murray says CONSUP has been lobbying to see that bursary increased because it hasn’t changed in about a decade.\nMany areas of the province lack adequate affordable housing; campus food banks are also under growing pressure to help reduce the financial burden on students.\n“When universities are struggling to keep funds coming through the door with decreased budgets from the government, it’s of course students that are on the receiving end of the dollar signs going up,” says Mx. Saleski.\nStrategic alignment with government\nNova Scotians are also facing a growing inability to access health care, with failing health infrastructure and shortfalls in the numbers of available doctors and other healthcare workers. The provincial government’s one-year bilateral agreements with universities include requirements for Acadia, CBU, Dal, MSVU and StFX to provide proof that 97 per cent of the seats in their health programs are filled in order to meet the province’s payment terms and obtain a portion of their funding. All universities are also required to develop strategic alignment plans that outline how they will advance government priorities.\n“I don’t think it’s anything new that governments would be looking for more direct outcomes – outcomes that are connected specifically to particular demand in the job market,” says Dr. Summerby-Murray. “We are in a period of a greater emphasis on vocation rather than long-term education. And at the university level, we need to be cognizant of that. We need to show the link.”\nBy late January 2025, Dal had met the requirement of reaching 97 per cent of its seat allocations in health programs and had submitted a required strategic alignment plan, triggering the release of $34 million in provincial government holdbacks, according to a more recent internal memo that was circulated. That won’t relieve the budget pressures on the university entirely but has helped with the current year’s shortfall; in January 2025 the school was still facing a $10 million budget deficit – the first time Dal has ended the year with a deficit since the early 2000s. (Dal’s budget advisory committee requires that the operating budget must be balanced.)\nMSVU’s May 2024 budget showed a $200,000 shortfall, which it attributed to the province’s two per cent increase to the university’s operating grant “while the cost of operating the institution is rising and at a rate that outpaces the two per cent increase.” The budget noted that this year’s international student enrolment projections were established at the same number as last year, “as it is difficult to predict what the actual impacts of the Federal government’s unexpected policy change will be.”\nStFX’s 2024-25 budget reflects a deficit of nearly $5 million; the document pointedly says: “The government has decided to abandon the MOU process and the consultations that occurred with the university presidents. Instead, the government has mandated a one-year agreement. The terms of this agreement were not discussed with the university presidents before being presented to the public.” It also notes “vulnerability around enrolment” and expresses concern that “if the target of 97 per cent of [nursing] enrolment is not achieved, the university will lose three per cent from the operating grant and may not get the full allotment of the nursing grant.\nSurprises keep coming\nThe provincial government continues to spring surprises on the postsecondary sector. Since a provincial election in November 2024 that led to a supermajority for Premier Tim Houston’s Progressive Conservatives, there had been little to no communication about what was coming until February 2025, when newly appointed Minister of Advanced Education Brendan Maguire, who declined to be interviewed for this story, introduced Bill 12 – An Act Respecting Advanced Education and Research.\nThe bill would amend the University Accountability and Sustainability Act to give the minister sweeping authority over the composition of boards of governors as well as the authority to require a university experiencing financial hardship to “enter into a revitalization process” in which the province can withhold funds if the institution fails to comply. It would also give NSCC the power to grant undergraduate degrees.\nThe day before, the Conservatives had also introduced an omnibus bill that would have hindered the role of the auditor general. After significant public criticism, the premier backed down, and on March 4, 2025, Nova Scotia Auditor General Kim Adair released her report on funding to universities, which found that the Department of Advanced Education was not effectively monitoring or holding universities accountable for public funds amounting to more than $2.5 billion over the last five years.\nAnd there’s still no clarity on international student allocations.\nOn Jan. 24, IRCC announced the 2025 provincial allocations under the international student cap. Nova Scotia will receive 8,297 permits. Master’s and doctoral students will now also be required to submit PALs. At the time of writing, the minister had not yet allocated those permits to the universities.\nThat uncertainty, combined with continued questions around what’s coming when the current bilateral agreements expire on March 31, weighs on Peter Halpin and the members of the AAU.\n“We have to be optimistic about the future,” he says. “All of our universities have plans and they very much want to execute those plans, but they are publicly funded universities. And to that end, they require greater support from both the federal and provincial governments to make these plans come to fruition to the benefit of students.”\nAngela Mombourquette\nAngela Mombourquette is an award-winning freelance writer and editor based in Halifax, NS.\nTags\nDalhousie University\nNova Scotia\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(2 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Against a background of U.S. President Trump’s threats to our economy and sovereignty, Mark Carney has reignited Liberal prospects after what had seemed an assured election victory for Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre.\nAmidst the turmoil, Canadian universities find themselves in a state of great uncertainty, exacerbated by the tighter cap on international student study permits. As universities have increasingly relied on international student tuition to fund their programs, repercussions are taking a toll not only on the country’s economy but also on its reputation as a preferred destination for higher education.\nIn the wake of growing financial challenges and the rise of conservative voices questioning equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) policies, the role of higher education institutions in society is facing increased scrutiny. Yet in the current election campaign the parties seem to be placing these issues on the back burner. Will the plight of universities figure in this election, or will they remain at the margins of political debate as their future becomes less certain than ever?\nA pivotal time for EDI\nA conservative riptide emanating mainly from the United States but also from some Canadian provinces is being noticed by university administrations. EDI initiatives and associated funding are particularly under fire. The University of Alberta, for example, has moved away from the language of EDI in favour of a new framework emphasizing access, community and belonging. This announcement echoes skeptical arguments that claim universities’ EDI policies and investments are ideological in nature.\nYves Gingras, professor of history and sociology of science at the Université du Québec à Montréal, is among the vocal critics of EDI policies. He argues that these initiatives are built on shifting sands and serve an ideology rather than a true academic objective. “EDI advocates are ideologues,” he says. “They can never clearly define what it means.” He argues that diversity policies constitute bureaucratic interference in university research, a domain that he believes should be defined solely by academic excellence. “If someone asked me how my work on the Renaissance contributed to sustainable development goals, I would find that absurd,” he says. “Now they want to add EDI. What is EDI in this context?”\nIn contrast, others within the academy see EDI initiatives as essential to the democratic role universities play in society. Marc Spooner, a professor in the faculty of education at the University of Regina, warns against mounting resistance to EDI policies. “It’s easy for someone to say they don’t like EDI,” he says, “but once you explain what it means — equity, diversity, and inclusion — its rejection becomes much harder to justify.” For Dr. Spooner, rejecting EDI is no minor matter: it’s part of a broader trend rejecting the social sciences and humanities, and the sciences more generally. He remembers when Stephen Harper’s Conservative government did away with the mandatory long-form census — a crucial tool for public research and planning. “His willingness to get rid of the long-form census showed a real contempt for data, evidence, and science in general.” Today, he observes a similar tendency in Pierre Poilievre’s Conservative Party, which has floated the idea of introducing “free speech guardians” to monitor campuses — an initiative Dr. Spooner finds dangerously interventionist.\nFour decades of federal investments in research and innovation\n1982: Founding of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR)\nDespite being founded two years before Brian Mulroney took office, CIFAR received support from his government to advance cutting-edge interdisciplinary research in Canada.\n2000: Creation of the Canada Research Chairs Program\nIn 2000, the Chrétien government created this program with $900 million in funding to establish 2,000 research chairs by 2004–05. The program’s goal is to attract and retain world-class researchers in Canadian universities.\nThe attacks are not solely on EDI initiatives, he adds, but on the democratic role universities play in society. Fields such as postcolonial studies, gender studies, and equity and diversity programs have become prime targets for conservatives. “Attacking these disciplines threatens our peaceful coexistence and our ability to understand each other.”\nDr. Spooner is concerned that Canada will follow the United States in politicizing higher education, which has led to budget cuts and control of universities by an increasingly authoritarian Trump administration. “University boards have been politicized,” he says, “and university presidents are becoming increasingly politicized. Yet it is crucial that universities remain independent institutions to successfully play a critical role in society.”\nA distinct Canadian context\nAlex Usher, president of Higher Education Strategy Associates, posits that critics of EDI initiatives are unlikely to follow the same path in Canada as they did in the United States. “Some think Trump’s approach in the U.S. will push the Canadian right to adopt similar policies, but I think that’s completely misguided,” he says. Rather, opponents to EDI initiatives will find it more difficult to achieve radical ends in Canada than they do in the United States, where the EDI debate has evolved.\n“Trump has made it impossible to presume any good faith among opponents to EDI initiatives,” notes Mr. Usher. “It has become starkly apparent that many critics of EDI in the United States aren’t just opposed to diversity initiatives — they’re opposed to civil rights. There is no presumption of good faith in these debates.”\nIn Canada, however, Mr. Usher believes arguments will remain moderate. “I don’t think we’ll see much action against EDI in Canada,” he asserts. However, he notes that some critics, particularly in Alberta, are basing their critique of EDI policies on a more subtle rejection of national issues, especially as they relate to residential schools.\nMr. Usher points out an interesting paradox in how EDI policies are managed in Alberta: “The provincial government campaigned openly against EDI. It’s difficult for a university to hold out against that. I think the University of Calgary and the University of Alberta are trying to present this as a simple change of tack without giving the impression of total capitulation.” Though he finds validity in criticism of EDI initiatives, he recognizes the value of diversity in recruitment. On the other hand, inclusion initiatives can sometimes slow down decision-making in establishments already perceived as sluggish. “You can be for EDI or against it,” he says, “but it’s a matter of give and take.”\nA checkered Liberal legacy\nThe heated debate over EDI policies is hardly the only transformation universities have undergone during the Trudeau government. For almost a decade, the Liberal Party has shown strong support for scientific research and higher education by increasing budgets for granting agencies and creating the position of chief science advisor. But these advances have been matched by more controversial decisions, including recent restrictions on international students. What will be the legacy of the Trudeau government, now in the rearview mirror, on the university sector?\n2008: Launch of the Canada Excellence Research Chairs Program\nStephen Harper’s Conservative government established this program to attract world-renowned researchers to Canada by awarding substantial funding to establish innovative research programs.\n2017: Creation of the post of Chief Science Advisor of Canada\nJustin Trudeau’s Liberals created this office to provide the government with independent advice on science issues and to ensure that scientific knowledge helps shape public policy.\nMr. Usher notes that while the government has announced significant investments in research, much of this funding remains hypothetical: 88 per cent of the promised injection would not materialize until after the next election.\n“It may happen,” he admits, but cautions that it all depends on the next government. A continued Liberal government could release the funds, but a Conservative victory may put these commitments in jeopardy.\nTo Mr. Usher, this is emblematic of the Liberal higher education legacy as a whole: innovative ideas, but inconsistent implementation.\nThis lack of follow-through is not limited to research. In 2019, Ottawa had announced an ambitious plan to encourage continuing education with tax incentives. “They forgot about this completely,” says Mr. Usher. No assessment, adjustment or mention of the plan appeared in subsequent budgets.\nSimilar improvisation also seems evident in the recent changes to international student policy. Mr. Usher acknowledges that abusive practices by certain private institutions forced the government to act. “Was it a smart move? I would give it a B-.” He is especially critical of the poor planning and rushed decision-making, which seemed to take place “by scribbling notes on cocktail napkins.” What’s worse, he adds, is that the more universities voiced their concerns, the more the government believed it was on the right track.\nInternational students in the crosshairs\nDr. Spooner highlights the Trudeau government’s considerable improvements to the university sector. In his view, the Liberal government sent a clear message about the importance of science, expertise and university scholarship to Canadian society.\nHowever, he is critical of how the government has managed higher education, particularly regarding international students. He feels the government has presented international students as a problem rather than an asset. “These funding cuts have sent the message that these young minds, full of new ideas and perspectives, are not welcome.”\nThis complex issue has been approached hastily, misguidedly and without adequate collaboration with academia, says Dr. Spooner. While progress has been made, the potential for positive outcomes has been hindered by a lack of dialogue with institutions.\nFederal neglect, provincial interference\nDaniel Béland, a political sociologist and professor at McGill University, argues that Justin Trudeau’s record with higher education depends on which years are being examined. “From 2015 to today — that’s a long interval full of important decisions,” he says, “but if we focus on the period since 2021, it’s a different story.”\nDr. Béland, who serves as director of McGill’s Institute for the Study of Canada, says it’s important to bear in mind the structure of Canada’s higher education system. Universities are mainly under provincial jurisdiction, but the federal government does provide financial support, especially for research. It also controls certain policies that influence education, including immigration. He notes that the federal government raised the cap for international students just after the pandemic but lowered the immigration cap shortly thereafter, with renewed attention given to international student numbers.\nHe questions what motivated these policies: “Was it a matter of pure politics? Was it anticipating the election? A combination of both?” He also suggests that, though the main contributor to the housing crisis has been the lack of new housing construction, immigration has been used as a scapegoat. “International students, who are only temporarily present and do not vote, made easy targets,” says Dr. Béland.\nHowever, he acknowledges that some institutions — mainly private colleges in Ontario — were abusing the system in pursuit of financial gain. “But the measures taken also punish public universities and create serious financial problems for them.” Dr. Béland wonders whether a Conservative government might have followed the same track given similar positions expressed by certain Tories. In his view, the Trudeau government’s higher education record varies depending on one’s perspective.\nOn March 23, while addressing journalists to announce the dissolution of Parliament and the start of the election campaign, Mark Carney confirmed that if elected, his government would maintain immigration quotas, including the cap on study permits for international students, until the housing crisis is resolved.\nUniversities off the radar\nDr. Béland is worried about the future of universities. He suspects that matters of research and university funding will be placed on the back burner, especially as international issues like “the Trump situation in the United States” take the spotlight.\nAlso of concern is the growing interference of provincial governments in higher education. In Alberta and Quebec, for example, EDI policies are being increasingly called into question. Dr. Béland believes that Alberta Premier Danielle Smith has “a similar ideological influence as the American Republican Party.” This influence could draw more and more scrutiny to academia as right-wing governments seek to limit what they perceive as “militant and excessive” left-wing influence in universities.\nDr. Béland recommends universities organize and lobby to defend their independence and protect their academic values in the face of these growing political pressures.\nHigher education, though indispensable, is obviously not a political priority. It seems to Dr. Béland that politicians lack interest in academia, especially since the Trudeau government took its controversial stance on international students. Even as the Trudeau administration increased financial support for universities, it normalized a more political approach to education. “Universities and professors are certainly concerned about it, but it’s not a leading issue.”\nIn the current economic and geopolitical climate, universities will be challenged to uphold their value despite their enormous contributions to democracy and society. Now more than ever, it is crucial to resist efforts to undermine them and to reaffirm their importance in this election.\nMohamed Berrada\nMohamed Berrada is the Associate editor, francophone for Affaires Universitaires.\nTags\nEDI\nElection\nInternational students\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

He quit CEGEP at 17 and made some major career strides before deciding to return to school for a certificate in computer science and a Bachelor’s degree from Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM).\nNow in the role of interim General Director of the Fondation de l’UQAM and special advisor to UQAM’s President, Mr. Champagne candidly admits he was a dropout. “I didn’t find what I was looking for at CEGEP,” he confides.  He worked as a commercial custodian and rose quickly through the ranks, taking on management roles from the age of 19.\nHe only returned to school years later, when he was accepted to UQAM via the experience-based admission pathway for his first certificate.  After obtaining a certificate in computer science, he registered in full-time studies at Polytechnique Montréal. All the while, he advanced in his career and received several promotions at Roy and at Polytechnique Montréal, serving respectively as Director of Information Technologies and Procurement, and as Head of Services for Facilities Management. In 2008, he resumed his studies and earned a cumulative Bachelor’s degree in 2015. He has held leadership roles ever since.\nMr. Champagne strengthened his leadership skills by volunteering with organizations such as the Red Cross and Scouts Canada, ultimately becoming Canada’s youngest president and Scouts Commissioner. He held numerous positions with the Association des Scouts du Canada, including Head of Contingent and International Commissioner, between January 1987 and November 2023.\nAlways eager to take on an opportunity to serve the public good, he was also on the programming committee for the continuing education department at Université Laval, served as Vice-President of the Fondation nationale des Scouts between 2009 and 2013, and worked as a first aid instructor and operations manager with the Canadian Red Cross for 17 years.\nIllness and personal challenges\nIn 2023, Mr. Champagne was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)—also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease—at the age of 53. ALS is a serious and incurable neurodegenerative illness that results in progressive paralysis of the muscles involved in voluntary motor skills. “I started to notice strange symptoms and was referred to a neurologist. The final diagnosis came the same day I was flying to India for the International Masters Program for Managers (IMPM),” he recalls in anemotional interview. In spite of his diagnosis, he says he chooses not to let the illness define him and continues to work part-time as a special advisor to UQAM’s president.\n“Every day, ALS robs a little more of my ability to communicate,” he says. Seven months ago, he had to give up handwriting. A month later, he could no longer sign his own name. “Siri is my new sidekick,” he says. “She helps me write my text messages.”\nUndeterred, he finished his thesis and completed the IMPM program with distinction. He feels both proud and determined. “My reputation is intact,” he says. “I always finish what I start.”\nMr. Champagne is all too aware of the challenges faced by people who take unusual paths. That’s why he created the Jean-François Champagne scholarship fund in 2023 to support students accepted to UQAM based on their experience and community involvement. “Higher education allowed me to improve my skills throughout my career,” he explains. “If you believe in higher education and the potential of students with unconventional backgrounds, I urge you to support the Jean-François Champagne scholarship fund.”  In September 2023, he was inducted into the Université du Québec’s Circle of Excellence for his outstanding contribution.\nThrough his extensive network and fundraising efforts, he raised $50,000 for the scholarship fund. More and more students are taking unconventional paths to higher education. “This year, we received more than 3,000 applications for the scholarship,” he says.\nIn January 2025, Mr. Champagne was appointed interim General Director of the Fondation de l’UQAM. His mission is to modernize the foundation and help UQAM adapt to new challenges,.“ The university that offered me an opportunity based on my experience all those years ago,” he concludes, “is the university where I’ll end my career.”\nMarie-Lou Bernatchez\nMarie-Lou Bernatchez is a francophone journalist at University Affairs.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

We have found that TFGV causes major emotional, psychological and professional consequences for targets. We have also learned that even though most institutions know that this is a problem for women and marginalized academics, they don’t really know what to do about it.\nWhile it’s true that we cannot punish random and anonymous perpetrators of online violence, this does not mean that nothing can be done.\nSo how can you support a colleague when they are faced with online harassment?\nHere are five research-backed tips:\n1. Let people know you are in their corner.\nBefore others release a media interview, share their research with the public online, or discuss an issue relevant to their work on social media, scholars need to know who around them can lend a hand if things go wrong. This means letting your colleagues know early and often that you’re there to help, that you support them and have their back. Sometimes this can look like sharing a time when you’ve experienced online harassment so that others can see you know how it feels. Other times, it may involve an invitation to colleagues to let you know when they are publishing their work to the public so that you can watch for trouble.\n2. Be a proactive online commenter.\nStudies have shown that proactive positive comments in an online forum or on an article can help to create an environment where fewer negative comments occur. Similarly, “counterspeech”, that is responding proactively and constructively in the face of online harassment, can have real benefits. As an ally, once your colleague has called you in and alerted you to an online article or social media post that they want your help with, proactively post positive comments or engage in counterspeech to help mitigate any harassment that occurs.\n3. Block, document and report.\nSometimes counterspeech isn’t enough and other actions need to be taken. Usually, we advise targets of gender-based online violence to block, document and report their harassers, but that can feel very stressful and overwhelming if the target has to do it alone, increasing the chances that they will experience burnout or emotional stress. You can be an effective ally by taking on some of this work for your colleague. Some people have told us they have been helped by turning off their social media notifications and enlisting family and friends to help block, document and report harassers. Ask your colleague if they’d like your help with these important tasks, if need be.\n4. Offer support outside of work.\nIf your colleagues experience TFGV, they may need to talk, take a break, or feel like someone is helping them stay safe. You can offer tangible support by offering to take your colleague for coffee or for a walk, picking up a bit of extra work if they need to take time away from their computer, or even walking them to their car if they are feeling worried about being alone.\n5. Help advocate to your employer.\nEmployers can make IT, communications and security support available, and should develop policies and processes informed by faculty for providing support during times of harassment. Most institutions do not have such a framework in place yet, but you can help advocate for one. It should not just fall on the shoulders of targets to provide advocacy at our workplaces. You can be one of the voices asking for additional support, particularly on behalf of your colleagues who may be more marginalized or are less secure in their career (non-tenured or sessional faculty for example).\nBy adopting the above practices, you can make a meaningful difference in the lives of your colleagues who are targeted with TFGV.\nJaigris Hodson\nJaigris Hodson holds the Canada Research Chair in\ndigital communication for the public interest and is an\nassociate professor at Royal Roads University.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

In my experience, career culture shock is a real thing. I felt it when I started my PhD, and throughout my three job changes in the past four years.\nI’ve come to enjoy the excitement of starting a new job — new colleagues, new responsibilities and a new environment. Yet I’ve also felt overwhelmed and struggled with confusion, boredom and uncertainty. Starting a new job can feel tumultuous compared to the comfort of being embedded in a role for years.\nThose working in the postsecondary sector, including graduate professional development staff, are expected to look at a problem and jump in feet first, often without sufficient training or preparation. Whether you’re new to the workforce, at a career crossroads, or moving between institutions, you’ll need to turn this professional uncertainty into excitement. Here are four strategies that can help: understanding your environment, knowing who to connect with, prioritizing your responsibilities and establishing workflow systems.\nResearching your new ecosystem\nAny role has past content and context, even newly created positions. I recommend searching through team folders or looking over past notes to find relevant information. Reviewing key texts and sources within your field is another way to gain insight into the larger environment. I found reading over past meeting minutes helped me understand how programs were previously delivered, especially as I became a lead on them.\nThe goal isn’t to commit everything to memory, but instead to be aware of what happened in the past and build a mental map of where to find information. This process of researching best practices and procedures may also spark new ideas.\nSpinning a web of connections\nRarely are jobs completely siloed, especially in postsecondary institutions. Take the time and effort to meet the people who you’ll be working with and who can influence your work. It may seem scary to reach out to people you don’t know, but most people will be glad to meet the ‘new person’ and share their experiences. Think about questions you can ask them to further build the relationship and how you can add value to their roles.\nDuring the first month of my current job, I focused on meeting people within my own faculty and those in parallel roles in other departments and related organizations. While I don’t directly work with all these people, I still benefit from understanding how they connect to my role. They also now know I exist and what I work on, so they can come to me if they need support.\nUnderstanding the food chain\nIn a new role it is a good idea to quickly understand what is expected of you and how to prioritize your various responsibilities. To start, talk with your manager or team to evaluate the current situation and identify which tasks to focus on first. It’s important to find the easy wins, as this can be the best way to show your value in the short run and demonstrate areas where you can continue to develop.\nWhen starting a new job, I always have lots of ideas. I tend to rush to action, but taking a step back and learning what projects are actually important will have a higher payoff. Prioritizing tasks that are attainable and impactful will help build credibility, which you can leverage down the road.\nCreating and maintaining your own (eco)systems\nThere is considerable research on the “fresh start effect”, suggesting that using a temporal landmark can be an effective method for starting and keeping new habits. Starting a new job is a perfect time to establish your working methods. Set expectations early with your team and manager about how to work together and establish that trust.\nIn the past, I’ve fallen into the trap of compromising my working style at the beginning of a new job in order to be accommodating. The problem is that this type of well-meaning compromise can hurt productivity in the long run. Postsecondary environments offer a high level of autonomy, allowing for some flexibility of schedule and processes. Since flexibility is a double-edged sword, find a way to set boundaries that work for you. By using well-articulated workflow plans and systems, such as calendar blocking, you will be able to focus on getting important work done, even with a lot on your plate.\nThese four strategies all emphasize the importance of taking a steady and sustained approach to a new workplace. By knowing the larger context of your work, through reading and connecting to colleagues, you can accurately discuss with your manager what the future priorities are and where you should focus. Creating processes and systems at the beginning will ensure high quality and efficient working methods down the road.

I know at least one other extremely productive and dynamic academic who also does this, and I am increasingly finding myself drawn to do it as much as I can. The idea is to “theme” your days. What does this mean? It means that, as much as you can, you devote entire days to particular areas of your academic life or work and focus on those exclusively on those days, with the exception of email, teaching classes, or other things that you may not be able to control.\nFor instance, Mondays are my “Get Things Done Day”. This is when, even if I am teaching and have meetings, I focus on the daily administrative tasks, emails and reports that are part of my job. Monday is generally a day of greater energy, but it is also time to “warm up” for the week, and you might not feel like doing heavy writing or research after a lull on the weekend. Power through your to-do list on this day, getting as much out of your inbox and off your desk as possible. This might be a good day to plan the rest of the week, as much as you are able.\nTuesdays for me have traditionally been “Teaching Day”. Even if I am not teaching classes that day, I grade, do course prep, gather and organize whatever materials I will need for teaching that week, and meet with students. You might want to have office hours on this day, as a way of staying in touch with students and your teaching mission. In the afternoon, I might work on scholarship of teaching and learning projects, committee work around teaching and curriculum, and I might read some literature on teaching.\nWhen I was a dean, I tried to put as many of my meetings on Wednesday as humanly possible. This was my “People Day” and, although it sounds exhausting, it is actually enjoyable to spend time talking to colleagues all day without other tasks interfering. It also provided me with many to-dos that I would get to the next Monday, on my “Get Things Done Day”. The same thing could be done for research, writing, retreats, or any other aspect of your job that you can devote most of a day to.\nWhy is this so powerful? Well, it reduces task switching and the cognitive load of changing modalities and projects all through the day. Instead of ricocheting between email, calls, meetings, course prep, reports, classes, groceries, and laundry, you put your whole attention, your deep work as Cal Newport has called it, on one area of concern. One of my colleagues who was the executive director of a major inter-university collaboration used Mondays to meet with her direct reports, Fridays to meet with those outside of the institution, Tuesdays and Thursdays for her own research and writing, and Wednesdays a massive all-day teaching day (she had a course release so could do two huge seminars on Wednesdays). This allowed her to get a lot done without losing her mind.\nThe system doesn’t have to be perfect, and in fact, a little distraction from other areas and activities can be quite refreshing much of the time. However, the focus you can get from theming days in this way is a game-changer, and although you usually cannot choose when your classes meet, you probably have more control over the rest of your schedule than you realize. You will want to work with some pre-existing structure to decide what days to theme when, but remember that you will get more tired as the week progresses, so perhaps activities and tasks that take less cognitive horsepower should be saved for days when you are freer, or more refreshed, than others.\nAlthough this system works for academic work, it can also be used for other aspects of your busy life. I try to have all my appointments (medical, dental, etc.) on Thursdays, particularly Thursday afternoons, because I have a very heavy day on Wednesdays with my current schedule and I am tired by Thursday afternoon. Recently I had five medical appointments in one day, and although it was busy, imagine all the commuting and waiting time I saved by scheduling them in this way.\nThe best thing about theming days is that it gives you a sense of control that may be a little optimistic but still leaves you feeling like you can get done what you need to get done with more focus, less distraction and more relaxation. We can all use that.\nElizabeth Wells\nElizabeth Wells is a professor of music history and musicology at Mount Allison University as well as author of the book The Organized Academic.\nTags\nTeaching\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

The parties are now in a sprint campaign, making their case to lead the country through a tumultuous time with a trade war — exacerbating the ongoing affordability crisis — and threats to Canadian sovereignty by the Trump administration. To learn where each party stands on postsecondary education, according to their platforms and statements from party leaders during the campaign, see the list below, which will be updated weekly throughout the election.\nLiberal Party of Canada\nUnder the new leadership of Prime Minister Mark Carney, the Liberal Party would:\nProvide $10 billion in low-cost financing and capital to affordable home builders. Of this amount, $2 billion will be allocated to developing new student housing in partnership with the provinces.\nInvest $100 million over four years to attract leading researchers to Canadian institutions through a Canadian Sovereignty and Resilience Research Fund. Eligible researchers could include professors and graduate students and researchers whose U.S. funding has been cut and are working on projects that could directly benefit Canada, according to the platform.\nInvest $108 million over two years in Indigenous postsecondary education to improve access to education for First Nations, Inuit and Metis students, including investments in the Inuit Nunangat University and the First Nations University of Canada.\nCreate a capstone organization to “ensure the federal granting agencies are driving mission-driven research.”\nInvest $750 million over two years into medical schools and residency positions. The Liberals would also recruit health researchers, increase funding for research grants and infrastructure at hospitals and other health care institutions.\nInvest $311.7 million in Canada Summer Jobs in 2025-26 and $198.3 million over two years in the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy.\nExpand the mandates, “where appropriate”, for the Student Work Placement Program, the Youth Employment and Skills Strategy, Canada Summer Jobs and the Canadian Service Corps.\nInvest $20 million over two years into postpartum maternal health which includes sexual and reproductive health research for women and the 2SLGBTQI+ community\nInvest $46 million over four years to expand Canada’s AI institutions that connect researchers and startups to increase commercialization of AI of research\nCreate a scholarship for francophone students who continue their postsecondary studies in French in a minority context.\nConservative Party of Canada\nOfficial Opposition Leader Pierre Poilievre released his platform on April 22. According to the section on its Quebec platform, the party would:\nPut an end to the “imposition of the Woke ideology” in the federal public service and in the allocation of federal funds for university research\nAccording to the Conservative Party’s policy declarations on its official website, a Conservative government would:\nEnd to the “imposition of woke ideology” in the federal civil service and in the allocation of federal funds for university research\nIncentivize federal funding to universities that have “implemented the Chicago Principles” to “protect free speech on campus.” Failure to protect free expression “would result in losing federal funding.”\nImplement a “competitive review process with enhanced transparency and accountability” to determine Tri-Council grant recipients and “restore merit” by directing hiring practices associated with research funding “away from ideology.”\nCreate a single authority for distribution of research funding.\nCreate a Chief Scientist modeled on the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology in the U.K. to advise the government and coordinate science policy nationally and internationally.\nCreate an independent Canada Education Transfer targeted at postsecondary education. It would be funded at a base level, to be negotiated with the provinces, and increase annually according to inflation and demographic growth.\nSupport a three-year prohibition on embryonic research and ensure the federal government “encourage[s] the granting agencies to focus on more promising adult (post-natal) stem cell research.” The party wants federal regulation in assisted human reproduction and related research that would “respect human individuality, integrity, dignity and life.”\nIntroduce income-contingent repayment for federal student loans following graduation.\nMake interest on student lines of credit tax-deductible.\nBuild a system for recognizing international credentials by implementing equivalency exams, creating criteria for equivalent Canadian professional statuses and investing in bridging programs.\nNew Democratic Party\nThe NDP, under leader Jagmeet Singh, would:\nMatch funding to the provinces and postsecondary institutions for the construction of affordable student housing.\nCoordinate the allocation of study permits to postsecondary institutions that have a “credible and affordable” student housing plan.\nIncentivize partnerships between business, nonprofits and postsecondary institutions to convert office spaces for dormitory-style student housing\nForgive up to $20,000 of federal student debt.\nPlace a moratorium on student loan payments and give graduates five years before requiring initial payments.\nCommit to working towards tuition-free postsecondary education.\nInvest in Northern Ontario’s medical schools in rural, remote and underserved communities and train more doctors from the North\nSupport French-language postsecondary institutions such as Université de Hearst and Collège Boréal\nBloc Québécois\nThe Bloc Québécois, led by Yves-Francois Blanchet would:\nFund an intensive recruitment effort for Americans in cutting-edge research fields, including artificial intelligence, biomedical and cleanteach.\nSupport the implementation of a Canadian quantum strategy that recognizes Quebec’s role in advancing quantum technology.\nRedistribute federal research funding for more balance between regions. The BQ noted that 12 of Canada’s 15 largest research institutions are outside of Quebec.\nReinvest in research and development to improve productivity and competitiveness given the global trade war.\nSupport French-language research and publications.\nProvide funding for the province, colleges and universities for student housing initiatives.\nCollaborate with the province to narrow the parameters around international student immigration without compromising the regional university model.\nPromote freedom of expression and oppose censorship, the exclusion of public debate, and restrictions on topics discussed in public spaces, “particularly in universities, the media and legislative assemblies.”\nAdvocate for increased federal transfer to the provinces. The BQ believes education should be the area of exclusive provincial jurisdiction.\nThe Green Party of Canada\nCo-led by Elizabeth May and Jonathan Pedneault, the Green Party would:\nCancel federal student loan debt and abolish tuition for postsecondary institutions. The party says this would cost $10.2 billion annually.\nBudget $10 billion to support postsecondary schools with “mentorship, student-professor contact, inclusive policies and tenure-track hires.”\nDouble and triple the quotas for PhD and master’s scholarships, respectively.\nSupport postsecondary schools in minority-language communities.\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nTags\nElection\nPolitics\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(5 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

No thanks.\nReply\nRb\nApril 9, 2025 at 10:51 am\nI agree.  Sounds very much like what is happening to the US universities right now — less freedom and more control.\nReply\nElizabeth\nApril 7, 2025 at 10:59 am\nThe Liberals’ postsecondary plan misses the mark. Freezing loan interest doesn’t fix rising tuition or student debt. Too much gov’t talk, not enough real change. No help for international students, and their promises (like more campus mental health support) feel empty without a clear plan. Still no path to actually lowering tuition! Just more bandaids\nReply\nED\nApril 7, 2025 at 12:15 pm\nThe NDP’s student housing and debt plan may sound appealing, but it’s full of unrealistic promises and costly ideas with no clear path forward. $20K in student debt sounds generous, but it’s unfair to those who paid their way and doesn’t fix rising tuition costs. And promising free tuition without a real funding plan? Just another empty promise!\nReply\nAndreas Park\nApril 23, 2025 at 2:24 pm\nI’m sorry but the Liberal government wants to get re-elected and therefore must also be assessed on their “accomplishments” over the last decade. So what do we have? Oh, I remember, the immense damage that the current government’s sledgehammer approach to capping international students has done to universities, programs, and prospective and accepted students. These blunt policies, pushed through against all advice to the contrary have thrown back our collective efforts to make Canada a go-to place by at least a decade, and they have harmed our domestic students, too. I’m also for looking into the future with hope, but elections are also a referendum on the track record of the present government.\nReply\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMost popular\n01\nCareer Advice\nAdvice\nSSHRC Insight and Insight Development Grant\n02\nCareer Advice\nPolicy\nThe limits of graduate professional development\n03\nData vs MAGA\n04\nCareer Advice\nWriting\nTeaching students the connection between writing and thinking\n05\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity News and Careers\nSubscribe\nAD\nAdvertisement\nFlight 302\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity of Ottawa President and Vice Chancellor Marie-Eve Sylvestre\nFeatured Jobs\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Cybersecurity)\nUniversity of Regina\nPsychology - Assistant Professor (Speech-Language Pathology)\nUniversity of Victoria\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Master of Data Analytics)\nUniversity of Niagara Falls Canada\nBusiness – Lecturer or Assistant Professor, 2-year term (Strategic Management)\nMcMaster University\nEducation - (2) Assistant or Associate Professors, Teaching Scholars (Educational Leadership)\nWestern University\nView all jobs\nMore from News\nNews\nAccessibility\nNeurodiversity in Canadian postsecondary education\nMore support and recognition needed according to Conference Board of Canada report.\nby\nSparrow McGowan\nMay 15, 2025\nNews\nEquity\nThe Scarborough Charter and addressing anti-Black racism among francophone postsecondary institutions in Quebec\nUnder the charter, Canadian postsecondary institutions pledge to establish frameworks to eliminate anti-Black racism from their campuses.\nby\nCaroline Samii-Esfahani\nMay 15, 2025\nNews\nPolicy\nPostsecondary education welcomes new government\nUniversities will be critical to economic growth, say leaders.\nby\nHannah Liddle\nApril 30, 2025\nNews\nJudge overturns Quebec’s tuition hikes on out-of-province students\nThe decision is a partial victory for McGill and Concordia universities.\nby\nHannah Liddle & Mohamed Berrada\nApril 25, 2025\nMore from Policy\nCareer Advice\nPolicy\nThe limits of graduate professional development\nThe gap between permanent academic positions and the number of PhD graduates.\nby\nDavid Lafferty\nJune 02, 2025\nFeatures\nPolicy\nThe challenges facing Nova Scotia’s postsecondary institutions\nUnexpected government policy changes have choked off revenues while rising costs threaten to topple painstakingly balanced budgets.\nby\nAngela Mombourquette\nApril 23, 2025\nFeatures\nPolicy\nUniversities at a political crossroads\nCanadian universities are facing uncertain prospects as they weigh the\nLiberal Party’s mixed record on postsecondary education against\nConservative threats to EDI initiatives and research funding.\nby\nMohamed Berrada\nApril 16, 2025\nNews\nPolicy\nRethinking the role of social sciences and humanities to help drive innovation and productivity\nTed Hewitt, president of the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada, discusses the need to think differently about how we measure and report the impact of humanities-related research.\nby\nUA Staff\nJanuary 23, 2025\nThe University Affairs Newsletter\nKeeping Canada’s university community informed, inspired and connected\nEmail\nPhone\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n26291\nTopics\nAcademic freedom\nAdvice\nArtificial intelligence\nClimate change\nCopyright\nEquity\nIndigenous\nInternational students\nMental health\nResearch\nPublishing\nTeaching\nIn-depth\nFeatures\nNews\nArticles\nPeople on the move\nCampus Currents\nOpinion\nArticles\nSubmissions\nCareer Advice\nArticles\nSubscribe\nWays to subscribe\nPodcast\nRead the digital edition\nUniversity Affairs\nAbout us\nContact us\nAdvertise\nIssue archives\nJobs\nSearch Jobs\nUA Footer Symbol\nUniversity Affairs\nUniversity Affairs\nFacebook\nYoutube\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nAccessibility\nCopyright\nUniversity Affairs Privacy Notice\n© Universities Affairs 2025.

What it does say is that scholarly output is diverse.’\nBy\nShauna McGinn\nMarch 31, 2025\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nIllustration by Olivia Lennox with sources from Mohamed_hassan, Chakkree_Chantakad, OpenClipart-Vectors, Clker-free-vector-images\nRead this article in French\n3 Comments\nTwo years into his faculty appointment at the University of Winnipeg, exercise physiologist Yannick Molgat-Seon applied to renew his funding from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC). “They emphasized that they had recently signed on to this San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment,” he said. Though he hadn’t heard of the concept, known as DORA, he read up on it. “I thought it was great, and I figured since I’m funded by this group, I would sign it myself.”\nCreated in 2012, DORA is a set of principles aimed at expanding how academic research is judged, by encouraging less weight on traditional metrics like journal impact factor (which scores research by the number and type of journal publications). According to the mission statement, DORA encourages institutions to consider a wide range of impact measures, “including qualitative indicators such as influence on policy and practice.”\nThe University of Winnipeg hasn’t signed DORA, but individual researchers can; in fact, of the 981 Canadian signatories to DORA, just seven are postsecondary institutions. The University of Calgary was the first to sign in 2021, followed by three Quebec institutions: Université de Sherbrooke, Université de Montréal and École de technologie supérieure (ÉTS), part of the Université du Québec network. The University of Victoria and Mount Allison University signed last spring; Concordia University signed in December.\nThe Tri-Agencies – the federal funding bodies of NSERC, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) – signed jointly in 2019, writing that DORA fit with existing policies on open access publishing and their equity, diversity and inclusion action plan.\nReasoning was similar at the U of C, said William Ghali, vice president of research. “DORA came along on a backdrop of some considerable institutional traction,” he said, noting that the university’s leadership had been developing a research assessment framework that emphasized stronger engagement with the wider community.\nWithin that, Dr. Ghali said DORA serves as a guide to help researchers internalize that philosophy and view their work in a new light. “For us, DORA is about how academics judge themselves,” he said. “Our own research excellence framework is about the accountability of researchers to tell the story of what they did with their work.”\nU of C leadership also incorporated DORA into hiring, advancement and awards processes, encouraging researchers to implement the principles in their applications. Dr. Ghali said he and other leaders led a process of “socializing” DORA among the university deans, emphasizing its expansive nature. “DORA never says publication or traditional scholarly output doesn’t matter,” Dr. Ghali said. “What it does say is that scholarly output is diverse.”\nChristie Hurrell, the university’s associate librarian specializing in research support, has worked closely with DORA’s implementation; part of that has been communicating that it isn’t meant to replace anything. “It’s more about creating room for different types of things, as opposed to making people who are happy in the current system change what they’re doing,” she said. She added that herself and other librarians have long been aware of flaws with the journal impact factor, which was originally developed as a tool for librarians to categorize journal subscriptions.\nOf all disciplines, science has traditionally relied on publications as the gold standard, which is part of the reason DORA was created by academics from scientific backgrounds. At the UdeS, Jean-Pierre Perreault, vice president, research, said he expected resistance to DORA from his colleagues in science, but instead found many were ready for the change. The conversations, he said, were to the tune of: “I don’t want to know the number of papers you’re publishing. I want to hear something about the real impact for society of what you’re doing.”\nDr. Perreault gave the example of former UdeS professor Réjean Hébert, a renowned geriatrician who developed the functional autonomy measurement system, a diagnostic tool to assess the needs of elderly patients. “He published that in a journal review with an impact factor of two,” Dr. Perreault explained. “However, there’s about 20 million people around the world every year that are using that questionnaire.”\nAs with Dr. Ghali, Dr. Perreault said hiring and advancement have been one of the concrete ways DORA has shown up in their institution, and leadership at other DORA-signatory universities agree.\n“It helps leaders to make sure that we’re taking into account the full range of scholarly outputs,” said Richard Isnor, provost and vice-president at Mount Allison. As a small institution, Dr. Isnor said DORA serves as a unifying guide for their advancement processes, where it’s common for faculty from various disciplines to adjudicate candidates. Dr. Isnor said DORA also helps amplify their work overall. “Smaller universities like us have had to work hard to make sure the research output of our scholars is being treated equitably by researchers, or by the scientific community in bigger universities with different expectations,” he said.\nDr. Molgat-Seon agreed that DORA can help manage expectations for faculty at smaller universities, where there may be fewer resources for research and teaching responsibilities can be greater. “Instead of the publish-or-perish mentality that people often fall into, I’ve shifted my focus towards publishing a few less articles and focusing on doing those things at a high quality, and disseminating the information,” he said.\nWith relatively few universities having signed, there’s no guarantee that the wider postsecondary community will assess research with DORA principles in mind. Even for signatories, DORA isn’t a binding document.\nBut Dr. Isnor, who spent many years working for NSERC, says he thinks it fulfills an important piece of large-scale change. “There’s an educational and awareness-building aspect to it, and that is one type of policy instrument that organizations and governments use,” he said. “It helps us as institutions when we share the information and explain why we signed. It reflects a commitment to certain kinds of principles.”\nFor Christie Hurrell at the U of C, DORA is hovering at a turning point. “We’re in between that top-down socialization of these new ideas, and the friction with people that are trying to go through the system as it’s changing under their feet.”\nShauna McGinn\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(3 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

But neither is true. This initiative will inevitably serve to limit and devalue basic research, most of which is performed in universities in Canada and is already underfunded.\nReply\nLetitia Henville\nApril 14, 2025 at 11:35 am\nDORA says that you shouldn’t judge the quality of a piece of scholarship based on the journal in which it is published. Specifically, it says: “Do not use journal-based metrics, such as Journal Impact Factors, as a surrogate measure of the quality of individual research articles, to assess an individual scientist’s contributions, or in hiring, promotion, or funding decisions.”\nI don’t understand why it would be bad for fundamental research to have its quality judged based on its quality rather than on a proxy.\nAm I missing something here, Jim? Is there a reason that you think that JIF is good for basic research?\nReply\nVirgilio Valente\nApril 7, 2025 at 10:42 pm\nThe publish or perish culture is unfortunately so strong and pervasive, that when it comes to evaluating a researcher’s profile, the number of publications is still considered the most critical metric. It’s also the easiest way to assess a researcher’s scientific impact. Other factors such as social, educational impact, training quality, knowledge creation, etc. are not easy to measure and incorporate into quantitative metrics and require a deeper level of assessment. Hence, when it comes to hiring, tenure, promotion and grant allocation the number of publications is often used as key indicator of the researcher’s quality (“this researcher publishes a lot” sounds better than “this researcher has published one very high quality paper over the last 5 years”). The DORA is a great step in the right direction but are we sure than even the institutions that signed it are truly following its principles?\nReply\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMost popular\n01\nCareer Advice\nAdvice\nSSHRC Insight and Insight Development Grant\n02\nCareer Advice\nPolicy\nThe limits of graduate professional development\n03\nData vs MAGA\n04\nCareer Advice\nWriting\nTeaching students the connection between writing and thinking\n05\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity News and Careers\nSubscribe\nAD\nAdvertisement\nFlight 302\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity of Ottawa President and Vice Chancellor Marie-Eve Sylvestre\nFeatured Jobs\nBusiness – Lecturer or Assistant Professor, 2-year term (Strategic Management)\nMcMaster University\nPsychology - Assistant Professor (Speech-Language Pathology)\nUniversity of Victoria\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Master of Data Analytics)\nUniversity of Niagara Falls Canada\nEducation - (2) Assistant or Associate Professors, Teaching Scholars (Educational Leadership)\nWestern University\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Cybersecurity)\nUniversity of Regina\nView all jobs\nMore from News\nNews\nAccessibility\nNeurodiversity in Canadian postsecondary education\nMore support and recognition needed according to Conference Board of Canada report.\nby\nSparrow McGowan\nMay 15, 2025\nNews\nEquity\nThe Scarborough Charter and addressing anti-Black racism among francophone postsecondary institutions in Quebec\nUnder the charter, Canadian postsecondary institutions pledge to establish frameworks to eliminate anti-Black racism from their campuses.\nby\nCaroline Samii-Esfahani\nMay 15, 2025\nNews\nPolicy\nPostsecondary education welcomes new government\nUniversities will be critical to economic growth, say leaders.\nby\nHannah Liddle\nApril 30, 2025\nNews\nJudge overturns Quebec’s tuition hikes on out-of-province students\nThe decision is a partial victory for McGill and Concordia universities.\nby\nHannah Liddle & Mohamed Berrada\nApril 25, 2025\nMore from Research\nOpinion\nResearch\nCancelling Congress wounds humanities research\nBudget squeeze and logistical complexities leave the century-old conference without a host.\nby\nMichael Holden\nJune 10, 2025\nOpinion\nResearch\n“Mission-driven” is not a bad word\nWhen non-scientists help set research priorities, society can tackle big problems together.\nby\nSandra Lapointe\nMay 29, 2025\nArticles\nResearch\nThe C150 Research Chairs program is ending, but its scholars are staying rooted in Canada\n‘This is the moment to triple research funding in Canada,' urges renowned scientist.\nby\nHannah Liddle\nMay 29, 2025\nNews\nResearch\nEmojis … as rhetoric?\nA new course and lab at U of T Mississauga delve into these digital images 😀\nby\nDiane Peters\nApril 07, 2025\nThe University Affairs Newsletter\nKeeping Canada’s university community informed, inspired and connected\nEmail\nEmail\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n45861\nTopics\nAcademic freedom\nAdvice\nArtificial intelligence\nClimate change\nCopyright\nEquity\nIndigenous\nInternational students\nMental health\nResearch\nPublishing\nTeaching\nIn-depth\nFeatures\nNews\nArticles\nPeople on the move\nCampus Currents\nOpinion\nArticles\nSubmissions\nCareer Advice\nArticles\nSubscribe\nWays to subscribe\nPodcast\nRead the digital edition\nUniversity Affairs\nAbout us\nContact us\nAdvertise\nIssue archives\nJobs\nSearch Jobs\nUA Footer Symbol\nUniversity Affairs\nUniversity Affairs\nFacebook\nYoutube\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nAccessibility\nCopyright\nUniversity Affairs Privacy Notice\n© Universities Affairs 2025.

Abdulkarim Elnaas gets the best of both worlds.\nMr. Elnaas is in his first year of medical school at Memorial University where he uses his art skills to create detailed illustrations of the human anatomy and medical procedures that help him and his classmates study.\n“When I dive into stuff, like for example med school, I can be a little bit obsessive about what I dive into. So I thought ‘let’s try to combine my obsession with something that I’m good at.’”\nHe said he’s been interested in art from a very young age, starting with drawings of dinosaurs before moving on to fantasy drawings, inspired by Karl Kopinski and other artists of the tabletop game Warhammer 40,000. His interest in medical school developed after being treated for Hodgkin Lymphoma.\n“I definitely now feel like I’m in the right spot,” he said. “I had to kind of be on the other side of it to really see the value of it.”\nHis medical portfolio totals four drawings; two of a heart, one of a procedure and another of an animal bone. Mr. Elnaas said he wants to grow the portfolio, but it can be a long process.\n“I have like the sloppiest process you’ve ever seen,” he admitted with a smile. “I’m almost putting four or five drawings worth of work into one drawing.”\nHis classmates have enjoyed the art as well. Mr. Elnaas said fellow student Arista Marthyman is one of his biggest sources of encouragement – getting him to share his work publicly.\nMs. Marthyman said Mr. Elnaas posted one of his heart drawings on Facebook as the class was in their anatomy unit, saying he hoped it would be useful for study, “and sure enough it was.” She said that it’s helpful to see how others artistically interpret the things they’re studying.\n“He could draw a very exhaustive anatomy primer for all of us, which would be excellent.”\nShe also said the art he makes helps to humanize medicine. “It’s interesting, it’s not super common to see illustrations of medical procedures done in a way that is not just looking at the steps.”\nMr. Elnaas said that while art as a career isn’t something he sees in his future, instead focusing on emergency medicine, he may put his skills to use in his medical degree research project.\n“I’m still in the early stages of that, but definitely whatever I decide to settle on for my research project, I’d like to put a lot of illustrations into the paper, because I feel like that’s kind of an edge I have.”\nColson Swinarchin\nTags\nArt\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

This year’s theme was “Be Bold,” with more than 500 women nominated.\nAmong this year’s winners are five scholars from the University of Manitoba, including Hope Anderson.\n“I like to think that a powerful woman is one who has the wherewithal to bring out the best in those she leads, mentors, and serves,” Dr. Anderson said. “I feel so grateful to be named to the Top 100, but how exciting is that – the power of hundreds and hundreds of women in Canada. That warrants celebration.”\nHere’s a look at the five UM women who made the list:\nHope Anderson: Inspiring academic excellence\nDr. Anderson, vice-dean of graduate and postdoctoral studies at the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences and professor in the college of pharmacy, was listed in the professionals category, recognizing those who have a leadership role within their organization. She has more than 15 years of experience in academic governance and leads initiatives that empower graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and women in academia. She was named to the Top 100 list in the professionals category, recognizing those who have a leadership role within their organization.\nKristine Cowley: Advancing spinal cord research\nAs the Canada Research Chair in function and health after spinal cord injury (SCI), Dr. Cowley is a leader known for her research in SCI, biomedical neurosciences and knowledge translation. She sustained an SCI in her 20s, sparking her interest in understanding spinal cord functions. Dr. Crowley is an associate professor of physiology and pathophysiology at the Max Rady College of Medicine and the director of the Spinal Cord Research Centre for Health, Balance and Motor Control. She was honoured in the STEM category.\nMelanie Lalonde: Celebrating Indigenous knowledge\nDr. Lalonde’s extensive work in ecology and evolution has shaped her field, including discovering the grey buckeye butterfly. An honouree in the emerging leaders category, Dr. Lalonde is a program development specialist in the faculty of science’s Wawatay program, which supports Indigenous students in blending Indigenous perspectives with Western science. Dr. Lalonde, a Red River Métis Citizen, serves as the treasurer of Seven Oaks Métis Council and is a part of the Infinity Women Secretariat.\nLeigh Michelle McClarty: Breaking barriers to care\nDr. McClarty, an assistant professor at the Max Rady College of Medicine, was recognized in the emerging leaders category for her work reducing global health inequities. Her research focuses on improving public health programming for marginalized populations.\n“This [type of work] requires a collaborative, community-centric approach, and I am consistently inspired by my colleagues who graciously guide me through these processes,” Dr. McClarty says. “They help me better understand how to work toward safer, more equitable models of prevention and care that can adapt to the evolving needs and concerns of their communities.”\nHer research addresses barriers to care for communities affected by HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in Manitoba, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan and Ukraine. Dr. McClarty also serves as president of Nine Circles Community Health Centre in Winnipeg, advancing culturally safe care for individuals at risk of or living with sexually transmitted infections.\nNeeloffer Mookherjee: Empowering women in STEM\nRecognized in the STEM category, Dr. Mookherjee is an internationally recognized researcher in immunity-related functions and peptide-based therapeutics for chronic inflammatory diseases. She is the Canadian Institutes of Health Research sex and gender science chair in respiratory health and a professor of internal medicine and immunology at the Max Rady College of Medicine. Recognized in the STEM category, Dr. Mookherjee leads efforts to incorporate sex- and gender-based analyses into biomedical research, such as her work that looks at sex-specific impacts of air pollution on respiratory disease.\nKaitlin Vitt\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Instead, the University of Northern British Columbia professor of global international studies is developing a cyber self-defence toolkit to help women protect themselves while staying active online.\n“Digital rights is a very important form of gender equality,” said Dr. K C, who researches armed conflict, peace and security as they relate to women. Since social media and digital platform participation are important tools in career advancement, expecting women and girls to withdraw when they encounter online abuse “would really push them back.”\nFunded by a $50,000 grant from the federal department of national defence, which has been working to address gender-based violence within the military, Dr. K C hopes to launch the toolkit in summer 2025. It’s expected to outline risks of gender-based cyberviolence, provide evidence-based solutions, policy recommendations, practical strategies for responding to gender-based cyberviolence and resources for further ideas and support.\n“Is it possible to still protect women and girls’ rights without deleting their social media accounts?” said Dr. K C. “That is one of the major questions that I’m asking.”\nMoira MacDonald\nMoira MacDonald is a Toronto-based journalist.\nTags\nCybersecurity\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Unfortunately, cows out in an open field don’t have the same luxury, a problem that has potentially major impacts on their wellbeing. That’s why postdoctoral researcher Rachael Coon is studying the effectiveness of oilers – large barrels fixed with tassels – for keeping cattle fly-free.\nThe oilers – which the animals like to scratch and rub up against – stay out in the field and cows get a nice coating of insecticide by walking under the tassels, which have been saturated with a mineral oil that contains an insecticide. Next summer, Dr. Coon will lead a pilot project with the school of veterinary medicine’s W.A. Ranches, a working cow-calf ranch, about the use of oilers, a large barrel affixed with tassels coated in insecticide. “There is no research currently to tell us whether cattle are using the oiler because of the enrichments included, or if they’re using it because they’re aware of the potential benefits in terms of keeping flies off them, so that’s a part I’m interested in studying,” Dr. Coon said.\nOther methods for keeping flies at bay, like applying insecticide topically or using ear tags infused with it, can be burdensome for producers, said Dr. Coon. “I’m interested in both a health perspective, that looks at how to minimize the amount of pesticides we’re using, by monitoring fly populations, while also using a method that is not as labour- intensive for cattle producers.” Bites and irritation cause behaviour issues like avoidance and aggression, she explained, making it more challenging to care for cattle. Flies also contribute to the spread of diseases like pinkeye, which is estimated to cause about $150 million in annual economic loss in the American cattle industry. One theory is that when flies are abundant, cows tend to bunch up together, “and they’re transmitting [pinkeye] by contact,” Dr. Coon said.\nHer project will also track fly populations. By attaching a device used for monitoring fruit flies to the oiler, Dr. Coon will be able to capture real-time images of the pests. From there, she’ll use computer algorithms to monitor the types of flies, with the hope of creating a more informed approach to pesticide use.\n“One of the current recommendations [for pest control] is to avoid more than 200 flies per animal, which is quite a difficult task,” Dr. Coon said. “I’m interested in whether there are other ways we could be assessing fly numbers that don’t require the producer to be out on pasture, actually counting.” The device would also allow producers to monitor fly numbers in real time from their smartphones.\nIn terms of wider potential for this research, Dr. Coon said she hopes it can be adapted to environments where cattle are kept more densely, such as feedlots before slaughter. That’s where the idea for this project first came to her, when working with cattle in that setting during her PhD at the University of California, Davis. “It’s a very hot climate and in the summer the flies were overwhelming, and I could see that they were affecting the animal’s behaviour negatively,” she said. With this project, she’s looking forward to taking the results from a pasture-based setting and applying it to more “intensively managed systems.”\nOther pasture-based animals impacted by flies, like goats and sheep, could also be future candidates. “Ultimately the goal for me as an animal behavior specialist is to improve animal welfare,” Dr. Coon said.\nShauna McGinn\nTags\nAgriculture\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

It requires purposefully engaging in ways that unseat or disrupt axes of power. As a white cis-hetero male, this means reflectively and intentionally interrupting oppressive acts. Allyship means recognizing the layers of privilege and the multiple intersecting axis of power that (in)form our daily interactions. The means by which we are and can be allies reflects our abilities and willingness to disrupt and engage with institutionalized inequities. In short, allyship means recognizing systemic injustices and challenging the silences that cloak racism, sexism, misogyny, as normal. Allyship is about finding that voice, elevating that voice and promoting voice that dismantles systemic injustices.\nWhat actions can men take to advance gender equality in academia?\nMen can pay attention to how and if they are listening and respecting the voices of others. Male allies can ask themselves what and how exactly are they supportive in situations that require allyship. In other words, when men see gender inequities, they need to consider active, supportive disruption. Male allies need to consider how we invite others, particularly other men, to support an open dialogue that makes gender inequities visible. Men can nurture and promote dialogue and curiosity rather than sustain misogyny or allow for male defensiveness and silence. Frank and uncomfortable conversations that make explicit power imbalances or perceived unfair power are difficult but necessary. In academia this means that male allies can interrupt sexism and misogyny and institutional practices that implicitly and explicitly silence or serve to gloss over injustices.\nHow should male allies react when they see gender bias, discrimination or harrassment?\nComplicit masculinity, unlike allyship, reflects the silences, the awareness of various forms of whisper cultures in which racism, sexism, misogyny go unquestioned and unacknowledged. To bear witness to gender bias, discrimination or harassment means male allies must react with compassion and awareness. Male allies are uniquely positioned to dislodge themselves from male privileges by disrupting and questioning male counterparts whose practices, interactions, attitudes are discriminatory. In short, men should speak up when they hear or see evidence of sexism, harassment, misogyny or racism. The courage to speak alongside and not for women signals action and the required interrogation by allies.\nHow can administrations promote effective ways to engage male allies in allyship?\nHistorically administrations have not developed strategies to promote or encourage allyship. Acknowledging attitudes, behaviours, and the impacts of normative masculinity can lead to broader conversations that identify institutional sexism, harassment and racism in academia. Issues including, for example, mental health and gender-based violence are concerns for all of us. The ways masculinity manifests itself on campus, in academia, and in daily interactions at universities is a way to promote male allyship while acknowledging diverse masculinities. By supporting a plurality of masculinities, administration will legitimize boys and men being unlike the rest who are routinely complicit in sustaining and guarding the normalcy and membership of the boys’ club. Until administration purposefully disrupts, challenges, and interrogates masculinity on campus, the boys’ club and complicit masculinity will continue propping up systemic sexism, racism, homophobia and harassment.\nUA Staff\nTags\nGender equity\nInternational Women's Day\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Joined by others from the Aurelia Institute’s Horizons Program (a collaboration with MIT’s Media Lab) she experienced a range of gravity-free conditions including microgravity, lunar gravity, Mars gravity and hypergravity.\nMs. Luitel was there to test her zero-gravity project – an innovative garment reflecting her Nepalese background – created with designer Deborah Won for life in space. The outfit features red rhododendrons, Nepal’s national flower, which appear to bloom from the black garment in the weightless environment.\n“I’ve always had a goal to do a zero-gravity flight,” said Ms. Luitel, who immigrated to Fredericton from Nepal with her family in 2017. “Growing up, I often wondered — how are people not completely obsessed with space?” Her family’s move to Canada opened her eyes to a world of opportunities. She initially studied mechanical engineering, eventually switching to computer science and then to culture and media studies.\nDuring that time, she and two other engineering students sent a painting to the Earth’s stratosphere aboard a high-altitude weather balloon.\nBut she didn’t see her future in engineering. “I just slowly started seeing what my life would look like if I continued on this path,” she said. As her academic focus evolved, so did her vision for what she wanted to achieve in the aerospace field.\n“I felt like I could find an intersection within this field where it could fulfill all of my desires.”\nIn January 2024, she enrolled in an online course called SpaceKind, which is “a leadership course about the future of humanity and the democratization of space,” she said. She met Ms. Won, who designs weightless space fashion through her startup, Pisces Rising, and the zero-gravity project was conceived.\n“She has a drive and a sort of focused-ness to her ambition that I think is really strong and perhaps unique for someone so young,” said Lauren Cruikshank, an associate professor in UNB’s department of culture and media studies, who also worked one-on-one with Ms. Luitel. “Her project is a really interesting bringing together of art, science, media and a personal cultural story,” said Dr. Cruikshank, “as well as the idea of how cultural belonging can play a helpful role in keeping astronauts from feeling isolated and disconnected when they’re in space.”\n“I realized how space can be used as a tool for expression,” said Ms. Luitel. “It can be used as a tool for impact. It can be used as a tool to make other people’s lives better … and create an exciting future for all of us to look forward to.”\nAngela Mombourquette\nAngela Mombourquette is an award-winning freelance writer and editor based in Halifax, NS.\nTags\nFashion\nInterdisciplinary project\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

It is set to be reopened on the university’s 100th anniversary in 2064.\nThe working group for the time capsule project has opened an online form to field suggestions for items to include which Bradley Clarke, associate vice-president of students, and chair of Brock’s 60th anniversary steering committee, said will remain open until March 14. Items must meet the following criteria:\nReflective of Brock’s 60th anniversary period from 2024-25\nHighlights one or many present-day aspects of the Brock experience\nFits within the time capsule dimensions — 47” x 39.2” x 15.5” — while allowing a reasonable amount of space for other items\nCan be enjoyed without the use of technology\nLikely to be preserved for 40 years\n“One suggestion that came out is an example of what’s in the typical student’s backpack these days,” said David Sharron, head of archives and special collections at Brock. “An image of what students carry around today, because I’m sure it’s going to be dramatically different in the future.”\n“The thing is nowadays everything is digital … Years from now, there might not be a player for that media because technology changes so fast. So, we really have to move more towards analog [and] physical documents rather than digital.”\nThe working group responsible for the time capsule project has set a collection deadline of June 13 for all items to be included in the project.\nNot the first\nThis is the third time capsule Brock has created, with one in 2004 for their 40th anniversary and one in 2016 to celebrate renovations done to the Goodman School of Business. Mr. Clarke, himself, has been at Brock to witness all three.\n“I have a special history at Brock. My first year, as an incoming student, was in 1994, which was actually our 30th anniversary. I came back as a staff member in 2003 and so was able to be part of the 40th anniversary of the university – of course, the 50th was a major milestone, now the 60th.”\nThe 40th anniversary time capsule, Mr. Clarke said, is displayed on campus between the student centre and the Plaza Building, set to be reopened on the university’s 80th anniversary in 2044.\nWhile there is no plan set in stone, Mr. Clarke said this time capsule will likely be put on display in the student centre when renovations are complete in 2027.
