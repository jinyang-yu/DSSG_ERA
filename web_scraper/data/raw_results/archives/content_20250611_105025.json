But in today’s universities, an increasing number of scholars find themselves trapped in precarious, low-paid sessional contracts – far from the secure careers they once envisioned.\nIn this episode of The Academic Issue, Dr. Jamie Paris joins Kate to discuss the systemic issues behind unstable employment in academia, drawing from his article The Exploitation Trap of Hope Labour. We explore the emotional and financial toll of “hope labour” and why universities continue to rely on precarious workers – but is real change possible?\nShow more\nShow less\nEpisode 2\nAI and Academia\nGuest\nMark Daley\nListening options:\nListen on Spotify\nListen on Apple Podcasts\nListen on Amazon Music\nListen on iHeart Podcasts\nListen on Podchaser\nListen on Podbean\nGenerative AI tools like Chat GPT have already sent shockwaves through the academic world, raising complex questions about academic integrity and the nature of learning.

Since President Donald Trump’s election in November 2024, they had been duplicating government web pages, interactive tools and datasets in case the new administration decided to change, delete or irretrievably conceal them.\nBy the end of January, about 2,000 pages had gone missing from the total inventory of about 310,000 pages on U.S. federal government websites. “That’s 2,000 missed opportunities; 2,000 things that people won’t find there anymore,” says Eric Nost, associate professor of geography, environment and geomatics at the University of Guelph.\nThen, in a January 20 order, the U.S. government directed all federal agencies to acknowledge only two biological sexes and to “remove all … internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.” Information such as the results of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey were taken down — although that particular page was later restored after a court order, with a disclaimer stating that the administration rejects its contents.\nIt’s normal for government digital materials to change as they are revised or become redundant. When new governments come in, more rewrites and deletions happen, often reflecting the agenda of the administration. “The surprising thing here has been the scope and speed of these changes,” says Dr. Nost.\nDr. Nost works with the U.S.-based Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI), a group formed in 2016 during the first Trump administration whose mission includes safeguarding vulnerable environmental data. “We saw fairly significant efforts to change website language and the way issues such as climate change and energy were described,” Dr. Nost says of President Trump’s first term, adding that datasets were largely left untouched at that time. “This time around, the scope of changes is much wider.”\nRecently, Dr. Nost has been duplicating interactive tools used to access datasets, including the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, which was taken down on January 22. He helped recreate the interactive map and repost it on the site of a climate group.\nWhile Dr. Nost is Canadian and the data is American, it’s hugely important to him and to his colleagues. “The U.S. federal government is the world’s largest publisher of information,” he says. Kristi Thompson, research data management librarian at Western University, noted, “People go to their data because they have great, detailed data sets. A lot of Canadian research and worldwide research is based on those sets.”\nConcerns in Canada\nMs. Thompson is part of group of about 50 people with the newly hatched Canadian Data Rescue Project, which is backing up minor government department sites. “There is a clear assault on public data and public knowledge going on in the United States,” she says. “If you destroy the trust in public data collection, that’s significant. And I’m concerned the same thing could happen in Canada.”\nPrior to the Canadian federal election in April 2025, Katie Cuyler, open publishing and government information librarian at the University of Alberta, was doing her part to safeguard information as part of the End of Session Archive conducted by Internet Archive Canada. “The vibe is chaotic and uncertain,” she said of that time.\nEstablished in 2004, Internet Archives Canada is affiliated with California-based Internet Archive, which digitizes books and preserves old versions of websites on its Wayback Machine. One of the first digital preservation initiatives, the Internet Archive dates to 1996, when the Internet itself was growing and becoming increasingly accessible. Like newspapers, the content published on the web was ephemeral — but unlike newspapers, no one was saving it.\nMore groups and projects started in 2008, with elections on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border in a digital era. Libraries, which used to keep paper copies of government documents, had begun making virtual backups. In the U.S. the End of Term Web Archive launched, while Internet Archive Canada began backing up government data.\nIn 2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Conservative government abolished the long-form census. In 2012, it defunded of the First Nations Statistical Institute and closed a slew of federal government libraries. In response, a group of committed library professionals launched the Canadian Government Information Digital Preservation Network (CGI-DPN). “What happened in 2012 really lit a fire,” says Ms. Cuyler.\nFinding better ways to save\nThere are a dizzying number of groups and projects tackling the preservation of vast amounts of tough-to-track information. “What’s freaky about datasets is when they’re gone, they’re just gone. You’re relying on other things to know they even existed,” says Ms. Thompson.\nNow, those doing this work are seeking to improve their protocols. “While the data does not go away, it becomes harder to access,” says Matt Price, assistant professor of history at the University of Toronto, who works with EDGI. “We’ve had initiatives to back up dataset but nobody ever used the data. It was like we took the family inheritance and put it into big glass jars and buried it in the backyard.”\nThere’s a push to establish common repositories and to ensure that academics, librarians, students and the public know where to find them. The Wayback Machine is well-known, and librarians are promoting the repository Borealis, a partnership of numerous university libraries hosted at U of T, which contains materials such as agricultural and environmental datasets.\nAs well, saved information needs care over time, says Andrea Mills, executive director, Internet Archive Canada. “Some of the government documents that we have digitized are almost 20 years. We have to go back and do the optical character recognition over again, improving formats and leveraging new technology.”\nBig tech risks\nDr. Price struggles with storing materials on cloud platforms run by tech giants such as Google and Amazon Web Services, some of which offer in-kind donations to U.S. data-backup groups. According to CNN, Amazon and Google each donated $1 million to President Trump’s inaugural fund. “I think we should be careful. We should recognize that we are entrusting important work to untrustworthy actors,” Dr. Price says.\nIn a perfect world, Canada would collect more of its own data, and the safety of evidence-based materials would be carefully protected here and elsewhere. For now, there’s backing up, coding, collaborating and hoping for the best. “This is a stressful time,” says Ms. Cuyler, “and a reminder that democracy takes a lot of work.”\nDiane Peters\nDiane Peters is a Toronto-based writer and editor.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

It propelled the career of neuroscientist Donna Rose Addis, leading her to win the 2010 Prime Minister’s MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize in her home country of New Zealand.\nDr. Addis currently leads the Memory Lab at the Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest, which is affiliated with the University of Toronto (U of T). There, a team of researchers is studying memory, identity and — of particular importance for Canada’s senescent population — the aging brain. She is one of the two dozen renowned scholars supported by the Canada 150 Research Chairs Program.\nLaunched eight years ago to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Confederation, the program provided a one-time investment of $117.6 million to Canadian universities to attract top-tier, internationally based scholars.\nDonna Rose Addis, C150 Research Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience of Memory and Aging. © Rachel Wong, Baycrest\nTwenty of the C150 Research Chairs are still active, engaged in research in the social sciences and humanities; natural sciences and engineering; and health and life sciences. However, the program is sunsetting this year — at a dramatic time for Canada and the world.\nTo rank the accomplishments of the chairs would be a monumental task, and for Ted Hewitt, president of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), beside the point.  “The aim was to attract people who were leading edge in their field, no matter where they happen to be, to come to Canada and create research hubs or centres,” he said.\nThe lab of Alàn Aspuru-Guzik, a C150 Research Chair in Theoretical Chemistry, provides a compelling example of such a research hub. A pioneer in the use of AI for chemical and materials applications, Dr. Aspuru-Guzik has brought in more than $20 million and grown his lab to include more than 40 highly qualified personnel since. “It’s not that I recruited them — they came, because it’s a movement,” said Dr. Aspuru-Guzik, who also holds a CIFAR AI Chair at the Vector Institute at U of T, one of Canada’s three AI institutes. “We want to make Canada, but also Toronto in particular, the leader in AI for materials.”\nFormerly at Harvard University, Dr. Aspuru-Guzik said choosing Canada made sense, not only for his research ambitions but because he was worried about the societal impacts when Donald Trump was first elected U.S. president in 2016. “I believe in democracy and justice, and when Trump gets elected — and I am Jewish, Mexican — I get really worried about how Trump is going to behave.”\nDr. Aspuru-Guzik is one of many scholars who accepted a C150 Research Chair in part because of the global geopolitical climate at the time the program debuted. Several others, such as Jennifer Welsh, an international affairs expert, were motivated by the shocking announcement that the United Kingdom was leaving the European Union after the 2016 Brexit referendum.  A renowned political scientist who served as special adviser to former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Dr. Welsh joined McGill University as the Canada 150 Research Chair in Global Governance and Society as it was preparing to launch the Max Bell School of Public Policy. “The chance to be part of building up something new at McGill was really interesting to me,” she said.\nJennifer Welsh, Canada 150 Research Chair in Global Governance and Society. © Owen Egan and Joni Dufour\nNow, having taken over as the school’s director, Dr. Welsh is passionate about teaching students how policy development interacts with partisan politics, and as with many of the C150 Research Chairs, is impressed with the calibre of Canadian students, from undergraduates to postdoctoral fellows. “There’s a great foundation, and now it’s about taking it to the next level […] I want to make it much more global in its orientation, both in terms of teaching and policy impact.”\nThis is a critical time for Canada to have a convening space for important policy discussions, Dr. Welsh says. The global context — much as in 2016 — is evolving rapidly, and existing institutions are struggling to adapt to sweeping global changes, including armed conflicts, mass migration, climate change and rising populism.\nComplicating that global reality is the growth of misinformation and disinformation online — with social media often becoming a breeding-ground for abusive language, discriminatory algorithms and ideological echo chambers. Seeking to mitigate those harms, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Canada 150 Research Chair in New Media at Simon Fraser University, is applying data science to understand how digital media are created and consumed.\nAfter returning to Canada from the U.S. in 2018, Dr. Chun founded the Digital Democracies Institute (DDI). The team she leads comprises 20 faculty members, two postdocs and more than a dozen graduate and undergraduate students from across the humanities, social sciences and computer and information sciences.\nWendy Hui Kyong Chun, Canada 150 Research Chair in New Media. © Simon Fraser University\n“The people who typically wouldn’t speak to each other are now working together to create innovative strategies to take on the hard issues facing the online world,” she said. The DDI’s research focuses on the spread of mis/disinformation, fostering democratic exchange online, data discrimination and the causes of echo chambers, among other issues.\nBeyond her work with the DDI, Dr. Chun works to promote Canada as a global centre for media research. She has contributed policy recommendations to the Canadian Commission on Democratic Expression and the United Nations High Panel on Internet Governance.\n“We’re helping to create the next generation. We’re giving our students tools and resources not previously available in Canada, so they can take on these important issues — and become world leaders in this work,” said Dr. Chun.\n‘Time to triple research funding’\nThe new Canadian government under Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney is promising to massively reform the Canadian economy in the face of a global trade war waged by President Trump’s second administration. The American university system is also under attack, with research funding gutted in critical areas such as climate science, and academic freedom at its most vulnerable.\nMany in the Canadian university sector believe that the turmoil south of the border presents an opportunity for Canada to again attract some of the best researchers from the U.S. and around the world. For the SSHRC’s Dr. Hewitt, recruiting the best people to keep Canada competitive in a rapidly advancing research landscape is “fundamentally a question of sovereignty.”\n“We have to look after ourselves – but we work in a global system and need to make sure borders remain open and fluid,” he said. “And as they do, we’ll make sure to make the best use of the talent that we have in Canada, attract the talent we’re able to from the outside and build the country that we all want.”\nAlàn Aspuru-Guzik, C150 Research Chair in Theoretical Chemistry. © Polina Teif\nThe new federal government promised to invest $100 million to bring researchers to Canada — particularly those whose funding has been cut in the U.S. In 2024, the previous Liberal government announced, not coincidentally in the lab of Dr. Aspuru-Guzik, $1.8 billion in federal research funding over five years. However, to date, only a fraction of that has been spent.\nThis year, Dr. Aspuru-Guzik will lose the funding provided by both of his chairs, which end in 2025, as well as investments from the U.S. He predicts his lab could be cut from 40 people to 10 by 2026. “I will do my best science I can with 10 people — but I think that’s the reality of what’s coming, and that’s a problem we have to face,” he said.\n“My message to [Prime Minister] Carney — and please quote me — is this is the moment to triple the funding for research in Canada.”\nThese four C150 Research Chairs are among the majority who intend to stay in Canada and, ideally, expand their research hubs even after the program ends. Since 2017, the chairs and their core team members have received more than 1,300 awards and trained nearly 1,000 undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.\nIn the Memory Lab, Dr. Addis foresees many more collaborations with Canadian researchers and institutions. She says she plans to apply for Canadian citizenship as soon as possible and make Canada her permanent home. “I really feel like I have found my people.”\nShe wants to advance her research by investigating how the power of our imaginations could help shift decision-making for better collective outcomes. What the C150 Research Chairs Program has made clear is that investments in Canada’s research capacity can bring positive outcomes for Canadians — at a time when we are dreaming big about our own future.\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nTags\nInnovation\nInnovation Week\nresearch\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Though such deep-fried fodder remains available, healthier options are becoming more widespread. As scientific studies highlight the harmful health effects of ultra-processed foods, awareness is growing about the benefits of a diet rich in vegetables, plant-based proteins, white meat, fish and whole grains. Young people are increasingly choosing to eat fewer animal products or to cut them out altogether, guided by their cultural or religious beliefs or their concern about the carbon footprint of raising animals for food. Students who crave a bowl of brown rice with grilled tofu and mixed vegetables, topped with green-onion-and-ginger sauce, might now be able to find it at a select Canadian university.\nEleven years ago, the Vancouver campus of the University of British Columbia (UBC) launched a food revolution. Campus food services developed a new vision of using fresh ingredients to provide healthy, delicious, inspiring, socially responsible and environmentally conscious meals. Ultra-processed foods zapped in the microwave were replaced with fresh meals made on site.\n“We had to hire a culinary team and a number of chefs to lead this revolution,” notes David Speight, executive chef and culinary director at UBC Vancouver.\nA full-time dietitian collaborated with the chefs to establish guidelines inspired by the university’s institutional values, Canada’s Food Guide and  Menus of Change (an initiative of the Culinary Institute of America and Harvard University).\nAt UBC, a typical plate consists of half fruits and/or vegetables, one-quarter protein, and one-quarter whole grains or high-fibre carbohydrates. Unsweetened milk, yogurt, and fortified plant-based beverages are available. Each service location offers daily vegetarian and vegan options.\nDietitians drive change\nOther institutions are following suit. Ontario’s University of Guelph (U of Guelph) has kept a dietitian on staff for the last two years. After participating in several training programs, its food services team now offers a menu featuring 50 per cent plant-based proteins.\nPhoto Courtesy of: University of British-Columbia\n“We have nearly 50 chefs and cooks from 12 ethnic backgrounds who infuse a tremendous amount of taste and flavour into our plant-based protein dishes,” says Vijay Nair, assistant director of culinary operations at U of Guelph. Nutrition students also promote healthy eating habits by offering nutrition education and peer support through the Student Nutrition Awareness Program (SNAP).\nIn Ottawa, Carleton University’s dietitian helps plan menus and holds free consultations for any student on a meal plan. The cafeteria has 15 stations offering a variety of options. The EatWell logo helps students identify healthy choices.\n“We are the main source of food for our 4,000 or so residents,” reasons Chad McKenzie, director of campus services at Carleton. “So it’s important to offer nutritious options.”\nWhat concrete contributions do dietitians make to university food services? “We can calculate the nutritional value of each meal,” explains Carol-Ann Robert, nutritionist-dietitian with Team Nutrition. “If it’s low in fibre, for example, we can recommend adding a vegetable to the recipe or changing out one ingredient for another. We also make sure that the menu is varied.”\nA transformation underway\nAlthough most Canadian university food services do not yet have a dietitian on staff, and many still offer a preponderance of fried foods and sandwiches on white bread, several institutions have begun transitioning to healthier options.\nUniversité de Moncton, for example, offers vegetarian fare, sourcing its vegetables from a local producer. “Many of our students come from Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Senegal,” notes Marc Surette, food services manager at Université de Moncton. “These are countries where people eat a lot of chickpeas and lentils, so we serve those on our menus.”\nEight years ago, Université de Montréal (UdeM), launched an initiative to offer a wider variety of dishes. Its menu includes vegetarian and vegan cuisine, and fish is served up once a week. It also prioritizes local sourcing — for example, buying Arctic char raised in a Montreal-based intensive water recirculation system.\n“Local sourcing is more expensive,” notes UdeM spokesperson Geneviève O’Meara, “but, on the flip side, plant-based proteins are not very expensive.”\nThe University of Saskatchewan is also bringing about change. “We now provide several plant-based options and want to offer even more,” says James McFarland, culinary services assistant director and executive chef. “We also occasionally have food like burgers on the menu, but we’re trying to educate students by providing nutritious alternatives, like our healthy bowls.”\nSetting an example\nMs. Robert feels that university food services can do more than just nourish: they can also provide an education. “The idea is not to strive for perfection, but to create an environment that encourages better habits,” she says.\nShe notes that some foods should be eaten daily, others occasionally, and others only rarely. In her view, a university should reflect this idea: “We don’t want to ban guilty pleasures, we just want to make healthier choices the norm.”\nMartine Letarte\nTags\ncampus\nfood\nhealth\nhealthy food\nnutrition\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

While touching on many topics, including the economy, defense, trade, Indigenous rights, protection of nature, border controls, gun laws and international relations, the speech had little to say regarding higher education. However, in the context of creating a new industrial strategy, the Throne Speech promised “to build hundreds of thousands of good careers in the trades and … make Canada a science and innovation hub.”\nThe speech outlined the government’s plan to ease the housing crisis by incentivizing a made-in-Canada modular housing industry and by giving tax breaks to first-time home buyers. Although it did not speak explicitly of alleviating costs for renters, many of whom are students, it did promise to cut municipal development charges for new multi-unit housing, which could potentially lower rents.\nLast week, Carney released his first official mandate letter to Cabinet, outlining a list of seven priorities. Although higher education was not mentioned explicitly, the goal of “attracting the best talent in the world to help build our economy, while returning overall immigration rates to sustainable levels” was named as the sixth priority.\nAccording to Statistics Canada, there are currently about 1.5 million temporary foreign workers and 944,000 international students (some of whom also hold work permits) in Canada. When family members are factored in, the total number of people residing in the country on work and study permits amounts to just over 2.5 million, or approximately 6.2 per cent of the total population.\nDuring the recent election campaign, Carney said that caps on international study permits imposed by the previous Liberal government would remain unchanged. The Carney government plans to issue 437,000 new study permits and extensions in 2025, down from 485,000 in 2024.\nOn the campaign trail, the Liberals also proposed a plan that would allocate $2 billion (in partnership with provinces) to develop new student housing. They also promised to invest $100 million in the Canadian Sovereignty and Resilience Fund to attract professors and graduate students whose funding is being cut in the United States.\nThis is the first time since 1977 that the reigning monarch has read the Speech from the Throne. Generally, the Governor General reads the speech as the representative of the Crown. King Charles’s visit is widely seen as a symbolic rebuke of U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to annex Canada to the United States and as an assertion of Canada’s existence as a distinct sovereign nation.\nHailey Leggett\nHailey is a University Affairs intern.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Photo by Kate Jaimet\n0 Comments\nLast month, the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences (FHSS) — a pan-Canadian organization representing dozens of scholarly associations — announced that it will be unable to  hold its 2026 Congress after an unnamed institution backed out of months-long negotiations to host the event.\nIt is, instead, offering a virtual conference next year, with a “smaller-scale, in person event at a yet-to-be-determined location,” according to an announcement issued by FHSS president and CEO Karine Morin.\nCongress — whose June 2025 edition included some 7,000 faculty, graduate students and community members at Toronto’s George Brown College — is Canada’s largest academic gathering. The event has been a mainstay of Canadian humanities and social science research for nearly a century. The cancellation of the in-person event for 2026 has sent research groups into a scramble to arrange alternatives that will be smaller, less well-funded, and that will garner less attention from host venues and the public.\nThe road has been rocky for Congress since the COVID-19 pandemic, when the conference was cancelled in 2020 and moved online for 2021 and 2022.\nLast year, when Congress was to be held at McGill University in Montreal, dozens of scholarly associations cancelled their participation in the conference or made last-minute moves to alternative sites amidst an active strike by McGill professors in the Faculty of Law and a protest encampment in the field that would have hosted the Federation’s beer tent. Many research groups — my own included — found it untenable to ask delegates to gather behind picket lines in a business-as-usual manner, mere days after students had been tear-gassed on their own campus.\nWith a year to go before the next scheduled Congress in June 2026, some readers might wonder why the FHSS doesn’t simply find a new host. But the Federation has stated that alternatives have been considered, and ruled out, because of the logistics involved in mounting an event that can gather upwards of 10,000 people. For five years I ran the largest conference within Congress for the Canadian Society for the Study of Education, so I know first-hand how complex those logistical layers can be.\nHosting large scholarly gatherings has become something like the Olympics: expensive, politically fraught and an endeavour that few institutions are rushing to undertake amidst widespread austerity measures and mounting budget challenges.\nThere are alternatives to hosting conferences like Congress at universities — many comparable events in the United States are hosted at hotels and convention centers — but such venues almost always cost much more than academic spaces and come with their own suite of problems.\nSome of my colleagues have suggested that individual scholarly associations go their own way. They point to the Federation’s repeated crises as evidence that a century-old model of mega-conferencing doesn’t meet their members’ needs. They have a point: cost, accessibility and scholarly representation are serious issues that deserve attention.\nBut the death of in-person scholarly gatherings like Congress would be a real loss for Canadian research. Such gatherings create space (often imperfectly) for graduate students, early-career scholars and seasoned faculty to come together, share their research and build collaborative networks across universities, provinces and scholarly disciplines. Such conferences are one of the most reliable ways to meet with colleagues from far-flung institutions who don’t often travel to smaller research centers like my own city of Winnipeg.\nThe Federation in particular serves as an advocate for research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and dedicates significant funding to support research excellence and advance equity, diversity, inclusion and decolonization goals. Its logistical work hosting Congress each year enables many small, volunteer-run associations to focus on research instead of fiddling with administrative minutiae.\nCanadian research institutions face immense pressure, while internationally research in the humanities and social sciences is being directly threatened. Amidst this turbulence, Canadian academics need robust scholarly spaces to gather and strengthen the role of research in society. Scattering those spaces to the wind and duplicating organizing efforts does nothing to strengthen Canadian research.\nThe Federation is not a perfect organization. Its Congress has faced many challenges over the past seven years, for which it has been rightly criticized. But amidst those criticisms and the challenges facing Canadian researchers, we need universities to step up, prove that they value humanities and social sciences research, and continue to create spaces for that work to occur.\nCongress isn’t just an event, it’s a community. Creating strong research communities takes ongoing work, which means Congress needs champions willing to do that work — together.\nMichael Holden\nMichael Holden, PhD, is an assistant professor in the Faculty of Education at the University of Winnipeg.\nTags\nCongress\nFHSS\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

In 2018, 58 per cent of students at Quebec universities reported experiencing high levels of psychological distress, while in 2022, 67 per cent of students in Ontario reported a deterioration of their mental health.\nSupport measures often target individuals rather than their environment. Yet, the conceptual model for mental health surveillance developed in 2023 by the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (National public health institute of Quebec—INSPQ) illustrates that numerous environmental factors can also affect mental health.\nThe international Okanagan Charter (2015) invites universities and colleges to become health-promoting institutions. It emphasizes creating healthy living environments and reminds institutions of their responsibility to support this endeavour.\nHow can postsecondary institutions promote healthy environments?\nWe recently conducted a comprehensive review of environmental factors affecting the mental health of postsecondary students. We identified three broad categories:\nHousing environment\nSocial environment\nBuilt environment\nThe vital role of housing\nHousing is a fundamental determinant of good mental health and academic success. It is especially important in the context of the current housing crisis. The “housing environment” category includes the social and built characteristics of student dwellings. High-quality housing and access to indoor or outdoor greenery generally contribute to better mental health. Conversely, living in a small space (less than 60 m2) is associated with a greater risk of symptoms of mental distress.\nSocial environments: powerful yet invisible\nThe “social environment” category encompasses the various aspects of collective life, such as social capital and social cohesion. Having a large network and good supports, feeling connected and integrated into the learning environment, and living in a setting that prioritizes well-being and connection are all factors associated with better mental health. By contrast, the social environment in postsecondary institutions can also encourage student alcohol and drug use by normalizing or rewarding these behaviours. Discrimination or violence are associated with a higher risk of symptoms of mental distress and decreased mental health.\nBuilt environment: a boon to mental health — and the planet\nThe “built environment” category relates to natural and human-made features and amenities, such as urban design, green areas and public spaces. In general, exposure to nature and greenery is associated with better mental health. Quieter neighbourhoods with little traffic or pollution promote mental wellness, as does a walkable or bikeable environment. A high-quality campus setting, both indoors and outdoors, is also beneficial; for example, green spaces mitigate heat islands while beautifying the academic surroundings.\nHow can postsecondary institutions create environments that promote mental health?\nThe Okanagan Charter includes two calls to action. We’ve added our thoughts to these, informed by our comprehensive review:\nIntegrate health into all aspects of campus culture.\nPostsecondary institutions must create policies prioritizing inclusion and health. These policies enable the creation of social environments that promote connection and safety. To achieve this, institutions must understand how an environment can be experienced differently by different people. It is essential to take into account the different perspectives and needs of a diverse student body.\nUndertake actions and partnerships that promote health, both locally and globally.\nEducational institutions must identify collaborative opportunities to shape student environments on multiple levels. It’s important to decide which locations to prioritize, both on and off campus, and to identify the most influential players in each of these settings.\nTo learn more:\nStation SME offers information and tools to support educational institutions in creating learning environments that promote student mental health by addressing related environmental factors. A reflexive tool is available to guide institutions in this exercise.\nThis article is part of a monthly series on student mental health in higher education by the Observatoire sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur (Observatory on Student Mental Health in Higher Education—OSMÉES) and the Initiative sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur (Initiative for student mental health in higher education—ISMÉ).\nJustine Pineault, François Lauzier-Jobin & Martine Shareck\nJustine Pineault is a doctoral candidate in community health at Université de Sherbrooke and contributes to OSMÉES’s T1 pillar on healthy environments.\nFrançois Lauzier-Jobin is a social worker, assistant professor at Université de Sherbrooke’s nursing department, and head of OSMÉES’s T13 pillar on expanding mental health services.\nMartine Shareck is an associate professor of community health at Université de Sherbrooke and Tier 2 Canada Research Chair on Urban Health Equity and Young People (2020–2026). She also heads OSMÉES’s T1 pillar on healthy environments.\nTags\nOSMEES\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Op-eds emerge, declaring either the death of Canadianization or its survival, sprinkled with anecdotes from a few departments. Meanwhile, those of us who have spent years looking into professors’ CVs have been watching this predictable cycle for decades.\nThe latest round in University Affairs features Ari Gandsman‘s warning of systematic Americanization squeezing out Canadian talent, while Dominik Stecuła sees Trump’s academic crackdown as Canada’s opportunity to attract displaced American scholars. Both bring compelling anecdotes, but they’re missing key parts of the story.\nWhat is unfolding is more complicated and nuanced: While both authors treat current pro-American hiring patterns as deviations from an imagined Canada-centric norm, such a norm existed only briefly — if at all — at many of Canada’s leading research universities. In the social sciences, especially, faculty hiring reflects a clear transition in influence: from British-trained scholars in the first half of the 20th century to a dominant reliance on U.S.-trained faculty after the Second World War.\nThe Canadianization movement of the 1970s and early 1980s sought to alter that trend, leading to formal policies in 1981 that required preference for Canadian citizens and landed immigrants in all aspects of academic hiring. But for the only three Canadian institutions ranked among the top 50 in the 2025 QS World University Rankings — McGill, the University of Toronto (U of T) and the University of British Columbia (UBC) — Canadianization turned out to be just a historical anomaly. Since the late 1980s, a great divergence at the institutional level has created two distinct spheres within Canadian English-speaking research universities, moving in different, often competing, directions regarding the doctoral origins of the scholars they hire.\nIn 2018, this article’s co-author Francois Lachapelle and sociologist Patrick John Burnett published the award-winning study “Replacing the Canadianization Generation: An Examination of Faculty Composition from 1977 through 2017” in the Canadian Review of Sociology. The Relational-Academia dataset tracked 4,935 faculty across five social science disciplines (anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology) at Canada’s U15 universities over four decades, with comprehensive PhD data.\nThe analysis of hiring patterns at McGill, U of T, and UBC — let’s call them “the triad”— reveals the stark reality. Between 1977 and 2017, these institutions drew 65 per cent of their social sciences faculty from U.S. universities and just 22 per cent from Canadian institutions. Of that modest Canadian share, 62 per cent represent cases of the triad trading PhDs among themselves or hiring their own graduates. This leaves a mere eight per cent of faculty positions at these three universities going to PhDs from all other Canadian institutions over four decades.\nPhD placement patterns at McGill, U of T and UBC, 1977-2017\nThis diagram maps the aggregate hiring patterns of U of T, McGill, and UBC’s Vancouver campus between 1977 and 2017, showing all institutions that placed at least 20 PhDs across the five social sciences disciplines of anthropology, economics, political science, psychology and sociology.\nBlue ribbons dominate the visual space, showing the overwhelming flow from U.S. institutions, mostly elite ones, to these three schools. Harvard leads, followed by Berkeley, Yale and Chicago — the familiar hierarchy of American academic prestige. Purple ribbons represent cross-hiring among the triad, while green ribbons show self-hiring, where institutions recruit their own PhDs (so-called academic inbreeding). Pink ribbons from the London School of Economics, Oxford and Cambridge show some presence from elite U.K. institutions — actually, as much as the rest of Canadian schools combined.\nThe narrow red ribbons tell the most revealing story: the limited access that other Canadian PhD-granting institutions face in placing their PhDs in the triad network. The green ribbon at U of T alone — representing self-hiring — is as thick as all the red ribbons combined.\nPhD Placement Patterns at Canada’s 12 Other Research Universities, 1977-2017\nThis figure shows hiring patterns in Canada’s 12 remaining.  U15 research universities in the same five social sciences disciplines. Red ribbons now dominate the plot, showing robust circulation among Canadian institutions — the Canadianization movement at work.\nThe blue ribbons representing U.S. schools are still present but tell a somewhat different story: The highest-prestige brands like Harvard and Yale represent a smaller proportion of the total, sharing space with respected but less renowned institutions. The grey ribbons show the full national weight of the triad, with U of T (with 261 placements), McGill (139) and UBC (110) serving as the top PhD suppliers to the rest of Canada’s research-intensive academic field. It’s a telling asymmetric relationship: McGill, U of T, and UBC primarily look past Canadian academia and outward to the U.S. for their own hiring, securing national and global prestige in the process, while serving as the primary PhD suppliers to the rest of Canada’s research-intensive universities. These three institutions serve as an interface between the global prestige economy and the domestic Canadian academic ecosystem.\nWe aim to release the Relational-Academia dataset publicly this year. In order to go beyond 2017 and track more contemporary trends, Lachapelle and Burnett’s most recent project, Subfield, has compiled the doctoral origins of all professors employed at Canadian universities across all disciplines for the 2022–23 academic year — the first complete national faculty census of its kind. Such efforts aim to contribute to a critical understanding of how academia and hiring practices are evolving in response to broader institutional and global pressures.\nThe End of Canadianization?\nThe continued dominance of U.S.-trained faculty at the triad is not incidental. Even during the height of the Canadianization movement, the triad retained over 65 per cent U.S.-trained hires, while that number declined to below 50 per cent in other Canadian universities. For the triad, status-group dynamics and hierarchies of prestige likely worked in favour of U.S.-trained candidates.\nThe institutional prestige and visibility of McGill, U of T and UBC likely attracted applicants from elite U.S. programs, whose graduates often carry strong publication records and embedded professional networks. But what counts as a “good scholar” is shaped by more than productivity — status signals, institutional prestige, and cultural fit all matter.  For the rest of the U15, the long-term trend toward Canadian-trained hires may have reflected both policy incentives and a commitment to developing domestic academic capacity, as well as a different applicant pool.\nBut 21st century trends are once again reshaping the landscape. The 2001 policy change that relaxed the Canadian First policy, which had previously required universities to advertise domestically before seeking international applicants, enabled universities to recruit internationally, thus re-inviting the influx of U.S.-trained scholars. This, combined with rising retirements among professors hired during the Canadianization era, an international student gold rush, and intensifying global rankings pressures shifted hiring patterns at schools like McMaster, Waterloo and Western beginning in the early 2000s. Together, these forces have nudged many institutions closer to the gravitational pull of American academia, once again reshaping not only who gets hired but also what Canadian academia aspires to be.\n*\nFrancois Lachapelle, PhD, is the lead scientist at subfield.dev and an academic program market analyst at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan.\nX.

But in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Quebec government made it a ministerial priority, thanks in no small part to the advocacy work of college and university associations. Today, the website Station SME provides an extensive catalogue of mental health resources and services accessible to students.\nJust because mental health services are available on campus, however, doesn’t necessarily mean that students will use them. Even today, a variety of barriers prevent students from accessing the services they need, when they need them. Some derive from students’ personal circumstances, such as their financial resources or time constraints, especially given their academic commitments. Additionally, the effects of poor mental health and past negative experiences may hinder students in seeking help.\nAccessing services isn’t only a personal choice. There are broader sociocultural and institutional factors at play. The visibility, availability and specificity of services in higher-education settings significantly influence accessibility. Similarly, the stigma surrounding mental health issues can discourage some students from reaching out.\nCase management: a promising approach\nSome post-secondary institutions have developed applications and ​​​websites​ to promote their mental-health services, such as the Plant des ressources at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi. While it’s certainly important to communicate the availability of services, this strategy alone is not sufficient, especially when students must wade through a vast array of offerings. Case management, a promising approach used in social work, has already been adopted by a number of institutions.\nIn simple terms, case managers provide individuals with personalized follow-up while coordinating and facilitating access to the institutional and community resources they need.​​ Recent research suggests case management has many benefits in the post-secondary context, from helping students with the transition to campus, to holistically addressing complex​ or specific needs​, to offering appropriate responses during crises, especially those related to social​​ health. However, the academic literature on the implementation and effectiveness of case management in post-secondary settings is relatively scarce and rarely identifies a preferred approach.\nStrengths as a pathway to recovery\nIn mental health, case management has been in wide application around the world since the 1980s. Various models are used, including broker, clinical case management, rehabilitation and​ ​strengths. The Strengths Model, which emerged about forty years ago, is today viewed as one of the most successful at helping individuals towards recovery. It is based on six fundamental principles: 1) everyone can recover; 2) the focus is on strengths rather than limitations; 3) the relationship is primary and egalitarian; 4) ​​​​the client directs the intervention; 5) the ​​intervention takes place in locations that are significant to the client; and 6) the community and environment are essential resources.\nWhile at first glance this model can appear simple, in reality it demands a range of complex skills that are honed in the back-and-forth between training and real-world practice. Champions of this approach highlight the importance of professional supervision. While the Strengths Model is considered effective at assisting individuals with severe mental health issues, its implementation and effectiveness among younger populations are not well documented. Our team’s comprehensive study identified only about ten published studies worldwide on implementing the model for young adults.\nMoving towards strengths-based case management​​?\nFrom the above, two key points emerge: case management appears to effectively address the needs of post-secondary students, and the strengths-based approach supports recovery for individuals living with mental health challenges. Starting from this premise, our team decided to focus on adapting and deploying the Strengths Model in Quebec’s institutions of higher learning. Our initial analyses show that, to varying degrees, practitioners in these settings are already using the core principles of the strengths-based approach. Nonetheless, our findings reveal the need for structured support and ongoing training to ensure that the six principles are truly integrated into practice.\nGoing forward, our ​​research will explore the adaptations needed for the Strengths Model to function in post-secondary settings. This will then pave the way for developing methods to assess its implementation and effectiveness.\nThis article is part of a  series on student mental health in higher education produced by the Observatoire sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur (OSMÉES) (Observatory on student mental health in higher education) and the Initiative sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur (ISMÉ) (Student Mental Health Initiative in Higher Education).\nChristiane Bergeron-Leclerc, Jacques Cherblanc, Eve Boily, Eve Pouliot, Julie Lane, Benjamin Gallais, François Lauzier-Jobin, Marjolaine Tremblay, Camille Gagnon-Béland, Catherine Roy-Boulanger, Mégane Girard, Marie-Édith Vigneau & Geneviève Reed\nTags\nmental health\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

He works with faculty to develop and adapt courses and content with Indigenous approaches or Indigenous histories relevant to their field, while also trying to foster broader institutional change to integrate Indigenous perspectives in university teaching and learning.\nA registered psychotherapist and board certified behaviour analyst, Mr. Busch has over two decades of experience in mental health. He is also a doctoral student in the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education’s adult education and community development program, where he is a Vanier Scholar and was awarded the 2024 Talent Award from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. He says his original training was very quantitative – “evidence-based practice is the word that we love in the mental health world” – but he experienced a turning point that shifted his approach: his own experience with mental health struggles.\n“Many Indigenous people or First Nations people understand that our communities are filled with constant loss and constant unresolved grief, and this impact of intergenerational trauma is very real,” he says. In his 20s, he had his first real panic attack. “I did the whole classic ‘I think I’m dying’,” he says. “I knew that people who had panic disorders immediately think they’re having a heart attack. They try to find a medical explanation. They refuse to believe that this could possibly be psychological.” Despite knowing this, he followed the same path and went about trying to “cure himself in the most scientific way possible,” he says. While there was some benefit to this approach, the anxiety continued to occupy him and he decided to look elsewhere.\nA Bear Clan member of Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation, a community in northern Manitoba, Mr. Busch was well connected to cultural practice when he was young. However, after suffering intense racism during his teenage years in Saskatchewan, he says he had distanced himself from his Indigeneity. For years, his mother and other relatives encouraged him to attend Sundance, one of their most important ceremonies. “When I started to really struggle with my own mental wellness and I wasn’t finding answers anywhere, I thought, well, what the hell?” and “the first time I attended Sundance was just a radical change in my perspective,” he says.\nHe says that he doesn’t think that healing within First Nations communities will come from external mental health systems. “I think it will come from the development of the natural helping systems that are already there,” he says. Western institutions not only fail to acknowledge these systems, he says, but they actively suppress them. “There’s so much potential for those resources to be leveraged in a way that could be really meaningful.”\nHe became interested in the idea of helpers and helping work in all forms, “whether it’s a mental health professional, an elder, a knowledge keeper, a traditional practitioner, a natural helper in community,” he says. They don’t all have a designated role, but they’re seen by the community as leaders and as helpers. His doctoral research reflects this, and he hopes to articulate the conceptual, practical and relational aspects of helping work as described by Indigenous helpers. He has been visiting communities in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, focusing on Cree helpers. “My hope is that by developing a coherent theory of helping work it could be applied in the development of culturally relevant mental health practices,” he says.\nMr. Busch’s doctoral supervisor Jennifer Wemigwans says that his grounding in Indigenous knowledge has enabled him to “take that paradigm and use it in the health field – in a colonial field and space but bring in this diverse knowledge.” By doing that, he is “really shaking up and creating a new space in health research, in health in the community and in health resources,” she says. “I really feel that it’s important that we start to honor and acknowledge Indigenous knowledge within its own right and start to say how this is a valuable contribution in these spaces,” says Dr. Wemigwans.\nIn his new position, Mr. Busch has the opportunity to extend his impact across a range of disciplines. He says he is hoping to take “a teach-a-man-to-fish approach” to the role, where faculty work with communities to develop resources and materials that could be used on an ongoing basis. “There’s a finite amount of knowledge resources in community,” he says. “It’s a bit challenging for institutions to rely fully on Indigenous knowledge keepers, elders, scholars, researchers, to do the work of indigenization, decolonization, reconciliation, etc.” An important part of his role will be supporting faculty to do some of that work in a way that is informed by communities and is Indigenous-led, but that it isn’t a brain drain on the communities.\nOne of Mr. Busch’s first projects has been working on a workshop on the terminology associated with Indigenous pedagogies. “We throw these words around – indigenization, decolonization, resurgence, reconciliation – and there is a lot of discussion on all of those terms,” he says. He is working on a resource for faculty that would discuss these terms, their meaning, considerations, controversies and their practical application. He is also conducting an environmental scan of Canadian universities to see what others are doing on Indigenous pedagogy and curriculum development. “I know that there are some folks out there, Indigenous scholars that are just doing some really incredible groundbreaking work in this area and I’m really eager to learn from them.”\nMr. Busch says both of his parents are lifelong helpers and he has always felt a sense of responsibility to give back to community. “I’m also a Bear Clan member,” he says, “and in this clan system, there is a kinship responsibility.” Each clan has different responsibilities to community, such as leadership or education. “Bears have their nose to the ground and are always sniffing out the different medicines,” he says. “The idea is that the Bear Clan are kind of the carriers of medicine. They’re like the helpers and healers. I take that responsibility seriously and I try to align my values with those kinship responsibilities.”\nSparrow McGowan\nSparrow McGowan is a freelance journalist, writer and editor based in Ottawa.\nTags\nAutochtones\nIndigenous\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Stretching from Halifax Harbour to downtown Vancouver, these postsecondary institutions have been educating graduates for more than a century. Despite that history, their contribution to Canadian culture and economy remains underrecognized. Now, the leaders of Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD) University, NSCAD University, Alberta University of the Arts (AUArts) and Emily Carr University of Art + Design (ECU) have joined forces to form a new coalition. Tentatively named the UAD4 it aims to amplify their impact through a collective voice.\n“Essentially you could say we are the engine that creates arts and culture in this country,” says Ana Serrano, OCAD University’s president and vice-chancellor. “And as the engine that accelerates and develops the talent feeding into the entire creative economy in this country, we have an outsize role to play in how the Canadian future unfolds and evolves.”\nPhoto courtesy of: OCAD University\nThere are scores of art and design programs in Canada, but only four publicly funded universities entirely committed to these areas of study. Founded between the late 1870s and mid-1920s as vocational schools for largely male visual artists, they now offer programs in an array of art, design, media and creative disciplines. Programs range from the classics – such as painting, sculpture or photography – to contemporary specialities such as environmental design, integrated media and experimental animation. OCAD U is Canada’s largest, with 17 undergraduate and seven master’s degrees while Vancouver’s Emily Carr consistently ranks among the top 25 art and design universities in the world.\n“We recognize that there’s more that holds us together than separates us,” says Trish Kelly, ECU’s president and vice-chancellor. “This is a real opportunity to think about not just what we do for our local economies in context, but what we do for Canada. That’s really what this is about.”\nThe four schools have a combined total of 10,000 students each year – about half the size of Canada’s smallest research university. But UAD4 leaders are proud to note that their graduates’ impact defies expectations.\nThe creative sector contributes more than $50 billion to the national economy each year and employs nearly 740,000 people. While UAD4 grads are the sector’s driving force, many Canadians  – and their provincial governments – remain unclear, or maybe even unaware, of the extent to which art and design universities are crucial to the economy, say their leaders. “It’s easy to see why people miss what happens at arts school. But to be honest, our students and our alum are changing the world around us anyway,” says Dr. Kelly.\nThe trope of the struggling artist has long been worn out, say UAD4 leaders. A recent survey by OCAD U shows that more than 80 per cent of students are employed six months after they graduate. Alumni generally find work within their fields as graphic designers, illustrators, and writers among other creative disciplines. But many graduates also go on to work in everything from city planning to advertising and community development. “You name an industry, they’re at the forefront of it,” says Dr. Kelly.\n“It’s easy to see why people miss what happens at arts school. But to be honest, our students and our alum are changing the world around us.”\nThe same survey showed that more than 90 per cent of art and design graduates describe themselves as ‘their own boss.’ “A lot of our students ultimately are creative entrepreneurs that span across multiple sectors,” says Ms. Serrano. “The idea that somehow you go to art school, you become an artist, and that the artist is starving is a very traditional way of thinking about what is actually happening.”\n‘All of our programs are expensive.’\nA primary motivator for the coalition is the financial uncertainty that continues to plague Canada’s postsecondary education sector. The cap on international student study permits  imposed by the federal government in 2024 cut by nearly half a significant source of revenue for universities, while in some provinces operating grants have not kept pace with inflation. “Let’s face it, it isn’t exactly the smoothest sailing for universities right now,” says Dr. Kelly.\nAdding to that financial burden, the UAD4 face distinct challenges. Much of art and design teaching is practice-based education whereby students learn from practitioners in their field in a hands-on learning environment with small class sizes, such as a studio or workshop. Classes generally require expensive materials and technology – from oil paints and precious metals to 3D printers, laser cutters and virtual reality headsets. “We need state-of-the-art tools and facilities to train the next generation in both an academic and more industrial environment. It’s very expensive,” says president emeritus Peggy Shannon of NSCAD University, formally the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. Dr. Shannon, who previously served as chair of the school of performance at Toronto Metropolitan University, says at larger universities, the costs of practice-based classes or studios can be fiscally balanced by larger, revenue-generating lecture-based courses.\nArt and design universities aren’t afforded this luxury, and it’s a ubiquitous problem across the UAD4. “It’s harder to pack thousands of students into labs when they’re meant to be working with their hands,” says Ms. Serrano. “Part of our challenge, and opportunity, is figuring out how to bring that studio-based education into the 21st century.”\nLocal and regional communities\nOne of the goals of the UAD4 is to help both the public and provincial governments understand how art and design universities benefit their local economies. Over half of NSCAD graduates launch their own companies, not-for-profits or galleries, while the large majority find work in a creative field. “They contribute to the workforce,” says Dr. Shannon, “That’s obvious to me, but not necessarily to others.”\nThe province of Nova Scotia is currently trying to double its population to 2 million by 2060 to address labour shortages and boost its economy. But the provincial government doesn’t always make the connection between achieving that goal and Nova Scotia’s cultural scene, says Dr. Shannon. “Halifax and Nova Scotia are beautiful, and we offer the art and culture of the province and this region. I wouldn’t want to move to a new place just to be a doctor – I’d like it to be a nice place to live,” she says. One of the university’s three campuses is situated in the Halifax port, where 350,000 tourists pass every day. “We call it our front yard. We are contributing to what tourists see, think and feel about Halifax.”\nPhoto by: Caitlin Boyle\nAlberta University of the Arts, which is set to celebrate its 100th anniversary next year, is the largest employer of artists in Calgary. “The way we engage with the city is through the work that our faculty, alumni and students are doing,” says president emeritus Daniel Doz. The university partnered with the City of Calgary in 2023 to have alumni design visuals for concrete safety barriers that were installed between traffic lanes and summer patios. During the pandemic, “garage art” galleries popped up throughout Calgary’s residential neighbourhoods – nearly 40 per cent of those exhibits were AUArts alumni. “So [those examples] are the kind of thing, the visual interaction, where the influence isn’t in your face but maybe a little more subtle,” adds Dr. Doz. “When you’re the art school in town, our influence is relevant everywhere, depending on who wants to engage with us.”\nHowever, Dr. Doz admits that having that relevance recognized by the provincial government is challenging. The relationship between postsecondary institutions and the government has shifted significantly since he first became leader 15 years ago. “Postsecondary institutions are perceived as an instrument of economic prosperity – which is not false, each institution has an economic footprint,” he says. “But the relationship has shifted to how does it support a political agenda … because politicians now, their horizon is the next election.”\nIt’s the job of the UAD4 leaders to try to align their missions with that more narrow-minded focus of how some politicians look at the future. “That tension is challenging to navigate at the provincial level, so the four of us can have a little more weight by really sharing that message,” he says.\nUnique student body\nThe diversity of the student body is another unique characteristic of art and design universities. At AUArts, more than a third of students have at least one declared disability, while at NSCAD that number rises to about 42 per cent, with mental heath and learning challenges being the most prevalent. The two universities also have a high number of students who identify as 2SLGBTQ: 60 per cent at AUArts and more than three-quarters at NSCAD.\n“You have a population that exists in art school that society would say exists on the fringe,” says Dr. Doz. Arts schools are often the place where they find community, acceptance and support.\nAlberta University for the Arts also has a higher number of Indigenous students compared to most universities, not only for of its location on Treaty 7 territory but because of its style of teaching. “We teach by making – much in the oral tradition,” he says. “I have an Elder Council and the bands and reserves that they come from, it’s all oral history. When you teach by looking at things, by talking and then making, it caters to people who don’t learn in a traditional way.”\nIndigenous representation at the institution has helped guide the “artistic and cultural conversations” that have occurred across Western Canada, according to Dr. Doz. He points to alum and world-renowned First Nations artist Alex Janvier, who is considered a pioneer of contemporary and abstract Indigenous art.\n“We need state-of-the-art tools and facilities to train the next generation in both an academic and more industrial environment. It’s very expensive.”\nDr. Kelly, at ECU, says the school’s Health and Design Lab is symbolic of how art and design universities bring criticality and awareness to Canada’s progress on goals including truth and reconciliation. For instance, the lab’s interdisciplinary team includes design students, faculty and research associates who partner with the ECU’s Aboriginal Gathering Place. Together, they host Elders, nurses, health care workers and community organizations to create and share stories about racism in the health care system and amplify voices often missing in conversations about systemic health inequities.\n“I’ve had the privilege to be witness to some of those gatherings. But I can only say they’ve brought light and hope and even joy to those individuals who’ve come together to communicate about these difficult issues,” says Dr. Kelly.\nWhile the coalition is still in its nascent stage, the UAD4 aim to meet quarterly to discuss the best way to advocate for their collective needs – but also for a better future for Canadians.  Ms. Serrano, who co-chairs the Open Democracy project, an initiative that develops partnerships to reimagine democracy, says art and design skills are essential to graduates that will help define systems for the future. “What artists and designers know well is that they don’t know what will come next,” she says. Being comfortable with what might emerge – in the artistic process or in society – provides an adaptability that “everyone needs” in a rapidly changing place.\nThat unique perspective is invaluable  when tackling complex questions about how to move forward in the face of national and international problems. Artists and designers, says Dr. Kelly, can help imagine solutions to the “complex, knotted, sticky problems” facing Canadian society.\n“My concern is how to instill hope, how to make sure we are actually moving in a coherent and strategic way to make change in a world that quite dramatically needs it,” she says. “If we can’t apply curiosity, imagination and creativity to those sticky problems, we’re never going to find solutions.”\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

What are the long-term effects of the gender imbalance on campus –– and what can we do about it?\nBy\nSonia Mendes\nApril 30, 2025\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nGraphic by: Edward Thomas Swan\nRead this article in French\n2 Comments\nWhen Tia Lovegrove walked into her political science class on the first day of a new semester in January 2025 she was struck with a realization.\n“There was only one male student in that class; out of 25, I saw one male student,” says Ms. Lovegrove, a fourth-year student completing a double major in political science and law, justice and society at Dalhousie University in Halifax.\nOver the past four years, she has grown accustomed to seeing few males in her classes, particularly in law classes.\n“In half my classes, we have barely any male enrolment,” says Ms. Lovegrove, who plans to pursue law school after she completes her undergraduate degree. “I feel like it’s almost normalized that if you’re going into these classes there’s not going to be very many male students in them; no one has really ever said anything.”\nMs. Lovegrove’s experience reflects a reality that Canada’s postsecondary institutions seem reticent to discuss: Campuses are dominated by female students while male enrolment has stagnated –– and it’s been happening for decades.\nOn average, postsecondary campuses consist of 56.1 per cent women and 43.9 per cent men, according to 2022-23 data from Statistics Canada.\nIn 2024-25, undergraduate students at Dalhousie consisted of 54 per cent females and 44 per cent males (with two per cent of students identifying as “other”). Female enrolment was slightly higher amongst graduate students, with 57 per cent females, 42 per cent males (one per cent identifying as “other”). By faculty, female undergraduates dominated in agriculture, architecture, arts and social sciences, health, science, dentistry, law and even medicine. Only the faculties of computer science, engineering, and management had higher male enrolment.\n“We are aware of the ongoing challenges in achieving balanced gender representation across various fields of study,” a Dalhousie spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement to University Affairs. “We are committed to identifying and addressing barriers to ensure that all students, regardless of gender, feel supported in pursuing their academic and professional aspirations.” When asked whether the university has any specific measures to address the gender imbalance the spokesperson declined comment, reiterating that university administrators “monitor and measure many aspects of our enrolment data.”\nAt the University of Montreal, the numbers are considerably higher. A 2022 UdeMNovelles article noted that nearly seven out of every 10 students at the university were women. Statistics from 2024 are consistent with that figure, with over 67 per cent of students identifying as female.\n“The statistics have been stable over the last few years, and it’s true that the trend has reversed, with more women than men in higher education,” wrote a University of Montreal spokesperson in an emailed statement. “It’s also worth noting that more girls are graduating from high school, so the pool of women applying to pursue their studies at university is correspondingly larger. The issue of gender-based recruitment is a sensitive one these days; that’s why we advocate that our recruitment strategies are as inclusive as possible.”\nBack in the classroom, Ms. Lovegrove worries that student discussions at Dalhousie are often missing the male perspective.\n“In a political science class, or focusing on big topics like human rights, I feel like you do have to have multiple perspectives to be able to fully understand such a big issue,” she says.\nAt Carleton University in Ottawa, Cara Gordon shares similar concerns.\n“It’s definitely imbalanced; we kind of joke about it,” says Ms. Gordon, a third-year journalism and humanities student. “In humanities, we’re a class of about 30 right now and in my year I believe there’s six guys.”\nIn one of her seminar groups, which are intended to facilitate discussion, there are no males at all, she adds.\n“I was thinking, ‘Would the guys bring something up that we wouldn’t think about?’” she says.\nThings haven’t always been so lopsided in the journalism and humanities program, says Dr. Gregory MacIsaac, associate professor of humanities at Carleton.\n“It wasn’t the case when the program started [in 2014]; almost half the class was men,” recalls Dr. MacIsaac, who helped to design the program, offered jointly by the university’s college of the humanities and journalism and communication school. “And then that started to go down slowly. Over the last three years, in a class of 30, there were like seven or five males.”\nDr. MacIsaac admits he’s perplexed by the dwindling male enrolment. Carleton University declined interview requests with their recruitment and enrolment team members and did not provide a statement about the imbalance of gender enrolment.\n“It really has changed; I don’t know why,” he says. “It’s very tempting to come up with an easy answer and say, ‘Oh, well, you’re doing humanities and that just is soft,’ and it appeals to women more than men, but it’s rather insulting and sexist.”\nIn fact, findings from a recent study at the University of Zurich directly supports the theory that men selectively leave occupations and specializations, and devalue them, when the number of women in these jobs increases –– a concept sometimes called the “male flight theory.”\n“When comparing two hypothetical occupations that are identical in all occupational characteristics and only differ in the share of female inflow (25% vs. 75%), the analysis shows that men are twice as likely to leave the feminizing occupation,” according to lead researcher Dr. Per Block, professor of sociology at the University of Zurich.\n“Young males are dropping out of the labour force. They are dropping out of school. They are nowhere. They’re in their parents’ basements, and I think that’s very scary for the future.”\nLong-term economic and social impacts\nMiana Plesca, a professor in the department of economics and finance at the University of Guelph, doesn’t mince words about the state of male postsecondary enrolment.\n“There are nearly two girls for every boy that graduates,” says Dr. Plesca of the overall female to male ratio. “Young males are dropping out of the labour force. They are dropping out of school. They are nowhere. They’re in their parents’ basements, and I think that’s very scary for the future.”\nFor the 2022-2023 academic year at Guelph, 60 per cent of undergraduate students were female. Dr. Plesca explains she has studied the trend with her students and the gender gap goes back decades.\n“We went back with some students to the first year of the labour force survey, where we could find data –– in 1978,” she says. “Already in 1978 more women were graduating than men; it’s not a recent phenomenon.”\nAs a specialist in labour economics, Dr. Plesca says she’s concerned that males opting out of postsecondary education will have a hard time in the future labour market.\n“Economists worry because of skill,” she explains. “Skill is ever more important; with AI and everything, low-skill jobs are getting obsolete and they’re getting replaced by robots, and you need high-skilled workers. And because of the university access, the high-skilled workers in the labour force are more likely to be female.”\nStagnating male enrolment is not just a Canadian issue. Dr. Claudia Buchmann is a distinguished professor of sociology at The Ohio State University. In 2013 she co-authored a book with Thomas A. DiPrete called The Rise of Women: The Growing Gender Gap in Education and What it Means for American Schools.\n“This is pretty much a global trend,” says Dr. Buchmann. “In the book we have a map of the world that shows, at the time of writing, that for the majority of countries in the world, especially industrialized countries, now more women are enrolled in higher education and complete college degrees everywhere in the world. That was pretty striking to us.”\nLike Dr. Plesca, Dr. Buchmann is concerned for the long-term economic well-being of men.\n“By all arguments, the college degree still is very much an important piece of social mobility,” she says, noting that in the U.S., a college degree is ranked at the same academic level as a university degree.\nBeyond potentially stunted earning potential, Dr. Buchmann worries about intangible gaps in male socialization.\n“Think about what higher education can do in terms of being able to develop critical thinking, being able to be presented with diverse ideas or views from people who come from very different perspectives,” she says, adding that “Education for Citizenship” is her university’s motto. “It’s important to be in those social environments, interacting with someone that’s very different from you –– an international student or a student from a different part of the country, from a rural area versus an urban area.”\nShe points to worrisome ideologies in the U.S. which have been creeping into Canada as well.\n“Schools are just a microcosm of what’s being reflected in the larger society,” she explains. “And in the United States right now, we have a really serious problem of the resurgence of this kind of patriarchal notion of ‘make America great again,’ and [the threat to] traditional family structures. And all of these things are, I think, largely due to the fact that some young men are feeling the decline in patriarchy has meant that they’re worse off and that women are to blame for that.”\nChoosing a different path\nSo, what are young men doing if they’re not choosing to attend postsecondary institutions? In Canada, some are lured by the entry-level earning potential of the oil patch. Kyle Cyr, now 24, graduated from high school in Edmonton in 2019. Although he had respectable grades in high school and university was “definitely a possibility,” Mr. Cyr jumped at the chance to earn some good money instead.\n“I ended up getting a job basically the weekend after I graduated, working just south of Edmonton in Nisku on an oil rig; I worked there for just over 10 months,” he says. “Jumping out of high school and then earning oil rig money, it was pretty crazy.”\nUltimately, he says the money wasn’t enough to keep him there for the long run.\nSo Mr. Cyr took on several roles, including as a barista at a climbing gym and a greenskeeper at a golf course, before finding work he loves at Rabbit Hill, a ski resort on the banks of the North Saskatchewan River. Today, as the terrain park supervisor, he manages staff and uses heavy machinery to build the jumps and rails for snowboarding.\n“Being able to do a job that involves my passion, I couldn’t ask for anything else,” enthuses Mr. Cyr, who has been an avid snowboarder since the age of 12. “Obviously it doesn’t pay as well as some other jobs would, but at the same time, I’m willing to sacrifice that little bit of pay for waking up and actually being excited to go to work.”\n“K to 12 should pay a bit more attention to why girls do better than boys in school –– pay more attention to pedagogy and see what makes boys more motivated and engaged.”\nKieran O’Donnell, 19, also opted out of college or university. While attending high school in Ottawa, he considered several career paths.\n“I thought about going to other industries, like electrician, where you obviously need to go to college to get your certificates,” he recalls, adding he always did well in school despite not loving it. “I wanted to be a paramedic at one point; I had a bunch of ideas bouncing around.”\nIt was the thought of enduring more lecture-style classes that altered Mr. O’Donnell’s trajectory.\n“I was just sitting in class and I thought, ‘I cannot do this for another two to four or whatever, how many years,” he says.\nWhen he was 16, Mr. O’Donnell had worked with an interlock company as part of a high school co-op program. That experience turned out to be life-changing.\n“I’m one of those kids who just can’t sit still; I’ve always got to be doing something,” he says. “Co-op was an amazing opportunity for me, as it was for many people, specifically males.”\nWhile still in Grade 12, he launched his own contracting business –– O’Donnell Contracting –– specializing in interlock patios and garden beds. Like Kyle Cyr, Mr. O’Donnell loves the physical, outdoor nature of his work.\n“One thing I love about my job is I’m outside,” he says. “I’m talking to people, I’m enjoying the beautiful summer; I just love what I do.”\nMr. O’Donnell notes that the financial investment required for a postsecondary education was a deterrent for him.\n“Knowing I wanted to go into business and be making money, going into school to spend a bunch of money before you even made any seems like a step backwards for me,” he says. “I have no student debt. I’ve been working.”\nFinding new ways to engage male students\nKyle Cyr and Kieran O’Donnell are examples of bright, young men who chose not to pursue postsecondary education. To encourage more men to continue their education, Dr. Plesca suggests the Canadian public school system should consider how boys learn differently compared with their female peers.\n“K[indergarten] to [Grade] 12 should pay a bit more attention to why girls do better than boys in school –– pay more attention to pedagogy and see what makes boys more motivated and engaged,” says Dr. Plesca, who notes her own son struggled in the school system compared to her daughter. “I don’t think that girls perform better than boys once they graduate. I think they perform equally well. But K to 12 shows them [girls] as performing better because it rewards certain skills: They’re more organized, they’re more disciplined, they pay more attention.”\nExtensive research on gender, mobility and college attainment support Dr. Plesca’s suggestions. In their report entitled The Secret Behind College Completion, published by the U.S. think tank Third Way, Dr. Buchmann and Columbia University professor Thomas A. DiPrete suggest that “because boys’ academic deficit is well established by middle school, reforms targeting the early and middle school years offer the greatest potential for closing the gender gap in college completion.”\nThe report goes on to say that a student’s academic future can already be forecast by the time they hit middle school, based on key indicators.\n“We found that eighth grade grades are a very strong predictor, using nationally representative data, of the likelihood of persisting in college and getting a college degree,” says Dr. Buchmann. “These things start earlier than perhaps some people think.”\nDr. Buchmann also suggests there could be more teamwork between high schools and postsecondary institutions, to help bridge the gap for students who are on the fence.\n“Colleges can do things like having summer preparation programs, or more collaboration with high schools,” she says. “Maybe take a class at the college level while they’re in high school and explore it.”\nIn light of widespread funding issues in North America and beyond, there are no strong indications that postsecondary institutions are interested in addressing the gender gap. To do so could be construed as discriminatory, argues Dr. Plesca.\n“What are we going to do, put quotas?” asks Dr. Plesca. “If we put quotas, girls are going to sue us; if according to the admission criteria women look better than men, women might say, ‘No, this is discrimination.’ So, it’s a very slippery slope.”\nDr. Buchmann predicts the financial pinch currently being faced by U.S. colleges, partly due to declining enrolment and rising operating costs, will drive postsecondary institutions to offer more variety.\n“Universities here [in the U.S.] are grappling with just how to stay in business, many of them; a lot of universities will probably fail in the next decade in this country,” she says. “So [they will need to consider] creating new programs, creating new certificate kinds of programs or new things that don’t require four years.\nThe hope, says Dr. Buchmann, is that these efforts will be enough to better engage male students.\n“We need men and women in all of the fields that make up a healthy society and economy.”\nSonia Mendes\nSonia Mendes is a freelance writer and editor based in Ottawa.\nTags\nMale enrolment\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(2 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Enrolment numbers for male students in post-secondary have been comparatively low for years! None of this is news. We kept telling our boys that they are not good enough because they underperform and underachieve; therefore we have raised men who shrug their shoulders in resignation. We cannot plant peas and reap corn! Haven’t we  as a society reaped what we have sowed?\nReply\nLorne Carmichael\nMay 1, 2025 at 10:00 am\nI published an article in University Affairs on Sept 1, 2015 related to this topic. It was entitled “Male – Female Imbalance in STEM Comes Down to Economics”. For some reason the search feature here does not seem to go back this far, but I can quote the final lines:\n“Current educational policies focus on encouraging girls in math and science. What if we put the same energy into helping boys do better in all the other subjects? This would increase the proportion of women in STEM by giving boys an alternative. At the same time it might begin to address the other major equity problem in our universities – the severe under-representation of males.\nSurely this is a policy we can all support.”\nWell, I guess I was wrong. Since then Jordan Peterson has been vilified for encouraging young men to grow up, many young women are finding it impossible to find a partner they can respect, and our equity professionals remain uninterested.\nReply\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMore from Features\nFeatures\nInternational students\nInside the life of an international student\nEvery day brings new adventures, challenges and opportunities for a student coming from abroad.\nby\nSelena Phillips-Boyle\nMay 26, 2025\nFeatures\nArts\nNew coalition forms to advocate for art and design universities\nIt’s time to shine light on the impact of art and design schools, say presidents.\nby\nHannah Liddle\nMay 14, 2025\nFeatures\nPolicy\nThe challenges facing Nova Scotia’s postsecondary institutions\nUnexpected government policy changes have choked off revenues while rising costs threaten to topple painstakingly balanced budgets.\nby\nAngela Mombourquette\nApril 23, 2025\nFeatures\nPolicy\nUniversities at a political crossroads\nCanadian universities are facing uncertain prospects as they weigh the\nLiberal Party’s mixed record on postsecondary education against\nConservative threats to EDI initiatives and research funding.\nby\nMohamed Berrada\nApril 16, 2025\nMore from Enrolment\nFeatures\nEnrolment\nWhy medical faculties are broadening admissions criteria\nUniversities across the country are tweaking their admissions processes to attract students from less-privileged backgrounds.\nby\nWendy Glauser\nMarch 04, 2020\nOpinion\nEnrolment\nWhere are all the international students universities were promised when Trump was elected?\nDespite a widespread media narrative claiming students would be flocking to Canada, universities did not see a “Trump bump.”\nby\nCreso Sá\nMarch 02, 2020\nNews\nEnrolment\nInternational student enrolment continues to soar in Canada\nDespite the success, the country’s universities look to diversify the source countries to avoid over-reliance on a few key nations.\nby\nMoira MacDonald\nMay 06, 2019\nThe University Affairs Newsletter\nKeeping Canada’s university community informed, inspired and connected\nEmail\nEmail\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n2648\nTopics\nAcademic freedom\nAdvice\nArtificial intelligence\nClimate change\nCopyright\nEquity\nIndigenous\nInternational students\nMental health\nResearch\nPublishing\nTeaching\nIn-depth\nFeatures\nNews\nArticles\nPeople on the move\nCampus Currents\nOpinion\nArticles\nSubmissions\nCareer Advice\nArticles\nSubscribe\nWays to subscribe\nPodcast\nRead the digital edition\nUniversity Affairs\nAbout us\nContact us\nAdvertise\nIssue archives\nJobs\nSearch Jobs\nUA Footer Symbol\nUniversity Affairs\nUniversity Affairs\nFacebook\nYoutube\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nAccessibility\nCopyright\nUniversity Affairs Privacy Notice\n© Universities Affairs 2025.

Underlying much of its growth has been a simple problem with no clear solution: a drastic lack of permanent academic positions compared to the number of PhD graduates produced in Canadian universities. GPD programming now provides career support for PhD students that was often absent in the past, and it has undoubtedly aided many PhD students in preparing for the transition away from academia. The underlying problem, however, has not gone away, and neither PhD programs nor the job market show signs of adapting to accommodate the overproduction of PhDs. When it comes to facilitating career transition, have we reached the limit of what GPD can offer within the structural constraints of the university system and the Canadian job market? I pose this question as we enter a time of austerity for higher education in Canada, knowing that permanent academic jobs or postsecondary teaching positions of any kind will become increasingly scarce, and that broader economic troubles may also be on the horizon.\nGPD, from the beginning, has focused on skills rather than knowledge — the latter being the domain of the various academic disciplines. A key document in the development of GPD in Canada is the 2012 report prepared by Marilyn Rose for the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in which she identified a need for training in transferable skills for graduate students, as well as for instruction on how graduate students can reframe their academic skills and describe them to potential employers. This focus on transferable skills and skill translation is now a key part of GPD.\nThe hard reality that this skills discourse continues to obscure, however, is that no student completes a PhD program for the sake of developing transferable or translatable skills. It is also not clear to what extent high-level academic skills — in critical thinking, deep analysis, knowledge synthesis, and similar — are transferable or translatable from one realm of knowledge to another, or if those gained from a PhD are that much different from those gained from a master’s degree once they are removed from a disciplinary context.\nThere are limits in the non-academic job market as well, which still does not demand PhDs. (The 2021 report by the Council of Canadian Academies, Degrees of Success, addressed this problem.) While PhD graduates are typically capable people who will eventually find decent work, we know that there are still few non-academic jobs that require PhDs or make full use of PhD-level academic skills. Certainly, there are none that provide opportunities for self-directed research of the scope and depth that is characteristic of academic research.\nSo is this it? Is this the best we can do? It may be all we can do as people working in GPD. There could, however, be something that disciplines can do by rethinking the purpose of PhD programs. By this I do not mean making PhD programs something different than what they have always been. What makes PhD programs important and worth keeping is not ultimately the skills they provide but the disciplinary knowledge they help create, preserve and transmit. PhD programs socialize students within an academic discipline and train them to be scholars. I suggest that instead of relying on GPD and the language of transferable and translatable skills to expand the definition of what PhD students can do, academic disciplines can work to expand the definition of what constitutes scholarship, who can carry it out, and where it should take place.\nWill professional academic research remain an all-or-nothing career option, confined to lifelong institutional positions accessible to comparatively few PhDs, or can it be somehow distributed among the vast numbers of PhDs whose knowledge and academic skills remain chronically underutilized?\nWe can encourage public scholarship — as GPD programs increasingly do — but for most PhD students, any skills they develop in this field will be put to use after graduation in contexts outside of the realm of specialized disciplinary knowledge. In the end, it is up to faculty to decide how to create sustainable futures for their disciplines and how society can harness the collective disciplinary expertise of the PhDs they have trained. I can only say that GPD and the skills discourse, however crucial they are for helping PhD graduates make the best of an unfortunate situation, will not be enough. We seem to have reached a limit, and the question is where to go from here.\nDavid Lafferty\nDavid Lafferty is a professional development coordinator\nin graduate studies at Carleton University\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(2 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

The research project itself should be what is funded on merit – we have to stop thinking of grants as propping up universities.\nReply\nValentina Galvani\nJune 4, 2025 at 4:45 pm\nGreat article. Three throughts.\n1. Faculty members in disciplines for which there is no obvious pathway to non-academic jobs could take a first step by being very honest with prospective students about the probability of entering academia after graduation. It is sad to see faculty members taking on Ph.D. students and advising them on topics for which they know there is no Plan B and no (or almost none) academic positions.\n2. Let’s not forget that there are students taking on the Ph.D. to facilitate immigration. For these students, point 1 above does not necessarily apply.

It looks like my institution is going to take advantage of the volatility in the U.S. right now by poaching one or more U.S.-based faculty. What do established researchers new to the Canadian funding environment need to know to be successful with the Tri-Agency?\n– Anonymous, Research Grants Facilitation\nA. In many ways, moving to an institution in a new country is like going back to school: there are new people, new systems, new norms, maybe even new words to learn.\nAnyone who is the first in their family to attend university knows about the hidden curriculum — the unwritten norms, values, behaviours, and expectations implicit within academia, distinct from disciplinary knowledge and methods. If you come from a family that has experience of university, you’re more likely to be equipped with the cultural capital necessary to navigate academic systems than someone who is a first-gen university student.\nAnd the hidden curriculum isn’t bounded to degree programs: it persists among faculty roles as well.\nFaculty members new to the Canadian funding system need to be aware of the presence of unwritten rules within the Tri-Agency. Consider, for example, equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). I recently found myself reading the Canadian Council of Academies’ report Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in the Post-Secondary Research System, and found myself disagreeing with some of its findings, including its claim that applicants to SSHRC’s Insight Grant (IG) competition “are not required to explain the relevance of EDI to research design and practice in their proposals, and evaluators do not take these considerations into account during the peer review process” (2024, p. 102).\nThe evaluation criteria for the SSHRC IG may not state that peer reviewers are scoring applicants’ integration of EDI, access, Indigenization, decolonization, and intersectionality in the design of their research projects and their plans for student training, but—contrary to the report’s assertion—these factors are indeed considered during the peer review process. Talk to any recent SSHRC peer reviewer and they’ll verify that for you. I advise the researchers who I support that peer reviewers do want to see, for instance, disaggregated data analysis and inclusive, culturally safe working and learning environments for all members of a research team. EDI is being scored, even though it isn’t mentioned explicitly in the IG evaluation criteria.\nBecause I’ve long wanted to see the unwritten rules of research grant applications written down, I’ve been interviewing former Tri-Agency peer reviewers. In January 2025, I shared a document called Peer Reviewers’ Perspectives: NFRF Exploration & Transformation; in the coming months, I’ll be publishing the parallel documents for the CIHR Project, and NSERC Discovery competitions.\nThis month, I’m focusing on the SSHRC Insight and Insight Development competitions. I interviewed 49 former IG and Insight Development Grant (IDG) peer reviewers from across all the review committees in these two competitions; this free 46-page PDF contains what I heard from these interviews. In my opinion, the real gems are in the details—but because it would take me 46 pages to convey those details to you, I’d like to highlight my four key takeaways:\nThe budget matters to the penny\nThe SSHRC IG & IDG peer reviewers pay a lot more attention during their scoring to the budget than do peer reviewers for CIHR Project and NSERC Discovery, with a good number of peer reviewers telling me that they see the budget as outlining what a particular project will ‘actually do.’\nSo, instead of saying that your flight to Toronto will cost $600, you should say that it costs $614 or $588—quote a number that shows that you looked up real costs and aren’t simply guesstimating.\nIn November 2024, I wrote an article outlining a three-part budget justification strategy that I recommend for SSHRC applicants:\nJustify why the expense is necessary;\nJustify where the numbers come from; and,\nJustify how the expense was calculated.\nThat specific article was written in response to an IDG applicant, but in truth I use this three-part strategy to explain budget expenses for all SSHRC competitions: the IDG, IG, Connection, Partnership—everything.\nYou need to apply to the right committee\nAt SSHRC, if you’re a labour studies researcher interested in the representations of care work in Belgian graphic novels published in the 1930s, it may not be clear to you if you should apply to the literature committee, the committee that includes gender studies, or one of the multidisciplinary committees.\nI’m always telling my SSHRC applicants to look up last year’s peer review committee members—Google them; find their bios—using the publicly published details on SSHRC’s Merit Review Committees page.\nBy looking up who has served recently on a specific committee, you can get a sense of the range of expertise, methods, and theoretical frames used by that group of peer reviewers. I find that researchers who gather this bit of extra data can make more informed choices than colleagues who are going only on the name of the committee.\nYou want to write meaningful, appropriate training and knowledge mobilization plans\nA lot of researchers who apply for SSHRC funding end up writing standard, conventional student training and knowledge mobilization plans. In the social sciences, students are supporting data collection and analysis, and then they’re co-authoring publications and co-presenting at conferences; in the humanities, the students are updating annotated bibliographies, and then they’re co-authoring publications and co-presenting at conferences. Across disciplines, researchers are promising to write journal articles or chapters for their monograph, to publish an edited collection or a special issue of a journal, to present at conferences, and to submit a piece to The Conversation Canada.\nSuch plans are fine—for many peer reviewers, they wouldn’t prevent a good project from getting funded—but in a tight funding climate, a compelling, original, feasible training or KMb plan that is well-suited to the project can help peer reviewers to distinguish between two otherwise excellent, important research proposals.\nIf you have a fascinating, important, feasible project, and someone else applying to the same committee has a fascinating, important, feasible project, AND a novel, compelling, feasible, appropriate, tailored student training or KMb plan, then they just might be able to eke out the extra point or half-point that they might need to lift their application just that touch higher in the committee’s ranking and thereby get funded over yours.\nHaving said that, it isn’t easy to come up with original, meaningful, feasible and novel ways to train students or share knowledge, especially if you’ve never engaged in original, meaningful, feasible and novel training or KMb in your own undergraduate or graduate degrees. Back in May 2024, I wrote about the University of Toronto’s novel ‘scholars in residence’ program for undergraduates; at UBC, the Arts Amplifier’s collaborative cohort projects offer paid work-integrated learning experiences to small groups of graduate students. If you do community-engaged research, could your RAs work for or with a partner organization for part of their training? Does your institution provide supports for experiential or work-integrated learning that could become a part of your student training plan?\nIf your institution has a strong program in communications, digital media, film, photography, or fine arts, you might be able to recruit talented trainees to support your knowledge mobilization plan—just make sure that there’s someone on the team who can provide them with discipline-relevant advice and feedback, so they’re both working and learning at the same time.\nWhen it comes to knowledge mobilization plans, SSHRC peer reviewers repeatedly told me that the plans must align with the project—there must be a clear and logical fit. If you’re a social science researcher who is using PhotoVoice for data collection, then consider finding a way to enable research participants to opt-in to sharing their photos through an in-person or digital exhibition. Doing so would fit with the visual aspect of your methodology. If you’re a humanities researcher, consider experimenting with the strategies outlined in my February 2022 article, “Against utility and instrumentalization: knowledge mobilization for the humanities.”\nIf everyone applying to SSHRC is making a website, publishing on social media, hosting a one-hour public talk, or writing an article in The Conversation Canada, what can you do that’s different, but that also feels integral to your proposed research? The answer to that question can be a difference-maker for applicants in that frustrating ‘fundable but not sufficiently highly ranked’ zone.\nImportantly, your novel student training or innovative knowledge mobilization plan needs to be feasible, which—for peer reviewers—usually means it’s something you’ve done before. If you’re proposing something new, consider bringing on a co-investigator or collaborator who can support your plans. Doing so will reassure your peer reviewers that you’re not risking drowning alone, overwhelmed by a situation you’ve never been in previously.\nBut that’s just the high-level overview. Different committees have differing expectations—you wouldn’t expect a reviewer in the fine arts to want to see the same things as a reviewer in business studies, would you? I conducted these interviews and am sharing these quotations in the hopes of getting more of the unwritten rules for Canadian research grants written down, spelled out, and made clear.\nIf you’d like, I can email you the full, free 46-page PDF Peer Reviewers’ Perspectives: SSHRC Insight & Insight Development Grant, along with the NFRF guide published earlier this year. I’ll also drop you a note when the parallel guides for the CIHR Project and NSERC Discovery are published in this column next month and the month after.\nI’m coming to Congress!

Instruction should be designed to reinforce this.\nBy\nLoleen Berdahl\nMay 23, 2025\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nPhoto by Mikhail Nilov\n0 Comments\nAcross the disciplines, be it through research papers, reflective essays, written exam questions, or other written artifacts, the act of student writing plays an important role in developing thinking skills. When students outsource their writing assignments to AI, this opportunity to strengthen thinking skills is lost.\nIn my last column, I wrote about the inevitable deskilling that will occur in the AI environment and the importance of proactively preserving “writing as thinking”.” In this column, I explain why I believe this is necessary and how we can do so.\nUnderstanding the connection between writing and thinking\nWhen we attempt to put words to a page, we surface our areas of confidence and confusion, identify the holes in our logics, and bring forward new creative ideas. As Dan Shipper writes, “a certain kind of thinking is only possible through writing. … When you turn the vast, interconnected network of thoughts, feelings, and ideas in your mind into a line of words, you find sequence, order, and story. You expose fallacy and fuzziness. … And writing doesn’t just tell you what you already think somewhere in the cobwebbed attic of your brain. It actively helps you to generate new—and better—thoughts and ideas as you do it.”\nResearch suggests that writing is tied to critical thinking (particularly inference and scientific reasoning) and, over time, changes how the brain functions. Simply put, we become sharper thinkers when we write and more skilled at thinking the more we practice writing. This risks being lost if students abandon writing in favour of AI.\nHow instructors can strengthen the connection between writing and thinking\nTo protect writing as a tool for developing students’ thinking, we must reconsider our teaching approaches. Here are ideas to start:\n1. Emphasize learning and thinking over the written artifact. The ‘products’ of writing are both the learning and improved thinking emerging from the research and writing process and the actual written artifact. We need to use assignment structures and weighting to prioritize learning and thinking,\nDesign assessments can include ‘thinking evidence’. Examples:\nHave students submit both a research paper and an accompanying reflection worksheet in which students answer specific questions. (Examples from John Warner: “What have you discovered that is new to you? What line, idea, or concept occurred to you while writing that you hadn’t planned on? … What do you know now that you didn’t know before?”)\nAccompany scaffolded assessments with a written or oral ‘thought evolution’ assignment in which students explain what changed in their thinking about the topic.\nLeading up to an assessment, have students submit journal entries describing their research and writing process, including what they are learning and how their thinking is evolving.\nUse assessment weightings to convey the importance of thinking and learning. Place high weight on the ‘thinking evidence’ and low weight on elements that can reasonably be done by AI (e.g., grammar, formatting, bibliographic style), unless those elements are an important learning outcome for your course.\n2. Be explicit with students about the linkage between writing and thinking. Ask students to discuss how they have experienced evolution in their own thinking through the writing process. Tell students about how writing improves your thinking.  Play them this short audio clip of Turing Award recipient Leslie Lamport arguing “If you think you understand something, and don’t write down your ideas, you only think you’re thinking.”\n3. Bring writing activities into the classroom. Use classroom activities to promote writing as thinking. For example, have students write their answers to a particular question for five minutes, and then discuss their thinking process with a classmate. The University of Waterloo Centre for Teaching Excellence’s Using Writing as a Learning Tool provides additional activities to consider.\n4. Provide students with writing study prompts.  Provide students with a list of short-answer and essay questions to practice as part of their exam preparation – even if the exam doesn’t include such questions. As Shane Parrish writes, “Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about. … writing about something complicated and hard to pin down acts as a test to see how well you understand it.”\nWriting as thinking: call to action\nPaul Graham argues that AI will lead to “a world divided into writes and write-nots. … Instead of good writers, ok writers, and people who can’t write, there will just be good writers and people who can’t write. …. a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots.”\nI believe that as university instructors we have an opportunity and imperative to push against this. I encourage all of us to do so.\nContinuing the Skills Agenda conversation\nHow do you teach writing as thinking?  I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.\nI look forward to hearing from you. Until next time, stay well, my colleagues.\nLoleen Berdahl\nLoleen Berdahl is a 3M National Teaching Fellow, an award-winning university instructor, the executive director of the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy (Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina), and professor and former head of political studies at the University of Saskatchewan. Since 2016, Dr. Berdahl has spoken about student skills training and professional development at conferences and university campuses across Canada. Her research on these topics was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Insight Grant program. Her most recent book is For the Public Good: Reimagining Arts Graduate Programs in Canadian Universities (with Jonathan Malloy and Lisa Young, University of Alberta Press 2024).\nTags\nTeaching\nwriting\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Let’s weigh the pros and cons.\nBy\nElizabeth Wells\nMay 09, 2025\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nPhoto by: Marko Pekic\nRead this article in French\n1 Comments\nAs we approach summer we are getting into “conference season” – a heady mixture of networking, socializing and of course disseminating our research.  You either love or hate conferences: seeing old friends and hearing about the latest scholarship or schlepping around exhaustedly to different locations for questionable value.  Either way, we have all been or are still on the conference circuit, and so in these economically challenging times it might be good to weigh the pros and cons of this kind of academic activity.\nConferences are particularly important for young scholars and graduate students; indeed you will find this makes up a rather large percentage of conference attendees today.  Scholars need to get their name out, get to know other scholars, and talk to presses and perhaps hiring committees.  As we age, we tend to do fewer of these and focus on publication, since once we are known in our field, we don’t need to show up to “perform” quite as often.  At the same time, conference attendance can be even more attractive and beneficial in a later career: a keynote or invited lecture is something that everyone likes to see on their CV.  There is also the series of social activities, ad hoc or planned, that happens at these conferences, and this can be one of the best benefits to our careers as well as our mental health.  Intellectual stimulation and social connection are important in our mostly isolating research lives, and so there is something very inspiring and invigorating to conference presentation and attendance, especially for people from small departments or small universities and independent scholars.\nHowever, conferences are expensive.  Anywhere from a few hundred dollars to more than $700 are typical costs for just the registration fees.  And then there are often add-on activities or dinners that can cost quite a bit, although they may enrichen the experience.  Banquets at conferences, often provided by corporate caterers, are heavy on the budget and rarely tasty.  Depending on who you are seated with, it could be the connection of a career or a boring wasted evening.  Airfares are exorbitant these days, and in places like New York City, where Airbnb’s were outlawed, the cost of hotels is also quite high.  Sharing a room with a colleague is one possible remedy, especially if it allows you to enjoy a bottle of wine in the room with a grad school buddy, but that is rarely the norm.  And then there are ancillary costs: transportation to and from airports and hotels, coffee and meals, and perhaps the cost of picking up a book at the book table (even on conference discount).  Depending on the location and length of the conference, this can add up to thousands of dollars for only a few intensive days of enjoyment and career advancement.  Not to mention that conferences take away your focus and energy at just the time of year when you want to get some serious work done.\nThe dilemma is that sometimes the most important events (getting a book deal, meeting a collaborator) can happen at conferences.  This has certainly been true for me.  But let’s look at what else you could spend perhaps $2000 to $3000 for an international conference on, if you skipped one such conference a year.\nBooks: From an average academic press, this could be 40 to 60 academic books.  Imagine how that would enhance both your library and your understanding of the field.\nTA or grading assistance: At $20/hour, you would have approximately 150 hours of extra TA or grading assistance, which is almost 12 hours a week for a 13-week term.  Many at large universities have teaching assistants provided from departmental budgets.  For those who don’t, this could be life-altering.\nPost-Doc: You don’t have to get a large grant or a full-time position to find a post-doc who is interested in providing support for your research on an hourly basis.  At $50/hour this would give you 10 hours a week for six weeks in the summer to have a colleague edit, do research, or otherwise support your scholarship.\nProfessional Development:  At costs of $150 and up per hour, you could work with an academic developmental editor or academic coach and improve your work/life balance, or develop your nascent scholarly ideas.\nVacation: Let’s assume you pay for a conference out of your own pocket.  This could get you well on your way to a getaway in the Caribbean or a cruise.  No tax deduction, but a relaxing and restorative trip.\nAlthough this all sounds good, I admit we don’t all have resources to spend on conferences.  However, imagine if we skipped just one expensive event per year and put the money toward any of these other worthy aims.\nWhile we never know when that wonderful opportunity or meeting will happen at a conference, or how it might launch a career – to a certain degree, it’s serendipity – I would suggest weighing your options.  If the attendees include a new body of scholars to you and your work is new or emerging, and your session is very specific, it is probably worth going.  If you are trying to get a book deal and can guarantee facetime with an editor, it is probably worth going.  As for online conferences?  I personally don’t like them because they offer none of the upsides with many of the downsides.  But they are convenient and often very inexpensive or even free.  My best advice is that reducing your live conference attendance by a certain percentage and diverting those funds in other directions (or saving it); you might end up on the winning side of the bargain.\nElizabeth Wells\nElizabeth Wells is a professor of music history and musicology at Mount Allison University as well as author of the book The Organized Academic.\nTags\nHiring\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

I want our campus to be a destination of choice,” she says. Her invitation to “join me,” expressed loud and clear in the days following her appointment, is an unequivocal call to those who wish to contribute to a socially engaged, inclusive and forward-focused university.\nThis warm, open approach builds on an outstanding career that combines laying down local roots and creating an international profile. A renowned interdisciplinary researcher, a graduate in law from the Université de Montréal, with a master’s and a doctorate (SJD) from Harvard, Sylvestre was dean of the Civil Law Section of the Faculty of Law and co-chair of the uOttawa Senate Committee on Academic Freedom. She’s also a member of the board of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the board of governors of the National Judicial Institute and the College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists of the Royal Society of Canada.\nA vision to meet the challenges of our time\nFor Sylvestre, the University of Ottawa must be rooted in its milieu, engage in conversations with people, community partners, and public and private sector decision-makers, and meet community needs. She says that this calling is exemplified by the research currently being done at the University of Ottawa, which she calls “outstanding,” both for its growth and for its relevance. Health care, innovation, artificial intelligence, social justice, the environment: the great challenges of our time are at the heart of the research on campus.\nHer keen understanding of current issues — academic freedom, institutional autonomy, budgetary constraints — fuels her determination to combine academic ambition and responsible management. She thus intends to advocate for the University’s mission, while sustaining the research intensity that has made uOttawa’s reputation in Canada and around the world.\nAmbitious? Realistic and necessary for a president inspired by the power of the collective. Sylvestre sees the University as a focal point: a destination for knowledge, but especially for shared transformation for all. She believes that the University of Ottawa will continue to take its place as a driver of change by drawing on the dynamism of the university community and an influential network of partners.\nStrengthening partnerships, the Francophonie and Indigenization\nThree overarching priorities will shape the start of her term. Firstly, she wishes to strengthen links with the community. Mentioning the unique qualities of the national capital — a centre for policy-making, a diplomatic crossroads, a technological hub and a lively cultural space — Sylvestre sees it as an ecosystem that lends itself to enriching the university experience, stimulating research and innovation, and shedding light on society’s major debates. She also sees the future Advanced Medical Research Centre, as well as partnerships with the Kanata North tech park and affiliated hospitals, as opportunities to connect the campus to its locale.\nHer second priority is promoting the Francophonie in all its diversity and vitality. Sylvestre sees it as a focus of uOttawa’s identity and a concrete commitment. She would like the University to continue to fully serve Franco-Ontarians and play its role as a leader in knowledge promotion and research in French. A Quebec native and a Franco-Ontarian by choice for 20 years, she’s led several promising projects, including the French language certificate in Indigenous laws and the Jurivision.ca platform. For her, the francophonie is a driver of innovation, equity and collaboration.\nFinally, she plans to offer concrete, lasting support for Indigenous knowledge creation and languages. For her, this requires respect, listening and consistency. She would like to strengthen existing relationships with the Algonquin Anishinabeg nation, support Indigenous research, integrate Indigenous knowledge and languages in programs and encourage Indigenous representation and presence among professors and support staff.\nThese priorities set the tone for a strong focus on action as she starts her term.\nAmplifying a movement of ideas, action and innovation\nSylvestre invites researchers, public partners, innovative businesses, regional cultural and social leaders — and everyone else who want to think, build and act — to join with the University of Ottawa. She believes that uOttawa can build a world of possibilities that reflects itself — bilingual, inclusive, vibrant and firmly focused on the future.\n“Together, we will transform our university, our city, our country — and the world in which we live.”\nLolita Boudreault\nLolita Boudreault is the marketing content manager at the University of Ottawa.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

They reminded Dr. Tettey, who began serving as the university’s 17th president on New Year’s Day, of his own academic path — an irrepressible drive to use the post-secondary experience to shape a more equitable and sustainable future.\n“Students have always been at the heart of what universities do,” says Dr. Tettey, “and after spending a short amount of time with Carleton students, getting a feel for the work that is happening here, I can already see that they’re going to advance Canada and the world in new and innovative ways.\n“Our role as an institution is to nurture and cultivate ideas and people, but students are particularly regenerative. They come here with a broad range of experiences and challenge us to rethink how we do things.”\nAn inclusive entrepreneurial mindset\nDr. Tettey started going to school in a lower-class neighbourhood in Accra, the capital and largest city in Ghana — a place that many people consider the “margin of the margins,” he says.\nEven though his mother did not have formal schooling, she was a staunch believer in the power of education. Tettey had regular access to newspapers and the household was a vibrant gathering place for intellectual engagement with older siblings, cousins and friends who loved to debate, showing young Wisdom that curiosity and ideas could expand his world.\n“Education can open so many doors,” he says. “It’s one of those areas where you’re not encumbered by other people’s perceptions of what you should be. You might be sitting in a classroom with people who are economically better off than you, but what matters is your critical engagement with knowledge.\n“Coming to Carleton, I’m excited about helping to give people the chance to be in a space where we can grow to be our best selves and make valuable contributions to society.”\nDr. Tettey has promoted excellence at every institution that he has been part of over the years and notes that this outcome is deepened and expanded by a mutually reinforcing commitment to equity and inclusion.\n“There’s always an opportunity to learn and grow,” he says, “because you can always continue to push the boundaries of knowledge. But, more importantly, we can make a more meaningful and positive impact on society by intentionally fostering a learning and scholarly environment where excellence, equity and inclusion enrich one another.”\nThis approach to education, he says, should be one of the fundamental missions of universities, and the Carleton community’s commitment to it is what intrigued Dr. Tettey upon discovering that the university was looking for a new president.\n“I asked myself, is this a place where I can do the things that I believe in? Does it have the fundamental values and principles that undergird my own motivations?” The move to Carleton, he adds, was the result of a “bidirectional” decision making process.\n“There are tremendous opportunities for Carleton, and also an opportunity for me to continue to grow and contribute in ways that I might not have been able to previously. There’s a stimulating, enriching environment that I can draw from.\n“Relative to other places, Carleton is not as constrained by inflexible ways of doing things,” he continues. “It has a nimbleness, an entrepreneurial mindset and a spirit of innovation that are purposefully inclusive. I want to be part of this adventure.”\nMaintaining the momentum\nOne of Dr. Tettey’s priorities at Carleton will be to enhance the university’s renowned student experience, ensuring that the learning environment is as robust and supportive as possible.\n“We need to have the structures in place,” he says, “so our graduates can be conscientious and adaptable citizens and leaders, whoever they are and wherever they go.”\nAs a globally oriented institution, Carleton is well situated, Dr. Tettey says, to bring the world to campus, whether through research or partnerships or pedagogy. And the university is also poised to radiate out into other spaces to drive intellectual advancement, innovation and community impact.\nThis means, for example, leveraging Carleton’s location in the national capital to promote regional and international partnerships, including expanding the university’s presence in Kanata North, the largest research and technology hub in Canada.\n“These are the types of actions we can take to elevate our institution,” he says. “This is the journey that will lead to great outcomes for society.”\nAD\nAdvertisement\nDan Rubinstein\nDan Rubinstein is the senior writer at Carleton University and the author of Water Borne, forthcoming in June 2025 from ECW Press.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

S. President Donald Trump’s funding cuts and ideological crackdowns hammer American universities, many commentators see a moment of opportunity in which Canada becomes a destination for disaffected and defunded American academics.\nBut hang on just a minute before we roll out the red-and-white carpet.\nThe Americanization of Canadian higher education is already a problem; anecdotal evidence suggests that academics with PhDs from American institutions are often preferred by hiring committees over their Canadian counterparts.   Meeting the current crisis in the U.S. with calls to intensify this process risks entirely squeezing out Canadians from their own labour market. After all, unlike family doctors or nurses, we have no shortage of Canadian PhDs vying for Canadian academic jobs. As we all know, we have a shortage of academic positions, especially given the current widespread underfunding of our university system.\nIn McGill University’s Department of Anthropology – my doctoral alma mater – only one of the 16 full-time faculty members obtained his PhD in Canada. Its 15 other members all hail from doctoral programs in the United States, including from the University of Chicago, Harvard University, the University of California, Berkeley and Columbia University.\nThe situation at McGill is consistent with an analysis of Canada’s anthropology programs undertaken in 2015 by prominent Canadian anthropologists James Waldram and Janice Graham. Examining recent hiring patterns by focusing only on assistant professorships, they concluded that “two-thirds of Assistant Professors obtained their degrees from U.S. universities, and almost 80 per cent hold PhDs from a non-Canadian program.”\nNo systematic review exists to understand the current extent of the Americanization of Canadian higher education. Systematic analyses are often challenging to conduct, because it can be hard to see the provenance of professors:  Degrees are not always listed on academics’ websites, and CVs are not publicly available.\nHowever, my examination of several academic units at elite Canadian universities revealed results strikingly similar to Waldram and Graham’s conclusions. For example, the University of Toronto’s sociology department is the largest in the country, boasting more than 70 full time tenure-stream positions.  I was able to identify 57 faculty members who received their PhDs from the United States, five of whom had done their undergraduate degrees in Canada. On the other hand, there were only 10 faculty members who had obtained their PhDs in Canada, amounting to less than 15 per cent of the department.\nThe percentage I found at McGill’s sociology department was almost identical, with 16 faculty members holding PhDs from the U.S. (three of whom did their undergrads in Canada) and only three holding Canadian PhDs.\nI found similar results in many other academic units, although I only examined departments in the social sciences and humanities. Additionally, I found that hiring bias does not appear to be universal but more prominent in certain institutions and certain units, reflecting a deference to local culture. Numerous Atlantic Canadian universities, for example, appear to be entirely unaffected by it. Ontario universities appear to be more so. I also did not examine francophone Quebec universities which have their own cultural and linguistic dynamics.\nNevertheless, in examining different academic units and universities, two additionally troubling patterns emerged. First, academics holding Canadian PhDs were often the oldest members of the department, which suggests that hiring patterns have shifted and that Americanization is a more recently dominant trend.  Second, many Canadian PhDs appear to be hired because they work on topics specific to Canada that may have been integral to their job description. In other words, sociologists with Canadian PhDs focus on Canadian society, historians with Canadian PhDs on Canadian history, and political scientists with Canadian PhDs on Canadian politics, leaving world history, political theory, and international relations even more dominated by non-Canadian hires. The only areas that insulated Canadian PhDs from hiring bias were those where it would be hard to find any American candidate with an American PhD.\nMeanwhile, my non-systematic analysis found that while Canadian PhDs were far less represented in tenure-stream jobs, they were far more represented in teaching-stream positions, which generally come with less pay, less prestige and less job security.  In such a way, one could argue that Canadian PhDs are second-class citizens in their own institutions.  In an ironic gap between theory and practice, it appears that the more attuned a discipline is to questions of colonialism, imperialism, neoliberalism, inequality, and hegemony – disciplines like sociology, political science, history, or anthropology – the more likely it is to be dominated by Americans.\nWhat’s jarring about how American PhDs end up being prioritized over Canadians for academic jobs is that many Canadian academic job announcements come with a statement that “Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority.” In practice, this is easily circumvented because priority is trumped by the designation of the most qualified candidate. That is, as it should be, deferred to search committees and academic units. But as departments become more Americanized so do academic search committees, and it is not surprising that hiring bias accelerates and makes one question whether American professors in Canada with American PhDs really give any preference to Canadian PhDs for academic jobs. Certainly, the numbers I found suggest otherwise.\nRead the opposing view: American recruitment in the Canadian academy: The case in favour\nIt’s true that a minority of scholars with American PhDs are Canadian citizens and thus fit within prioritization of citizenship over academic pedigree. However, this still begs the question: Why even bother having PhD programs if we consider Canadian PhDs to be second-rate compared to American ones?   Over the years, I have had numerous conversations with ambitious undergraduates and MA students about applying to doctoral programs, and they invariably ask if they are going to be competitive on the Canadian academic labour market if they stay in Canada for their PhDs. Many do not want to leave but see no choice. They are acutely aware of existing hiring bias. It is sad that so many believe landing an academic position in Canada requires them to leave the country to the United States for a PhD, often taking Canadian scholarship money with them.\nThis is not a nativist argument. I write this as a Canadian citizen invested in this country. I also write this as an American citizen who arrived in this country for graduate school, obtained permanent residency status, and prioritized staying in Canada when I was on the job market. I’m also proud of our higher educational system and never considered my doctoral degree inferior to those of my American peers.\nA good argument exists for hiring scholars trained in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and, yes, the United States to represent a diversity of academic and global perspectives and a variety of intellectual traditions. But the current trend of Americanization of Canadian universities fosters less diversity and more intellectual homogenization. Having pockets of professors trained at the same schools invariably leads to less educational variety and misses out historically on how many major new ideas, scientific innovations, and breakthroughs have come from educational peripheries.\nWhat also gets limited are Canadian perspectives in classrooms while reproducing American culture-war debates that do not always have the same resonance in Canada. Americanization also jeopardizes the future of Canadian academic professional associations and the distinctiveness of, to cite my discipline as an example, Canadian anthropology. While many Americans assimilate to their new home, some keep a foot more firmly planted in the United States. After all, for some, Canada is a second choice after they have been unable to land work at home. Their personal, familial, and academic networks are entirely there.\nEven many of the most highly educated Americans know surprisingly little about Canada, often abstractly seeing it as a socialist paradise or merely a place to threaten to move to when Republicans are elected President.  Upon arrival, despite our not having the same deep inequalities as the United States, they confront our high housing costs and the major issues in our medical and educational systems. Lacking the resources of deep-pocketed American institutions with their huge endowments, expense funds, and subsidized housing, they also may find Canadian universities underfunded by comparison and perhaps less attractive than they had imagined in the abstract. One can cite numerous cases of American academics who come here at the start of their careers and then leave for more prestigious positions back home as quickly as they can.\nTrump’s trade war has unleashed a new nationalist sensibility in Canada and a desire to protect our identity and sovereignty. Maybe we should be applying this to our higher education system.  In the current moment, rather than encouraging more American academics, perhaps we should be better protecting made-in-Canada academic talent. Do Canadian universities have a responsibility to be Canadian?  We protect our media and cultural landscape from Americanization, so why not embrace similar protections in our higher educational system? These are not easy questions, but they need to be posed as the national character and independence of our academic system are in jeopardy.\nAri Gandsman\nAri Gandsman is an associate professor in sociological and anthropological studies at the University of Ottawa.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(9 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Apparently, the American bias that only their top ranked schools produce top scholars has crept north of 49° in some disciplines.\nReply\nTilottama Rajan\nMay 22, 2025 at 9:34 pm\nYou are absolutely right. I saw the change in the first year committees were allowed to consider non Canadians in the first round alongside Canadians. I’ve been told by a senior colleague at Toronto that Americans control hiring committees and hire their own. An ABD from a.US university is better than a Canadian PhD –my student — with an accepted book\nWe should not make this colonialism worse\nReply\nRyan Dunch\nMay 22, 2025 at 10:19 pm\nThe corollary to this is that we need to keep our PhD programs strong in Canadian research universities, in every field in which we employ faculty members. That means faculty renewal, along with investment in and prioritizing of graduate degree studies. Not just in STEM. Not just in the “big three” cities. Yet our provincial governments are not seeing this as a funding priority, and public support for the post-secondary sector is also not robust. How can we rebuild support for post-secondary education as a vital element for Canada to thrive?\nReply\nDre Gabrielle Saint-Yves\nMay 23, 2025 at 7:54 am\nJ’ai trouvé votre article très bien documenté.

However, there is more to consider than where the candidate was trained. In particular, there are many people who originate outside of the US who got their PhDs in the US. This might be an excellent source of scholars with diverse backgrounds, especially as Trump seems determined to equate every person of colour as a “DEI hire”.\nOf course, none of this matters if Canada can’t get its act together regarding housing.\nReply\nFrances Sharom\nMay 23, 2025 at 10:05 am\nThis hiring bias may only be true in the humanities and social sciences. I have been in a STEM department for all of my university career, and we have hired zero Americans during that time period.\nReply\nAndrew Brook\nMay 23, 2025 at 11:18 am\nRe. Recruitment of Americans in the Canadian Academy: The Case Against. There is every difference between luring laid-off American academics to Canada and bringing back some of the many thousand Canadian academics who work in the US because there are few academic jobs in Canada. There is also every difference between having an American PhD and being American. One-quarter of the graduate students at Harvard are, or were, international and it is a good thing, not a bad thing, for many of the the best Canadian graduates to go to a top-tier school in Europe or the US for their PhD work.\nReply\nStephanie\nMay 23, 2025 at 1:33 pm\nWe just published a study looking at hiring in Canadian psychology professors from 2012-2022. We found a significant difference in hiring American trained professors in universities with medical schools vs. comprehensive and undergrad only.  McGill was probably the worst. Zero Canadian trained hired between 2012 and 2022 from our search.\nhttps://psycnet.apa.org/record/2026-12949-001\nReply\nMike Wirth\nMay 28, 2025 at 1:26 pm\nThe problem is in part due to too few academic jobs in Canada. This is in due to the faculty demographics being bias towards older academics. The ages 50-64 make up some 43% of total academics, with another 12% above 65. Those under 40 make up a paltry 15%. This is very telling, and likely the reason why domestic students can’t be bothered with going on to do a PhD – too few jobs in academia (or anywhere else honestly). It’s a lot of time and effort put into a degree that won’t get you a job in academia. So fewer jobs mean that hiring committees tend to gravitate towards those applicants who fit the criteria well, and in reality (especially in STEM), this tends to mean (i) publication record, (ii) previous grants, (iii) PhD graduating university. American scholars tend to fit this criteria well, partially due to better access to grants (until recently). Having said that, I have also noted that sometimes there seems to be a bias in hiring practices with good Canadian candidates often given 2nd-tier “teaching-track” positions. Perhaps we value the contribution of American academe too highly in global higher education? Why do we not hire academics with degrees from more diverse regions of the world? Why do we put so much emphasis on having Phd graduate students when they have so little chance of securing a job in academia?\nReply\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMost popular\n01\nCareer Advice\nAdvice\nSSHRC Insight and Insight Development Grant\n02\nCareer Advice\nPolicy\nThe limits of graduate professional development\n03\nNews\nData vs MAGA\n04\nCareer Advice\nWriting\nTeaching students the connection between writing and thinking\n05\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity News and Careers\nSubscribe\nAD\nAdvertisement\nFlight 302\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity of Ottawa President and Vice Chancellor Marie-Eve Sylvestre\nFeatured Jobs\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Master of Data Analytics)\nUniversity of Niagara Falls Canada\nPsychology - Assistant Professor (Speech-Language Pathology)\nUniversity of Victoria\nVeterinary Medicine - Faculty Position (Large Animal Internal Medicine)\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Cybersecurity)\nUniversity of Regina\nEducation - (2) Assistant or Associate Professors, Teaching Scholars (Educational Leadership)\nWestern University\nView all jobs\nMore from Opinion\nOpinion\nResearch\nCancelling Congress wounds humanities research\nBudget squeeze and logistical complexities leave the century-old conference without a host.\nby\nMichael Holden\nJune 10, 2025\nOpinion\nMental Health\nNo student is an island\nImproving the collective environment benefits students’ mental health.\nby\nJustine Pineault, François Lauzier-Jobin & Martine Shareck\nJune 06, 2025\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\nPrestigious American universities have long exerted a gravitational pull on Canadian academia.\nby\nFrancois Lachapelle and X.

It has frozen or threatened to withhold federal research funding from more than 60 institutions — including Harvard, Columbia and Princeton — unless they dismantle equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) offices, eliminate programs it deems “ideological,” and submit to direct federal oversight of curricula and student organizations.\nAlthough EDI has been the primary target, attacks on other aspects of academic life and research have quickly followed. New federal actions invoking antisemitism, foreign funding “transparency” and climate research oversight have introduced fresh channels of pressure, each carrying the same message: comply, or lose funding. The effects are already visible. Princeton lost $4 million in grants related to climate change research. The University of Michigan preemptively shut down its central equity office and a reproductive-health grant panel. Columbia has yielded to pressure, while Harvard is taking the federal government to court after $8.9 billion in federal contracts were frozen.\nThe consequences extend beyond American citizens and institutions. According to an Associated Press review, more than 1,000 international students at 160 U.S. universities, including The Ohio State University, have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March. Some reportedly lost their status due to their political speech and activity.  Some reportedly lost their status due to their political speech and activity.\nRestrictions are affecting academics abroad as well. Scholars who plan to present research in the United States are being questioned at the border about their political views. In one case, a French scientist was denied entry due to criticism of Trump’s policies posted online. In today’s climate, being a foreign-born academic with an opinion that doesn’t toe the MAGA line can feel like checking every box on a Trump-era watchlist.\nUnderstandably, many scholars are anxious. Some are unsure if they’ll be allowed to return to the U.S. after a research trip abroad or a visit home. Others worry their research funding might disappear with little notice. And some face the very real prospect of deportation to countries where they could be at risk of persecution.\nCanada is already seeing the consequences. Reuters reported a 27 percent increase in U.S. graduate student applicants to the University of British Columbia. Other Canadian universities, including Toronto and Waterloo, have reported spikes in web traffic from the United States. The Financial Times recently noted that several prominent academics, including Yale professors Jason Stanley, Marci Shore and Timothy Snyder, are relocating to Canada.\nSome Canadian institutions have begun to respond. UBC has temporarily reopened graduate admissions and introduced a fast-track process for American students facing disruptions.\nFaculty members across the country are stepping up — reviewing application materials, waiving language tests and circulating emergency funding opportunities. These are meaningful efforts, but without broader coordination, they remain piecemeal.\nWhat’s needed now is a national strategy. Canada should establish a clearing house for transfer procedures and immigration guidance; offer emergency fellowships to students and postdocs whose funding has evaporated; negotiate tuition waivers and credit-transfer agreements with American universities to keep academic progress on track; provide assistance with relocation logistics; and build partnerships to connect displaced scholars with Canadian researchers, preserving research collaborations that might otherwise collapse.\nOrganizations like Universities Canada, the Canadian Association of University Teachers, and the Tri-Council funding agencies could take the lead. Academic associations, such as the Canadian Political Science Association, could offer field-specific mentorship.\nSome might ask: why should Canada act, especially given Trump’s attack on Canadian sovereignty? Two reasons stand out — one moral, and one strategic.\nFirst, there is a moral argument. Academic freedom is not the exclusive domain of any one country. When it comes under threat, it is incumbent on the broader scholarly community to respond. Canadian universities pride themselves on their international outlook. This is a moment to demonstrate that commitment — not just by welcoming researchers fleeing repression in distant countries, but by supporting those targeted by political crackdowns in the United States.\nRead the opposing view: American recruitment in the Canadian academy: The case against\nSecond, there is a pragmatic case. The United States has historically been a magnet for research talent. If leading scholars no longer feel secure working there, Canada stands to benefit — particularly as the federal government seeks to grow its innovation and research sectors. Canada could attract highly skilled academics at a time when its own universities face increasing global competition for top talent.\nBut time is short. In some cases, funding freezes arrive at university departments with 30 days’ notice. Visa cancellations come with none. For those affected, decisions must be made quickly — often with families, research agendas and entire careers on the line.\nI write this as someone who owes a great deal to Canada. I completed my master’s degree at McGill University and earned my PhD at the University of British Columbia. My graduate and postdoctoral research were supported by Canadian taxpayers through SSHRC grants. Canada is where I became a scholar, and I remain deeply grateful.\nCanadian universities have a strong global reputation. Now is the time to match that reputation with action. By stepping up, Canadian institutions can send a clear message: that academic freedom matters — and that those forced to choose between their conscience and their career will find a place, and a future, in Canada.\nDominik Stecuła\nDominik Stecuła, PhD is an assistant professor of communication at The Ohio State University.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Neuroinclusive policies and practices can promote student retention and success, says the report, but they need to be integrated and centralized.\nCreating Inclusive Campuses: Neuroinclusive Policies and Practices in Post-Secondary Education examines the experiences of neurodivergent students in Canadian postsecondary education and provides recommendations for how institutions can improve neuroinclusion on their campuses. “There’s a need to focus on individuals but we also need system change,” said Jennifer Fane, lead research associate with The Conference Board of Canada and the report author. There has been an increase in inclusive pathways into postsecondary and institutions are offering accommodations but “there are these persistent barriers that students are encountering,” she said.\nThe report draws on the first national survey of neurodiversity in Canadian postsecondary education, which invited students who identify as neurodivergent (either due to a formal diagnosis or self-identification) to participate. Neurodivergence is a non-medical term that typically encompasses conditions such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities and other neurological differences. The survey included 400 neurodivergent postsecondary students and recent graduates, as well as 78 interviews with neurodivergent students, recent graduates and staff and leaders working in accessibility services. The report is the second in a series, following a November 2024 report on the quantitative survey data.\nThe more than half of responding students who reported not disclosing their identities or diagnoses to their institution cited barriers that include challenges with diagnosis, disclosure and registration, inflexible processes and timelines, and fears of stigma and discrimination. Implementing mandatory neurodiversity training for all campus employees and integration of accessibility into institutional equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) strategic planning and policy development top the report’s recommendations. “All Canadian institutions are focused on EDI,” said Dr. Fane, but “it really has not included people with disabilities and neurodivergent individuals”. The report found that staff and leaders who reported neurodiversity was adequately being addressed in their institutions indicated that there had been a focus on accessibility within policies. The institutions had expanded the traditional EDI framework to EDI-A (equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility) or IDEA (inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility). Integrating accessibility into EDI would also provide a focus on measuring impact and growth, said Dr. Fane – a component that is currently lacking.\nIt is estimated that anywhere from 10 to 20 per cent of the population is neurodivergent, but there is no clear data on the number of neurodivergent students in Canadian higher education. This “huge gap” in data is what makes the report important, said Carly McMorris, associate professor at the University of Calgary and a member of the project’s research advisory committee. “This report is really highlighting the need across neurodivergent areas,” said Dr. McMorris. “Although I’m very focused on supporting individual needs,” she said, “I also recognize how our campuses are not neuroinclusive, meaning that it’s not just up to the neurodivergent person to be able to survive in postsecondary, but rather it’s up to neurotypical folks to provide an environment that’s neuroinclusive.”\n“This is a group that is in high need of support and it hasn’t been something that institutionally, I think, across Canada has been recognized,” said Dr. McMorris. She said that the report’s recommendations around the need for wraparound services, training for faculty and staff and establishment of low-sensory spaces could help students thrive. This report “is probably one of the most influential policy pieces that will move things forward in this field,” she said.\nWhile the report provides actionable items, Dr. Fane recognized that this is happening at a time when many postsecondary institutions are struggling financially. In their interviews, they talked to 30 accessibility services across Canadian colleges, polytechnics and universities, and all reported growth in the number of students accessing services. “They’re not really able to expand services to meet the needs that actually exist in the population without a really different view on it.”\nDr. Fane said that the University of Calgary has been a “standout” in this area with their Neurodiversity Support Office which provides an example of how services can be centralized and integrated. Another example is Kwantlen Polytechnic University’s All Citizens Pathway. Spearheaded by Fiona Whittington-Walsh, professor of sociology and lead advisor on disability, accessibility and inclusion at KPU, the program integrates students with intellectual and/or learning disabilities into undergraduate, for-credit classes. Instead of individual accommodations, courses are designed to be inclusive and accessible. “Everybody in the class has access to the same supports,” said Dr. Whittington-Walsh. “They do not need to get any kind of academic accommodations because the philosophy is that we build all of this accessible design into our teaching and into our practice.” Based on the foundation of Universal Design for Learning principles, the program uses what Dr. Whittington-Walsh calls “critical disability pedagogy”.\n“There are lots of examples of great practice and more and more I am seeing really game-changing things happen, but the progress is just really slow,” said Dr. Fane. “What the research has tried to do is make sure that individuals know more about how they can navigate the system better, the types of evidence-based strategies that might work, but then we also just need the systems to do their jobs so that the individuals are having more success with those strategies.”\nOther recommendations in the report include:\nAddress misconceptions about accommodations among faculty members through training on legal obligations, standardized processes, guidance and a formal process to address instances where a student’s right to accommodations is not being upheld.\nInclude neurodivergent students, staff and faculty in policy-making to enhance institutional neuroinclusivity.\nCentralize neurodiversity supports to ensure coordinated access to accessibility services, mental health services, support programs and other services.\nProvide neurodivergent students with targeted information relevant to their learning and cognitive profiles, as well as available services and supports, to help them develop their self‑advocacy skills.\nIncrease flexibility in institutional processes, including early access to course details and lengthened drop/withdrawal timelines, so that students can make informed decisions about course suitability.\nSet measurable outcomes to track progress and ensure accountability.\nSparrow McGowan\nSparrow McGowan is a freelance journalist, writer and editor based in Ottawa.\nTags\nNeurodiversity\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

But despite interest from certain students, no French-language university in Quebec has signed on\nIn an ideal meritocracy, a person’s skills would be enough to progress their career. The Scarborough Charter is the result of a series of nationwide inter-institutional consultations to eliminate inequalities disadvantaging people of African descent in higher education.\nParticipating universities have customized the action plan set out in the 20-page document with the goal of identifying and dismantling discriminatory barriers in their institution on an ongoing basis. By signing the charter, universities join a coalition in which participants analyze collected data and share insights to advance the inclusion of Black staff and students on campus.\nAfter learning about the charter, Sarah Vuka Makani, president of the independent Organisation des étudiant.e.s noir.e.s de l’Université de Montréal (Organization of Black students at Université de Montréal—ODENUM), said she was hurt that Université de Montréal (UdeM) had not signed it.\nUniversities have a “duty to protect” all students, she said. “It’s as though they’re sweeping [anti-Black racism] under the rug and saying we’ll deal with it later. But the real question is when exactly is ‘later’?”\nEquity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) measures on campus and in society at large have helped Ms. Vuka Makani deepen her own understanding of structural inequalities.  Microaggressions, discrimination, everyday and color-blind racism, misunderstandings, and (un)conscious biases are “a lot to process,” said Ms. Vuka Makani.  “It’s a constant feeling of insecurity,” she added. “Sometimes it’s not until later that we realize [we’ve experienced racism].” And while this can stir up painful emotions, it also strengthens her commitment to her organization.\nAs someone committed to defending Black students’ interests between student duties, she believes the refusal to adopt the Scarborough Charter penalizes her community.\n“Recognizing anti-Black racism entails making a commitment,” argued Myrlande Pierre, vice president of Quebec’s commission for human rights and youth rights. Though the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms identifies all human beings as equal, Ms. Pierre points out that some groups still experience various forms of discrimination across civil society.\nIn Quebec, Premier François Legault continues to deny the existence of systemic racism and has rejected several reports finding that Black people are racially profiled across public, professional, educational and medical spheres. This denial has notably been denounced by Amnesty International (French only).\nA French-language survey conducted this spring by the research firm Léger and the Observatoire des communautés noires du Québec (Observatory on Quebec’s Black Community) revealed that 66 per cent of Black people between the ages of 15 and 34 report having been treated unfairly by provincial and federal public services. Meanwhile, only 19 per cent of non-Black youth reported the same experience.\nIs EDI just an idea ?\nQuebec’s English-language universities, Bishop’s Concordia and McGill, signed the Scarborough Charter when it was introduced. French-language universities have yet to do so. The lack of institutional transparency troubles Ms. Vuka Makani. No matter what universities ultimately decide, she thinks they could at least notify students.\nUniversité Laval (ULaval), Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue (UQAT), and HEC Montréal agreed to speak with University Affairs about their reasoning behind not adopting the charter.\nThough these institutions share the charter’s values, their representatives acknowledged that recognizing anti-Black racism through the charter poses other challenges. The relatively low Black student population at UQAT—about 400, or 10 per cent—and the budget committed to Indigenous reconciliation has limited the institution’s positive response to the charter.\nUQAT president Vincent Rousson said the university chose not to sign the anti-racism charter because its implementation would have required significant additional resources and created overlapping policy structures. Instead, the institution opted for a more holistic and regionally grounded approach to EDI—one that includes strong commitments to Indigenous communities.\n“We had already made collective decisions with our regional partners, including First Nations,” Dr. Rousson explained. “Implementing the charter would have forced us to divert resources away from those priorities.”\n“At a certain point, choosing one thing means giving up another,” he added, noting that limited budgets require difficult decisions.\nULaval, which has about 1,500 Black students, or 25 per cent of its student population, was in the early stages of creating its EDI policy as the charter was being created. Committing to another long-term project at that stage would have been “very restrictive,” said ULaval’s EDI officer François Gélineau.\nAll three universities have developed custom internal EDI action plans to foster respectful intercultural relations and eliminate racism, injustice and discrimination. But EDI advocates say these general policies often fail to clearly acknowledge the implicit nature or severity of the discrimination levied against people with certain attributes or from certain ethnic origins, or the complexity of their intersectionality.\n“We take sexual assault very seriously and have held mini workshops on the subject,” noted Ms. Vuka Makani. “It would be nice to hold workshops about racism, too.”\nIn Montreal, HEC Director Federico Pasin said he is “ambivalent” about adopting some of the actions suggested in the charter for fear of allegations of favoritism toward Black people at the expense of other minority groups. Mr. Pasin, who was not aware of the Scarborough Charter before being contacted for an interview, said he finds the data aspect of the charter compelling.\n“People have biases. People of color are disadvantaged as a result. But are Black people really more disadvantaged than others?” he voiced during the interview.\nThe inequalities experienced by people of African descent are not unique to Quebec or Canada, Ms. Pierre pointed out. Anti-Black racism is a common historical legacy of colonialism that generates both intentional and unintentional stereotypes “still very much alive in the collective imagination.”\nEven “talking about anti-Black racism is not something everybody wants to do,” said Ms. Vuka Makani. “It’s uncomfortable. But sometimes discomfort wakes people up and triggers change.”\n*Editor’s note: When University Affairs reached out to Université de Sherbrooke, École de technologie supérieure, Université du Québec à Montréal, Université de Montréal, and Polytechnique Montréal, they directed us to their EDI practices.

We are not keeping up with other countries, particularly the United States, our largest trading partner. We are at risk of falling further behind as the global economy is upended by the U.S. focus on growing its own domestic manufacturing and technology industries through subsidies, tariffs and reshoring initiatives.\n“Elbows Up” may be a good slogan for an adrenaline rush. However, if we fail to turn this period of adversity into a long-term advantage, the economic impact to our country will be felt by generations to come. We require a bolder, integrated strategy involving governments, industries, and our world-class universities that attract and develop top talent.\nFirst, Canada needs a more tech-savvy workforce, which means training more people in artificial intelligence, data science, and other advanced skills. One of Canada’s greatest weaknesses is that businesses are slow to adopt AI, automation and cloud-based systems, not due to lack of awareness but because they do not have enough skilled workers to use and leverage these tools. We know what we must do, but not how – universities as partners is an answer.\nThe Vector Institute’s 2024 report on emerging AI skills identifies a pressing need for workers with specialized expertise in areas such as machine learning, data engineering and cybersecurity. Digital literacy needs to be a core skill for students at all educational levels, from K-12 and throughout higher education. Industries should be involved in developing curriculums and offering real-world learning opportunities. In today’s economy, we do not just need more people who can write code, we need people who can understand the societal implications of AI, who can design ethical business models, who communicate across sectors, who can connect insights from science and the humanities into solutions. That is what a university education, done right, is built for.\nWe need to broaden our definition of “tech-savvy” so that students and workers can use technology effectively. Humanities, critical thinking and analytical writing skills need to be integrated into tech training to solve the big problems of today and tomorrow.\nSecondly, our universities and industries need to collaborate in areas where Canada has an advantage: critical minerals, the Arctic economy, foreign policy, AI, agrifood, aerospace and clean energy, all come to mind. But above all we need to remember that we are a knowledge-based economy. We must build partnerships that help students gain practical experience and access new ideas. In other countries such as Germany and South Korea, schools and industries work seamlessly to turn research into real-world solutions and drive commercialization. Canada’s postsecondary institutions can do more to break out of our silos.\nEncouragingly, new models – beyond internships – are emerging. The University of Ottawa’s CloudCampus, launched in partnership with the Bell Canada company FX Innovation and CENGN (Canada’s Centre of Excellence in Next Generation Networks), offers graduate training in building cloud systems and retraining opportunities for mid-career professionals. The Creative Destruction Lab, founded at the University of Toronto and now operating at 12 sites around the world, is a global startup program for science-based companies looking for initial funding. At Victoria University, the Centre for Creativity convenes business, academic and creative industry thinkers to find answers to specific questions together.\nCanadian universities can and should lead the way in creating more of these partnerships. With their research capacity, teaching talent and deep community networks, they are uniquely positioned to build bridges between innovation and implementation. Where else in society can you find such deep and broad expertise in one place: scientists, engineers, artists, historians, ethicists, and economics, for example, all working side by side? This diversity of knowledge and perspective is the value universities bring to the table and which will be critical to solving today’s most complex challenges.\nThirdly, government support is vital. Canada must create a culture where innovation is not just fostered, but expected, both in classrooms and board rooms. Tax incentives, matching grants and streamlined funding applications can encourage more businesses to invest in collaborative research and development.\nUnless Canada modernizes its productivity strategy, we risk long-term economic stagnation. But if we can better connect education, industry and research, we will not only catch up with other economies but also create a stronger, more competitive future. It’s time to get our elbows up and all hands in — rolling up our sleeves not just to work hard, but to translate that work into building a strong, resilient economy for everyone.\nRhonda McEwen\nRhonda McEwen is the President of Victoria University in the University of Toronto and Canada Research Chair in Tactile Interface, Communication and Cognition\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Photo by: THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n1 Comments\nThe Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Mark Carney secured a fourth term in Monday’s election, bringing clarity to leaders in the postsecondary sector looking to chart a productive path forward with the new government.\nWhile higher education remained a backseat issue in an election dominated by the ongoing trade war imposed by U.S. president Donald Trump and the dual crises of housing and affordability, the Liberals have made promises with significant impact for universities\nChief among them is a $10 billion investment in building new homes, with $2 billion dedicated to student and senior housing. The new government further promises to invest in attracting leading researchers to Canadian institutions and to create a capstone organization for federal research funding to enable mission-driven research.\nGabriel Miller, president and CEO of Universities Canada (publisher of University Affairs) said his organization is eager to work with the new government to ensure it delivers on its commitments. Investments in student housing and strengthening Canada’s research ecosystem are welcome news, but he said the leading priority for the university sector is the urgent need to fix Canada’s immigration system.\n“It’s crucial that we sit down quickly with this government and restore confidence in Canada’s immigration system, because right now we’re losing people we’re going to desperately need to drive the economy,” said Mr. Miller.\nUniversities Canada, which represents 97 Canadian universities, will also be working to ensure ongoing promises by the previous Liberal government under Justin Trudeau are fulfilled. Central to those promises is a major injection of $1.8 billion in federal research grants of which 12 per cent has been disbursed since it was first announced in 2024.\nChad Gaffield, executive director of the U15, said that Canada’s leading research universities are ready to partner with the new government and that the prime minister’s election “comes at a time of real urgency to strengthen Canada as a resilient, secure and sovereign country.”\nFor many in the academic community, the new government has brought a sense of relief. Glen Jones, a professor of higher education at the University of Toronto, noted that the Conservative Party, which will remain as official opposition to a minority Liberal government, had been causing concerns with its rhetoric around “woke ideology” which could have implications for equity, diversity and inclusion policies and programs.\n“But more importantly, there were references to monitoring research activities and perhaps getting involved in interventions that would have direct implications for the autonomy of institutions and for academic freedom,” said Dr. Jones. “So I think there’s a sigh of relief about that policy platform and where it was going in terms of moving forward.”\nLinking postsecondary education to economic growth\nPostsecondary leaders communicated a sense of urgency to get to work with the new government as well as the importance of continuing conversations with policymakers from across the political spectrum.\n“We look forward to collaborating with the new government and with members from all parties to continue advancing education, research and innovation as pillars of Canada’s prosperity and leadership,” said Deep Saini, chair of Universities Canada and president and vice-chancellor of McGill University.\nThe election of the Liberal Party comes at an uncertain time for Canada and the global economy. Prime Minister Carney intends to eliminate trade barriers between the provinces and territories and build the “fastest growing economy in the G7,” among other ambitions. Postsecondary leaders say universities will be fundamental to driving that growth, and recognize they will need to move quickly to communicate to policymakers and the public how they can contribute to the Canadian economy.\n“It’s a critical time for us to show just how much we’re going to contribute to helping the country weather this storm and thrive in the long run,” said Mr. Miller.\nInternational education remains most pressing issue\nPrime Minister Carney has said he will maintain immigration levels, including caps imposed on international student visas first imposed by the Trudeau administration in January 2024. The policy change took the postsecondary sector by surprise leading to declining enrolment and severely reducing a major source of tuition revenue for universities.\n“At this point, the universities and colleges are far below the caps. In other words, there’s something about the brand of international education in Canada that has been negatively impacted by those 2024 decisions – and that’s bad for everyone,” said Dr. Jones.\nPrime Minister Carney has promised to invest $100 million over four years to attract leading researchers who have had their funding cut by the U.S. government. But Mr. Miller says more needs to be done – and soon.\n“The single area we have to make the most rapid changes in is our system for welcoming international researchers and students, which is too slow, too bureaucratic and simply not good enough to compete internationally,” he said.\nPrioritizing research and innovation\nBesides the incoming government’s promise of a $46 million investment into Canada’s AI institutions, research and innovation barely factored into the election. “We’re going through some sort of major economic transition, and research and innovation need to be in that same conversation,” said Dr. Jones.\nAccording to the OECD, Canada ranks the highest in public research and development investment but among the lowest in innovation outcomes such as technology adoption and, importantly, productivity growth – which is how countries raise citizens’ standards of living.\nPostsecondary leaders are pushing for a a more holistic conversation surrounding research and innovation.\n“It really starts by sitting down with everybody, with entrepreneurs, with Canadian businesses, with government, with universities, and asking ourselves how we make sure the benefits of our research to Canadians are maximized and amplified,” said Mr. Miller.\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

International students were also impacted, with their minimum tuition set to $20,000.\nIn his decision, Judge Dufour said the ministry failed to provide data supporting its assertion that out-of-province students were not integrating into Quebec society. The current fee structure will be maintained, however, with the ministry given a nine-month window to make amendments.\nThe French language requirement was invalidated immediately “given the near-certain impossibility of achievement,” according to the ruling.\nIncreases to international student tuition will remain unchanged. Judge Dufour deemed it reasonable for the province to want to balance funding between French and English universities as the latter attract more international students who pay higher tuition.\nHigher Education Minister Pascale Dery’s office did not respond to comment at the time of writing. The ministry has 30 days to appeal the decision.\nPhoto courtesy of: Concordia University\nMcGill, Concordia universities react to ruling\nThe regulations had followed months of negotiations between the English-speaking institutions and the province to find an agreement. By August of 2024, Concordia reported that the university’s out of province enrolment had dropped by 28 per cent.\n“Although I find little satisfaction in today’s decision – we were left no option but to challenge the government’s policies on legal grounds – I am reassured by the court’s findings,” said President and Vice-Chancellor Graham Carr in a memo to Concordia’s community members.\nThe president wrote that the university would continue to analyze the impact of the ruling on English-speaking institutions and the Quebec university network. He also reiterated Concordia’s “ongoing commitment to supporting our students’ efforts to achieve French-language proficiency.”\nA similar message was sent to the McGill community by President and Vice-Chancellor Deep Saini. McGill kept enrolment relatively stable – a drop of only 8 per cent in 2024 – by admitting more Quebec students and introducing a new scholarship to offset out-of-province tuition hikes.\n“McGill University remains firmly committed to playing an essential role in Quebec’s economy, talent pipeline, research ecosystem and to contributing to the promotion and validity of the French language,” wrote Dr. Saini.\nEtienne Paré, president of the Quebec Student Union, said he is not surprised by the decision and that the mandates had sent the wrong message about studying in Quebec.\n“The judge mostly said what we have been saying for a year-and-a-half, that the tuition hike made no sense,” he said. “The government is not sending the right message to people – if you want them to integrate more, if you want them to learn French, if you want them to become a part of Quebec society, this isn’t the way to do so.”\nMr. Paré said his union continues to oppose the tuition minimum for international students. “It’s not normal that we use international students to compensate for us because the government doesn’t invest in our universities.”\nHannah Liddle & Mohamed Berrada\nTags\nConcordia\nEnrolment\nMcGill\nPascale Déry\nPolicy\nQuebec\nQuébec\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Why do you think this is taking place?\nThere are direct political attacks south of the border on equity, diversity and inclusion, or DEI in the U.S. We are seeing the political wind shift in Canada, too. I suspect some of our institutions are looking at how to confront this wave of authoritarian populism, ethnonationalism, or whatever you want to call it, so that we are not targets.\nThis has become a political power play in some ways, and the more cynical side of me recognizes that it’s a great fundraising tool for some political parties and that people write cheques on this issue – and that helps them.\nWhat critiques of EDI do you hear from your members?\nThere has been a tendency in some circles, under the broad umbrella of EDI, to call people out more than calling people in – so there is a kernel of truth to the notions of censorship or cancel culture. But I want to emphasize that these cases are rare.\nA point I hear often is that institutions have a surface-level approach to EDI – that it was about representation instead of changing the whole culture. It also became a very bureaucratic process.\nAnother concern is that we have an increasing number of precarious contract employees who were left out of the EDI conversation. That is a serious equity issue as well.\nWhat is your perspective on the position that EDI is at odds with ‘excellence’?\nI’m told by EDI critics that excellence should be the major decision-making factor for jobs, research funding and so on. When you take that argument to the extreme, they’re saying that in a perfect world we would have a professoriate that would mirror the general population or pipeline of graduate students. We would have research that would be funded across a whole range of issues. The fact that we don’t, according to this logic, seems to suggest they are arguing that certain groups aren’t excellent. I don’t buy that argument.\nIs there merit to the argument that EDI stifles debate on campuses?\nI know some argue that conservative voices are disproportionately absent within universities and colleges, but we should look seriously at our campuses – because I see a lot of diversity. When I have meetings with members, they certainly let me know that there’s a wide range of views across the political spectrum. I don’t see any real evidence that EDI has stifled any debate. It seems to me that there is robust debate going on.\nShould those working in positions to advance EDI be worried?\nPeople are nervous. But I am also a bit more optimistic in the sense that we have stronger institutions in Canada.\nEven though it has become politicized here, it doesn’t have the same vitriolic attention as the U.S., so I hope that there’s strong resilience here in Canada to push back against the counter offensive. If we step backwards, it will be less inclusive, less diverse and less equitable.\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nTags\nEDI\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

It’s an “historic” milestone, said Denis Gros-Louis, Director General of the FNEC. This partnership strives to offer specially adapted university programs to Indigenous students. A business plan for the House of Knowledge will be submitted to Quebec’s department of higher education by 2027. “All Quebec’s universities were interested in partnering and contributing knowledge to the new institution from day one,” said Mr. Gros-Louis.\nGhislain Picard, former chief of the Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador, noted in a statement: “The House of Knowledge is the result of the tenacity of communities to reaffirm their self-determination in education. It responds to a real need and will contribute to the trend of an increasing number of First Nations graduates observed in recent years. This project embodies the shared vision of First Nations to fully claim control over their education. Fifty years after the national policy ‘Indian Control of Indian Education,’ I am delighted to see this initiative take shape.”\nThe project aims to address educational deficits among Indigenous Peoples by improving graduation rates and increasing the number of qualified teachers.\nBuilding on the Regional Education Agreement\nIn July 2022, the FNEC signed a historic funding agreement with the federal government to address funding deficits for Indigenous schools that dated from 1996. “As our youth become more active and engaged, we noticed that our graduation rates were a bit behind,” noted Mr. Gros-Louis. “Our chiefs concluded it was time we ran our own higher education network.”\nFNEC is using its Kiuna Institution as a learning hub while they work on establishing research chairs and attracting experts over the coming years. As academic success rates rise among Indigenous students, the need for an entirely Indigenous university is more pressing than ever.  “The goal is to make university education accessible to First Nations students, whether in urban or remote communities, by benefitting from experiences of Quebec universities,” says Mr. Gros-Louis.\nThe First Nations university will be created in several stages based on three priorities identified by First Nations Regional Chiefs. The first is to quickly prepare students to enter the workforce, which requires the institution’s financial needs to be met within the first 18 months. The second and third are to align the university with First Nations values and traditions and consider how best to root it in their cultures.\nA survey is currently underway to identify the specific needs of individual communities, especially where workforce and training are concerned. Regional Chiefs are tasked with making decisions based on the anticipated knowledge and workforce requirements of the next 15 years.  “Healthcare and education are themes that often come up,” explained Mr. Gros-Louis, “as do language and culture. I also hear more and more about using and modernizing traditional knowledge to achieve food self-sufficiency and reduce remote regions’ dependence on the biofood industry.”\nThe plan also anticipates partnering with the Regroupement des centres d’amitié autochtones du Québec (Native Friendship Centres of Quebec). This association will play an important role in the project, especially in orienting First Nations students to university life and contributing to logistics and support, including housing and student well-being.\nAlthough the institutional board will be comprised of First Nations members with the aim of meeting the needs of Indigenous Peoples, the House of Knowledge will be open to all. In the 2000s, Mr. Gros-Louis also contributed to the creation of First Nations University of Canada in Saskatchewan where he managed the federal Indian land registry. Though he wasn’t present at its inauguration, he has visited it many times and followed the project closely. He noted that Saskatchewan’s example can inspire, but that First Nations in Quebec have totally different needs. “The project’s business plan has to be approved by the government,” he added. “Reports will be sent every six months to keep the Ministry informed and involved. The project is progressing well. We hope to have a concrete opening date very soon.”\nMarie-Lou Bernatchez\nMarie-Lou Bernatchez is a francophone journalist at University Affairs.\nTags\nFirst Nations\nPremières Nations\nQuébec\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.
