But in today’s universities, an increasing number of scholars find themselves trapped in precarious, low-paid sessional contracts – far from the secure careers they once envisioned.\nIn this episode of The Academic Issue, Dr. Jamie Paris joins Kate to discuss the systemic issues behind unstable employment in academia, drawing from his article The Exploitation Trap of Hope Labour. We explore the emotional and financial toll of “hope labour” and why universities continue to rely on precarious workers – but is real change possible?\nShow more\nShow less\nEpisode 2\nAI and Academia\nGuest\nMark Daley\nListening options:\nListen on Spotify\nListen on Apple Podcasts\nListen on Amazon Music\nListen on iHeart Podcasts\nListen on Podchaser\nListen on Podbean\nGenerative AI tools like Chat GPT have already sent shockwaves through the academic world, raising complex questions about academic integrity and the nature of learning.

Since President Donald Trump’s election in November 2024, they had been duplicating government web pages, interactive tools and datasets in case the new administration decided to change, delete or irretrievably conceal them.\nBy the end of January, about 2,000 pages had gone missing from the total inventory of about 310,000 pages on U.S. federal government websites. “That’s 2,000 missed opportunities; 2,000 things that people won’t find there anymore,” says Eric Nost, associate professor of geography, environment and geomatics at the University of Guelph.\nThen, in a January 20 order, the U.S. government directed all federal agencies to acknowledge only two biological sexes and to “remove all … internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.” Information such as the results of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey were taken down — although that particular page was later restored after a court order, with a disclaimer stating that the administration rejects its contents.\nIt’s normal for government digital materials to change as they are revised or become redundant. When new governments come in, more rewrites and deletions happen, often reflecting the agenda of the administration. “The surprising thing here has been the scope and speed of these changes,” says Dr. Nost.\nDr. Nost works with the U.S.-based Environmental Data and Governance Initiative (EDGI), a group formed in 2016 during the first Trump administration whose mission includes safeguarding vulnerable environmental data. “We saw fairly significant efforts to change website language and the way issues such as climate change and energy were described,” Dr. Nost says of President Trump’s first term, adding that datasets were largely left untouched at that time. “This time around, the scope of changes is much wider.”\nRecently, Dr. Nost has been duplicating interactive tools used to access datasets, including the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, which was taken down on January 22. He helped recreate the interactive map and repost it on the site of a climate group.\nWhile Dr. Nost is Canadian and the data is American, it’s hugely important to him and to his colleagues. “The U.S. federal government is the world’s largest publisher of information,” he says. Kristi Thompson, research data management librarian at Western University, noted, “People go to their data because they have great, detailed data sets. A lot of Canadian research and worldwide research is based on those sets.”\nConcerns in Canada\nMs. Thompson is part of group of about 50 people with the newly hatched Canadian Data Rescue Project, which is backing up minor government department sites. “There is a clear assault on public data and public knowledge going on in the United States,” she says. “If you destroy the trust in public data collection, that’s significant. And I’m concerned the same thing could happen in Canada.”\nPrior to the Canadian federal election in April 2025, Katie Cuyler, open publishing and government information librarian at the University of Alberta, was doing her part to safeguard information as part of the End of Session Archive conducted by Internet Archive Canada. “The vibe is chaotic and uncertain,” she said of that time.\nEstablished in 2004, Internet Archives Canada is affiliated with California-based Internet Archive, which digitizes books and preserves old versions of websites on its Wayback Machine. One of the first digital preservation initiatives, the Internet Archive dates to 1996, when the Internet itself was growing and becoming increasingly accessible. Like newspapers, the content published on the web was ephemeral — but unlike newspapers, no one was saving it.\nMore groups and projects started in 2008, with elections on both sides of the Canada-U.S. border in a digital era. Libraries, which used to keep paper copies of government documents, had begun making virtual backups. In the U.S. the End of Term Web Archive launched, while Internet Archive Canada began backing up government data.\nIn 2010, Prime Minister Stephen Harper’s Conservative government abolished the long-form census. In 2012, it defunded of the First Nations Statistical Institute and closed a slew of federal government libraries. In response, a group of committed library professionals launched the Canadian Government Information Digital Preservation Network (CGI-DPN). “What happened in 2012 really lit a fire,” says Ms. Cuyler.\nFinding better ways to save\nThere are a dizzying number of groups and projects tackling the preservation of vast amounts of tough-to-track information. “What’s freaky about datasets is when they’re gone, they’re just gone. You’re relying on other things to know they even existed,” says Ms. Thompson.\nNow, those doing this work are seeking to improve their protocols. “While the data does not go away, it becomes harder to access,” says Matt Price, assistant professor of history at the University of Toronto, who works with EDGI. “We’ve had initiatives to back up dataset but nobody ever used the data. It was like we took the family inheritance and put it into big glass jars and buried it in the backyard.”\nThere’s a push to establish common repositories and to ensure that academics, librarians, students and the public know where to find them. The Wayback Machine is well-known, and librarians are promoting the repository Borealis, a partnership of numerous university libraries hosted at U of T, which contains materials such as agricultural and environmental datasets.\nAs well, saved information needs care over time, says Andrea Mills, executive director, Internet Archive Canada. “Some of the government documents that we have digitized are almost 20 years. We have to go back and do the optical character recognition over again, improving formats and leveraging new technology.”\nBig tech risks\nDr. Price struggles with storing materials on cloud platforms run by tech giants such as Google and Amazon Web Services, some of which offer in-kind donations to U.S. data-backup groups. According to CNN, Amazon and Google each donated $1 million to President Trump’s inaugural fund. “I think we should be careful. We should recognize that we are entrusting important work to untrustworthy actors,” Dr. Price says.\nIn a perfect world, Canada would collect more of its own data, and the safety of evidence-based materials would be carefully protected here and elsewhere. For now, there’s backing up, coding, collaborating and hoping for the best. “This is a stressful time,” says Ms. Cuyler, “and a reminder that democracy takes a lot of work.”\nDiane Peters\nDiane Peters is a Toronto-based writer and editor.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

It propelled the career of neuroscientist Donna Rose Addis, leading her to win the 2010 Prime Minister’s MacDiarmid Emerging Scientist Prize in her home country of New Zealand.\nDr. Addis currently leads the Memory Lab at the Rotman Research Institute, Baycrest, which is affiliated with the University of Toronto (U of T). There, a team of researchers is studying memory, identity and — of particular importance for Canada’s senescent population — the aging brain. She is one of the two dozen renowned scholars supported by the Canada 150 Research Chairs Program.\nLaunched eight years ago to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Confederation, the program provided a one-time investment of $117.6 million to Canadian universities to attract top-tier, internationally based scholars.\nDonna Rose Addis, C150 Research Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience of Memory and Aging. © Rachel Wong, Baycrest\nTwenty of the C150 Research Chairs are still active, engaged in research in the social sciences and humanities; natural sciences and engineering; and health and life sciences. However, the program is sunsetting this year — at a dramatic time for Canada and the world.\nTo rank the accomplishments of the chairs would be a monumental task, and for Ted Hewitt, president of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC), beside the point.  “The aim was to attract people who were leading edge in their field, no matter where they happen to be, to come to Canada and create research hubs or centres,” he said.\nThe lab of Alàn Aspuru-Guzik, a C150 Research Chair in Theoretical Chemistry, provides a compelling example of such a research hub. A pioneer in the use of AI for chemical and materials applications, Dr. Aspuru-Guzik has brought in more than $20 million and grown his lab to include more than 40 highly qualified personnel since. “It’s not that I recruited them — they came, because it’s a movement,” said Dr. Aspuru-Guzik, who also holds a CIFAR AI Chair at the Vector Institute at U of T, one of Canada’s three AI institutes. “We want to make Canada, but also Toronto in particular, the leader in AI for materials.”\nFormerly at Harvard University, Dr. Aspuru-Guzik said choosing Canada made sense, not only for his research ambitions but because he was worried about the societal impacts when Donald Trump was first elected U.S. president in 2016. “I believe in democracy and justice, and when Trump gets elected — and I am Jewish, Mexican — I get really worried about how Trump is going to behave.”\nDr. Aspuru-Guzik is one of many scholars who accepted a C150 Research Chair in part because of the global geopolitical climate at the time the program debuted. Several others, such as Jennifer Welsh, an international affairs expert, were motivated by the shocking announcement that the United Kingdom was leaving the European Union after the 2016 Brexit referendum.  A renowned political scientist who served as special adviser to former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Dr. Welsh joined McGill University as the Canada 150 Research Chair in Global Governance and Society as it was preparing to launch the Max Bell School of Public Policy. “The chance to be part of building up something new at McGill was really interesting to me,” she said.\nJennifer Welsh, Canada 150 Research Chair in Global Governance and Society. © Owen Egan and Joni Dufour\nNow, having taken over as the school’s director, Dr. Welsh is passionate about teaching students how policy development interacts with partisan politics, and as with many of the C150 Research Chairs, is impressed with the calibre of Canadian students, from undergraduates to postdoctoral fellows. “There’s a great foundation, and now it’s about taking it to the next level […] I want to make it much more global in its orientation, both in terms of teaching and policy impact.”\nThis is a critical time for Canada to have a convening space for important policy discussions, Dr. Welsh says. The global context — much as in 2016 — is evolving rapidly, and existing institutions are struggling to adapt to sweeping global changes, including armed conflicts, mass migration, climate change and rising populism.\nComplicating that global reality is the growth of misinformation and disinformation online — with social media often becoming a breeding-ground for abusive language, discriminatory algorithms and ideological echo chambers. Seeking to mitigate those harms, Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, Canada 150 Research Chair in New Media at Simon Fraser University, is applying data science to understand how digital media are created and consumed.\nAfter returning to Canada from the U.S. in 2018, Dr. Chun founded the Digital Democracies Institute (DDI). The team she leads comprises 20 faculty members, two postdocs and more than a dozen graduate and undergraduate students from across the humanities, social sciences and computer and information sciences.\nWendy Hui Kyong Chun, Canada 150 Research Chair in New Media. © Simon Fraser University\n“The people who typically wouldn’t speak to each other are now working together to create innovative strategies to take on the hard issues facing the online world,” she said. The DDI’s research focuses on the spread of mis/disinformation, fostering democratic exchange online, data discrimination and the causes of echo chambers, among other issues.\nBeyond her work with the DDI, Dr. Chun works to promote Canada as a global centre for media research. She has contributed policy recommendations to the Canadian Commission on Democratic Expression and the United Nations High Panel on Internet Governance.\n“We’re helping to create the next generation. We’re giving our students tools and resources not previously available in Canada, so they can take on these important issues — and become world leaders in this work,” said Dr. Chun.\n‘Time to triple research funding’\nThe new Canadian government under Liberal Prime Minister Mark Carney is promising to massively reform the Canadian economy in the face of a global trade war waged by President Trump’s second administration. The American university system is also under attack, with research funding gutted in critical areas such as climate science, and academic freedom at its most vulnerable.\nMany in the Canadian university sector believe that the turmoil south of the border presents an opportunity for Canada to again attract some of the best researchers from the U.S. and around the world. For the SSHRC’s Dr. Hewitt, recruiting the best people to keep Canada competitive in a rapidly advancing research landscape is “fundamentally a question of sovereignty.”\n“We have to look after ourselves – but we work in a global system and need to make sure borders remain open and fluid,” he said. “And as they do, we’ll make sure to make the best use of the talent that we have in Canada, attract the talent we’re able to from the outside and build the country that we all want.”\nAlàn Aspuru-Guzik, C150 Research Chair in Theoretical Chemistry. © Polina Teif\nThe new federal government promised to invest $100 million to bring researchers to Canada — particularly those whose funding has been cut in the U.S. In 2024, the previous Liberal government announced, not coincidentally in the lab of Dr. Aspuru-Guzik, $1.8 billion in federal research funding over five years. However, to date, only a fraction of that has been spent.\nThis year, Dr. Aspuru-Guzik will lose the funding provided by both of his chairs, which end in 2025, as well as investments from the U.S. He predicts his lab could be cut from 40 people to 10 by 2026. “I will do my best science I can with 10 people — but I think that’s the reality of what’s coming, and that’s a problem we have to face,” he said.\n“My message to [Prime Minister] Carney — and please quote me — is this is the moment to triple the funding for research in Canada.”\nThese four C150 Research Chairs are among the majority who intend to stay in Canada and, ideally, expand their research hubs even after the program ends. Since 2017, the chairs and their core team members have received more than 1,300 awards and trained nearly 1,000 undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.\nIn the Memory Lab, Dr. Addis foresees many more collaborations with Canadian researchers and institutions. She says she plans to apply for Canadian citizenship as soon as possible and make Canada her permanent home. “I really feel like I have found my people.”\nShe wants to advance her research by investigating how the power of our imaginations could help shift decision-making for better collective outcomes. What the C150 Research Chairs Program has made clear is that investments in Canada’s research capacity can bring positive outcomes for Canadians — at a time when we are dreaming big about our own future.\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nTags\nInnovation\nInnovation Week\nresearch\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Though such deep-fried fodder remains available, healthier options are becoming more widespread. As scientific studies highlight the harmful health effects of ultra-processed foods, awareness is growing about the benefits of a diet rich in vegetables, plant-based proteins, white meat, fish and whole grains. Young people are increasingly choosing to eat fewer animal products or to cut them out altogether, guided by their cultural or religious beliefs or their concern about the carbon footprint of raising animals for food. Students who crave a bowl of brown rice with grilled tofu and mixed vegetables, topped with green-onion-and-ginger sauce, might now be able to find it at a select Canadian university.\nEleven years ago, the Vancouver campus of the University of British Columbia (UBC) launched a food revolution. Campus food services developed a new vision of using fresh ingredients to provide healthy, delicious, inspiring, socially responsible and environmentally conscious meals. Ultra-processed foods zapped in the microwave were replaced with fresh meals made on site.\n“We had to hire a culinary team and a number of chefs to lead this revolution,” notes David Speight, executive chef and culinary director at UBC Vancouver.\nA full-time dietitian collaborated with the chefs to establish guidelines inspired by the university’s institutional values, Canada’s Food Guide and  Menus of Change (an initiative of the Culinary Institute of America and Harvard University).\nAt UBC, a typical plate consists of half fruits and/or vegetables, one-quarter protein, and one-quarter whole grains or high-fibre carbohydrates. Unsweetened milk, yogurt, and fortified plant-based beverages are available. Each service location offers daily vegetarian and vegan options.\nDietitians drive change\nOther institutions are following suit. Ontario’s University of Guelph (U of Guelph) has kept a dietitian on staff for the last two years. After participating in several training programs, its food services team now offers a menu featuring 50 per cent plant-based proteins.\nPhoto Courtesy of: University of British-Columbia\n“We have nearly 50 chefs and cooks from 12 ethnic backgrounds who infuse a tremendous amount of taste and flavour into our plant-based protein dishes,” says Vijay Nair, assistant director of culinary operations at U of Guelph. Nutrition students also promote healthy eating habits by offering nutrition education and peer support through the Student Nutrition Awareness Program (SNAP).\nIn Ottawa, Carleton University’s dietitian helps plan menus and holds free consultations for any student on a meal plan. The cafeteria has 15 stations offering a variety of options. The EatWell logo helps students identify healthy choices.\n“We are the main source of food for our 4,000 or so residents,” reasons Chad McKenzie, director of campus services at Carleton. “So it’s important to offer nutritious options.”\nWhat concrete contributions do dietitians make to university food services? “We can calculate the nutritional value of each meal,” explains Carol-Ann Robert, nutritionist-dietitian with Team Nutrition. “If it’s low in fibre, for example, we can recommend adding a vegetable to the recipe or changing out one ingredient for another. We also make sure that the menu is varied.”\nA transformation underway\nAlthough most Canadian university food services do not yet have a dietitian on staff, and many still offer a preponderance of fried foods and sandwiches on white bread, several institutions have begun transitioning to healthier options.\nUniversité de Moncton, for example, offers vegetarian fare, sourcing its vegetables from a local producer. “Many of our students come from Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Senegal,” notes Marc Surette, food services manager at Université de Moncton. “These are countries where people eat a lot of chickpeas and lentils, so we serve those on our menus.”\nEight years ago, Université de Montréal (UdeM), launched an initiative to offer a wider variety of dishes. Its menu includes vegetarian and vegan cuisine, and fish is served up once a week. It also prioritizes local sourcing — for example, buying Arctic char raised in a Montreal-based intensive water recirculation system.\n“Local sourcing is more expensive,” notes UdeM spokesperson Geneviève O’Meara, “but, on the flip side, plant-based proteins are not very expensive.”\nThe University of Saskatchewan is also bringing about change. “We now provide several plant-based options and want to offer even more,” says James McFarland, culinary services assistant director and executive chef. “We also occasionally have food like burgers on the menu, but we’re trying to educate students by providing nutritious alternatives, like our healthy bowls.”\nSetting an example\nMs. Robert feels that university food services can do more than just nourish: they can also provide an education. “The idea is not to strive for perfection, but to create an environment that encourages better habits,” she says.\nShe notes that some foods should be eaten daily, others occasionally, and others only rarely. In her view, a university should reflect this idea: “We don’t want to ban guilty pleasures, we just want to make healthier choices the norm.”\nMartine Letarte\nTags\ncampus\nfood\nhealth\nhealthy food\nnutrition\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

While touching on many topics, including the economy, defense, trade, Indigenous rights, protection of nature, border controls, gun laws and international relations, the speech had little to say regarding higher education. However, in the context of creating a new industrial strategy, the Throne Speech promised “to build hundreds of thousands of good careers in the trades and … make Canada a science and innovation hub.”\nThe speech outlined the government’s plan to ease the housing crisis by incentivizing a made-in-Canada modular housing industry and by giving tax breaks to first-time home buyers. Although it did not speak explicitly of alleviating costs for renters, many of whom are students, it did promise to cut municipal development charges for new multi-unit housing, which could potentially lower rents.\nLast week, Carney released his first official mandate letter to Cabinet, outlining a list of seven priorities. Although higher education was not mentioned explicitly, the goal of “attracting the best talent in the world to help build our economy, while returning overall immigration rates to sustainable levels” was named as the sixth priority.\nAccording to Statistics Canada, there are currently about 1.5 million temporary foreign workers and 944,000 international students (some of whom also hold work permits) in Canada. When family members are factored in, the total number of people residing in the country on work and study permits amounts to just over 2.5 million, or approximately 6.2 per cent of the total population.\nDuring the recent election campaign, Carney said that caps on international study permits imposed by the previous Liberal government would remain unchanged. The Carney government plans to issue 437,000 new study permits and extensions in 2025, down from 485,000 in 2024.\nOn the campaign trail, the Liberals also proposed a plan that would allocate $2 billion (in partnership with provinces) to develop new student housing. They also promised to invest $100 million in the Canadian Sovereignty and Resilience Fund to attract professors and graduate students whose funding is being cut in the United States.\nThis is the first time since 1977 that the reigning monarch has read the Speech from the Throne. Generally, the Governor General reads the speech as the representative of the Crown. King Charles’s visit is widely seen as a symbolic rebuke of U.S. President Donald Trump’s threats to annex Canada to the United States and as an assertion of Canada’s existence as a distinct sovereign nation.\nHailey Leggett\nHailey is a University Affairs intern.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Photo by Kate Jaimet\n0 Comments\nLast month, the Federation for the Humanities and Social Sciences (FHSS) — a pan-Canadian organization representing dozens of scholarly associations — announced that it will be unable to  hold its 2026 Congress after an unnamed institution backed out of months-long negotiations to host the event.\nIt is, instead, offering a virtual conference next year, with a “smaller-scale, in person event at a yet-to-be-determined location,” according to an announcement issued by FHSS president and CEO Karine Morin.\nCongress — whose June 2025 edition included some 7,000 faculty, graduate students and community members at Toronto’s George Brown College — is Canada’s largest academic gathering. The event has been a mainstay of Canadian humanities and social science research for nearly a century. The cancellation of the in-person event for 2026 has sent research groups into a scramble to arrange alternatives that will be smaller, less well-funded, and that will garner less attention from host venues and the public.\nThe road has been rocky for Congress since the COVID-19 pandemic, when the conference was cancelled in 2020 and moved online for 2021 and 2022.\nLast year, when Congress was to be held at McGill University in Montreal, dozens of scholarly associations cancelled their participation in the conference or made last-minute moves to alternative sites amidst an active strike by McGill professors in the Faculty of Law and a protest encampment in the field that would have hosted the Federation’s beer tent. Many research groups — my own included — found it untenable to ask delegates to gather behind picket lines in a business-as-usual manner, mere days after students had been tear-gassed on their own campus.\nWith a year to go before the next scheduled Congress in June 2026, some readers might wonder why the FHSS doesn’t simply find a new host. But the Federation has stated that alternatives have been considered, and ruled out, because of the logistics involved in mounting an event that can gather upwards of 10,000 people. For five years I ran the largest conference within Congress for the Canadian Society for the Study of Education, so I know first-hand how complex those logistical layers can be.\nHosting large scholarly gatherings has become something like the Olympics: expensive, politically fraught and an endeavour that few institutions are rushing to undertake amidst widespread austerity measures and mounting budget challenges.\nThere are alternatives to hosting conferences like Congress at universities — many comparable events in the United States are hosted at hotels and convention centers — but such venues almost always cost much more than academic spaces and come with their own suite of problems.\nSome of my colleagues have suggested that individual scholarly associations go their own way. They point to the Federation’s repeated crises as evidence that a century-old model of mega-conferencing doesn’t meet their members’ needs. They have a point: cost, accessibility and scholarly representation are serious issues that deserve attention.\nBut the death of in-person scholarly gatherings like Congress would be a real loss for Canadian research. Such gatherings create space (often imperfectly) for graduate students, early-career scholars and seasoned faculty to come together, share their research and build collaborative networks across universities, provinces and scholarly disciplines. Such conferences are one of the most reliable ways to meet with colleagues from far-flung institutions who don’t often travel to smaller research centers like my own city of Winnipeg.\nThe Federation in particular serves as an advocate for research in the Humanities and Social Sciences and dedicates significant funding to support research excellence and advance equity, diversity, inclusion and decolonization goals. Its logistical work hosting Congress each year enables many small, volunteer-run associations to focus on research instead of fiddling with administrative minutiae.\nCanadian research institutions face immense pressure, while internationally research in the humanities and social sciences is being directly threatened. Amidst this turbulence, Canadian academics need robust scholarly spaces to gather and strengthen the role of research in society. Scattering those spaces to the wind and duplicating organizing efforts does nothing to strengthen Canadian research.\nThe Federation is not a perfect organization. Its Congress has faced many challenges over the past seven years, for which it has been rightly criticized. But amidst those criticisms and the challenges facing Canadian researchers, we need universities to step up, prove that they value humanities and social sciences research, and continue to create spaces for that work to occur.\nCongress isn’t just an event, it’s a community. Creating strong research communities takes ongoing work, which means Congress needs champions willing to do that work — together.\nMichael Holden\nMichael Holden, PhD, is an assistant professor in the Faculty of Education at the University of Winnipeg.\nTags\nCongress\nFHSS\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

In 2018, 58 per cent of students at Quebec universities reported experiencing high levels of psychological distress, while in 2022, 67 per cent of students in Ontario reported a deterioration of their mental health.\nSupport measures often target individuals rather than their environment. Yet, the conceptual model for mental health surveillance developed in 2023 by the Institut national de santé publique du Québec (National public health institute of Quebec—INSPQ) illustrates that numerous environmental factors can also affect mental health.\nThe international Okanagan Charter (2015) invites universities and colleges to become health-promoting institutions. It emphasizes creating healthy living environments and reminds institutions of their responsibility to support this endeavour.\nHow can postsecondary institutions promote healthy environments?\nWe recently conducted a comprehensive review of environmental factors affecting the mental health of postsecondary students. We identified three broad categories:\nHousing environment\nSocial environment\nBuilt environment\nThe vital role of housing\nHousing is a fundamental determinant of good mental health and academic success. It is especially important in the context of the current housing crisis. The “housing environment” category includes the social and built characteristics of student dwellings. High-quality housing and access to indoor or outdoor greenery generally contribute to better mental health. Conversely, living in a small space (less than 60 m2) is associated with a greater risk of symptoms of mental distress.\nSocial environments: powerful yet invisible\nThe “social environment” category encompasses the various aspects of collective life, such as social capital and social cohesion. Having a large network and good supports, feeling connected and integrated into the learning environment, and living in a setting that prioritizes well-being and connection are all factors associated with better mental health. By contrast, the social environment in postsecondary institutions can also encourage student alcohol and drug use by normalizing or rewarding these behaviours. Discrimination or violence are associated with a higher risk of symptoms of mental distress and decreased mental health.\nBuilt environment: a boon to mental health — and the planet\nThe “built environment” category relates to natural and human-made features and amenities, such as urban design, green areas and public spaces. In general, exposure to nature and greenery is associated with better mental health. Quieter neighbourhoods with little traffic or pollution promote mental wellness, as does a walkable or bikeable environment. A high-quality campus setting, both indoors and outdoors, is also beneficial; for example, green spaces mitigate heat islands while beautifying the academic surroundings.\nHow can postsecondary institutions create environments that promote mental health?\nThe Okanagan Charter includes two calls to action. We’ve added our thoughts to these, informed by our comprehensive review:\nIntegrate health into all aspects of campus culture.\nPostsecondary institutions must create policies prioritizing inclusion and health. These policies enable the creation of social environments that promote connection and safety. To achieve this, institutions must understand how an environment can be experienced differently by different people. It is essential to take into account the different perspectives and needs of a diverse student body.\nUndertake actions and partnerships that promote health, both locally and globally.\nEducational institutions must identify collaborative opportunities to shape student environments on multiple levels. It’s important to decide which locations to prioritize, both on and off campus, and to identify the most influential players in each of these settings.\nTo learn more:\nStation SME offers information and tools to support educational institutions in creating learning environments that promote student mental health by addressing related environmental factors. A reflexive tool is available to guide institutions in this exercise.\nThis article is part of a monthly series on student mental health in higher education by the Observatoire sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur (Observatory on Student Mental Health in Higher Education—OSMÉES) and the Initiative sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur (Initiative for student mental health in higher education—ISMÉ).\nJustine Pineault, François Lauzier-Jobin & Martine Shareck\nJustine Pineault is a doctoral candidate in community health at Université de Sherbrooke and contributes to OSMÉES’s T1 pillar on healthy environments.\nFrançois Lauzier-Jobin is a social worker, assistant professor at Université de Sherbrooke’s nursing department, and head of OSMÉES’s T13 pillar on expanding mental health services.\nMartine Shareck is an associate professor of community health at Université de Sherbrooke and Tier 2 Canada Research Chair on Urban Health Equity and Young People (2020–2026). She also heads OSMÉES’s T1 pillar on healthy environments.\nTags\nOSMEES\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Op-eds emerge, declaring either the death of Canadianization or its survival, sprinkled with anecdotes from a few departments. Meanwhile, those of us who have spent years looking into professors’ CVs have been watching this predictable cycle for decades.\nThe latest round in University Affairs features Ari Gandsman‘s warning of systematic Americanization squeezing out Canadian talent, while Dominik Stecuła sees Trump’s academic crackdown as Canada’s opportunity to attract displaced American scholars. Both bring compelling anecdotes, but they’re missing key parts of the story.\nWhat is unfolding is more complicated and nuanced: While both authors treat current pro-American hiring patterns as deviations from an imagined Canada-centric norm, such a norm existed only briefly — if at all — at many of Canada’s leading research universities. In the social sciences, especially, faculty hiring reflects a clear transition in influence: from British-trained scholars in the first half of the 20th century to a dominant reliance on U.S.-trained faculty after the Second World War.\nThe Canadianization movement of the 1970s and early 1980s sought to alter that trend, leading to formal policies in 1981 that required preference for Canadian citizens and landed immigrants in all aspects of academic hiring. But for the only three Canadian institutions ranked among the top 50 in the 2025 QS World University Rankings — McGill, the University of Toronto (U of T) and the University of British Columbia (UBC) — Canadianization turned out to be just a historical anomaly. Since the late 1980s, a great divergence at the institutional level has created two distinct spheres within Canadian English-speaking research universities, moving in different, often competing, directions regarding the doctoral origins of the scholars they hire.\nIn 2018, this article’s co-author Francois Lachapelle and sociologist Patrick John Burnett published the award-winning study “Replacing the Canadianization Generation: An Examination of Faculty Composition from 1977 through 2017” in the Canadian Review of Sociology. The Relational-Academia dataset tracked 4,935 faculty across five social science disciplines (anthropology, economics, political science, psychology, and sociology) at Canada’s U15 universities over four decades, with comprehensive PhD data.\nThe analysis of hiring patterns at McGill, U of T, and UBC — let’s call them “the triad”— reveals the stark reality. Between 1977 and 2017, these institutions drew 65 per cent of their social sciences faculty from U.S. universities and just 22 per cent from Canadian institutions. Of that modest Canadian share, 62 per cent represent cases of the triad trading PhDs among themselves or hiring their own graduates. This leaves a mere eight per cent of faculty positions at these three universities going to PhDs from all other Canadian institutions over four decades.\nPhD placement patterns at McGill, U of T and UBC, 1977-2017\nThis diagram maps the aggregate hiring patterns of U of T, McGill, and UBC’s Vancouver campus between 1977 and 2017, showing all institutions that placed at least 20 PhDs across the five social sciences disciplines of anthropology, economics, political science, psychology and sociology.\nBlue ribbons dominate the visual space, showing the overwhelming flow from U.S. institutions, mostly elite ones, to these three schools. Harvard leads, followed by Berkeley, Yale and Chicago — the familiar hierarchy of American academic prestige. Purple ribbons represent cross-hiring among the triad, while green ribbons show self-hiring, where institutions recruit their own PhDs (so-called academic inbreeding). Pink ribbons from the London School of Economics, Oxford and Cambridge show some presence from elite U.K. institutions — actually, as much as the rest of Canadian schools combined.\nThe narrow red ribbons tell the most revealing story: the limited access that other Canadian PhD-granting institutions face in placing their PhDs in the triad network. The green ribbon at U of T alone — representing self-hiring — is as thick as all the red ribbons combined.\nPhD Placement Patterns at Canada’s 12 Other Research Universities, 1977-2017\nThis figure shows hiring patterns in Canada’s 12 remaining.  U15 research universities in the same five social sciences disciplines. Red ribbons now dominate the plot, showing robust circulation among Canadian institutions — the Canadianization movement at work.\nThe blue ribbons representing U.S. schools are still present but tell a somewhat different story: The highest-prestige brands like Harvard and Yale represent a smaller proportion of the total, sharing space with respected but less renowned institutions. The grey ribbons show the full national weight of the triad, with U of T (with 261 placements), McGill (139) and UBC (110) serving as the top PhD suppliers to the rest of Canada’s research-intensive academic field. It’s a telling asymmetric relationship: McGill, U of T, and UBC primarily look past Canadian academia and outward to the U.S. for their own hiring, securing national and global prestige in the process, while serving as the primary PhD suppliers to the rest of Canada’s research-intensive universities. These three institutions serve as an interface between the global prestige economy and the domestic Canadian academic ecosystem.\nWe aim to release the Relational-Academia dataset publicly this year. In order to go beyond 2017 and track more contemporary trends, Lachapelle and Burnett’s most recent project, Subfield, has compiled the doctoral origins of all professors employed at Canadian universities across all disciplines for the 2022–23 academic year — the first complete national faculty census of its kind. Such efforts aim to contribute to a critical understanding of how academia and hiring practices are evolving in response to broader institutional and global pressures.\nThe End of Canadianization?\nThe continued dominance of U.S.-trained faculty at the triad is not incidental. Even during the height of the Canadianization movement, the triad retained over 65 per cent U.S.-trained hires, while that number declined to below 50 per cent in other Canadian universities. For the triad, status-group dynamics and hierarchies of prestige likely worked in favour of U.S.-trained candidates.\nThe institutional prestige and visibility of McGill, U of T and UBC likely attracted applicants from elite U.S. programs, whose graduates often carry strong publication records and embedded professional networks. But what counts as a “good scholar” is shaped by more than productivity — status signals, institutional prestige, and cultural fit all matter.  For the rest of the U15, the long-term trend toward Canadian-trained hires may have reflected both policy incentives and a commitment to developing domestic academic capacity, as well as a different applicant pool.\nBut 21st century trends are once again reshaping the landscape. The 2001 policy change that relaxed the Canadian First policy, which had previously required universities to advertise domestically before seeking international applicants, enabled universities to recruit internationally, thus re-inviting the influx of U.S.-trained scholars. This, combined with rising retirements among professors hired during the Canadianization era, an international student gold rush, and intensifying global rankings pressures shifted hiring patterns at schools like McMaster, Waterloo and Western beginning in the early 2000s. Together, these forces have nudged many institutions closer to the gravitational pull of American academia, once again reshaping not only who gets hired but also what Canadian academia aspires to be.\n*\nFrancois Lachapelle, PhD, is the lead scientist at subfield.dev and an academic program market analyst at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan.\nX.

But in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Quebec government made it a ministerial priority, thanks in no small part to the advocacy work of college and university associations. Today, the website Station SME provides an extensive catalogue of mental health resources and services accessible to students.\nJust because mental health services are available on campus, however, doesn’t necessarily mean that students will use them. Even today, a variety of barriers prevent students from accessing the services they need, when they need them. Some derive from students’ personal circumstances, such as their financial resources or time constraints, especially given their academic commitments. Additionally, the effects of poor mental health and past negative experiences may hinder students in seeking help.\nAccessing services isn’t only a personal choice. There are broader sociocultural and institutional factors at play. The visibility, availability and specificity of services in higher-education settings significantly influence accessibility. Similarly, the stigma surrounding mental health issues can discourage some students from reaching out.\nCase management: a promising approach\nSome post-secondary institutions have developed applications and ​​​websites​ to promote their mental-health services, such as the Plant des ressources at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi. While it’s certainly important to communicate the availability of services, this strategy alone is not sufficient, especially when students must wade through a vast array of offerings. Case management, a promising approach used in social work, has already been adopted by a number of institutions.\nIn simple terms, case managers provide individuals with personalized follow-up while coordinating and facilitating access to the institutional and community resources they need.​​ Recent research suggests case management has many benefits in the post-secondary context, from helping students with the transition to campus, to holistically addressing complex​ or specific needs​, to offering appropriate responses during crises, especially those related to social​​ health. However, the academic literature on the implementation and effectiveness of case management in post-secondary settings is relatively scarce and rarely identifies a preferred approach.\nStrengths as a pathway to recovery\nIn mental health, case management has been in wide application around the world since the 1980s. Various models are used, including broker, clinical case management, rehabilitation and​ ​strengths. The Strengths Model, which emerged about forty years ago, is today viewed as one of the most successful at helping individuals towards recovery. It is based on six fundamental principles: 1) everyone can recover; 2) the focus is on strengths rather than limitations; 3) the relationship is primary and egalitarian; 4) ​​​​the client directs the intervention; 5) the ​​intervention takes place in locations that are significant to the client; and 6) the community and environment are essential resources.\nWhile at first glance this model can appear simple, in reality it demands a range of complex skills that are honed in the back-and-forth between training and real-world practice. Champions of this approach highlight the importance of professional supervision. While the Strengths Model is considered effective at assisting individuals with severe mental health issues, its implementation and effectiveness among younger populations are not well documented. Our team’s comprehensive study identified only about ten published studies worldwide on implementing the model for young adults.\nMoving towards strengths-based case management​​?\nFrom the above, two key points emerge: case management appears to effectively address the needs of post-secondary students, and the strengths-based approach supports recovery for individuals living with mental health challenges. Starting from this premise, our team decided to focus on adapting and deploying the Strengths Model in Quebec’s institutions of higher learning. Our initial analyses show that, to varying degrees, practitioners in these settings are already using the core principles of the strengths-based approach. Nonetheless, our findings reveal the need for structured support and ongoing training to ensure that the six principles are truly integrated into practice.\nGoing forward, our ​​research will explore the adaptations needed for the Strengths Model to function in post-secondary settings. This will then pave the way for developing methods to assess its implementation and effectiveness.\nThis article is part of a  series on student mental health in higher education produced by the Observatoire sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur (OSMÉES) (Observatory on student mental health in higher education) and the Initiative sur la santé mentale étudiante en enseignement supérieur (ISMÉ) (Student Mental Health Initiative in Higher Education).\nChristiane Bergeron-Leclerc, Jacques Cherblanc, Eve Boily, Eve Pouliot, Julie Lane, Benjamin Gallais, François Lauzier-Jobin, Marjolaine Tremblay, Camille Gagnon-Béland, Catherine Roy-Boulanger, Mégane Girard, Marie-Édith Vigneau & Geneviève Reed\nTags\nmental health\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

He works with faculty to develop and adapt courses and content with Indigenous approaches or Indigenous histories relevant to their field, while also trying to foster broader institutional change to integrate Indigenous perspectives in university teaching and learning.\nA registered psychotherapist and board certified behaviour analyst, Mr. Busch has over two decades of experience in mental health. He is also a doctoral student in the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education’s adult education and community development program, where he is a Vanier Scholar and was awarded the 2024 Talent Award from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council. He says his original training was very quantitative – “evidence-based practice is the word that we love in the mental health world” – but he experienced a turning point that shifted his approach: his own experience with mental health struggles.\n“Many Indigenous people or First Nations people understand that our communities are filled with constant loss and constant unresolved grief, and this impact of intergenerational trauma is very real,” he says. In his 20s, he had his first real panic attack. “I did the whole classic ‘I think I’m dying’,” he says. “I knew that people who had panic disorders immediately think they’re having a heart attack. They try to find a medical explanation. They refuse to believe that this could possibly be psychological.” Despite knowing this, he followed the same path and went about trying to “cure himself in the most scientific way possible,” he says. While there was some benefit to this approach, the anxiety continued to occupy him and he decided to look elsewhere.\nA Bear Clan member of Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation, a community in northern Manitoba, Mr. Busch was well connected to cultural practice when he was young. However, after suffering intense racism during his teenage years in Saskatchewan, he says he had distanced himself from his Indigeneity. For years, his mother and other relatives encouraged him to attend Sundance, one of their most important ceremonies. “When I started to really struggle with my own mental wellness and I wasn’t finding answers anywhere, I thought, well, what the hell?” and “the first time I attended Sundance was just a radical change in my perspective,” he says.\nHe says that he doesn’t think that healing within First Nations communities will come from external mental health systems. “I think it will come from the development of the natural helping systems that are already there,” he says. Western institutions not only fail to acknowledge these systems, he says, but they actively suppress them. “There’s so much potential for those resources to be leveraged in a way that could be really meaningful.”\nHe became interested in the idea of helpers and helping work in all forms, “whether it’s a mental health professional, an elder, a knowledge keeper, a traditional practitioner, a natural helper in community,” he says. They don’t all have a designated role, but they’re seen by the community as leaders and as helpers. His doctoral research reflects this, and he hopes to articulate the conceptual, practical and relational aspects of helping work as described by Indigenous helpers. He has been visiting communities in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, focusing on Cree helpers. “My hope is that by developing a coherent theory of helping work it could be applied in the development of culturally relevant mental health practices,” he says.\nMr. Busch’s doctoral supervisor Jennifer Wemigwans says that his grounding in Indigenous knowledge has enabled him to “take that paradigm and use it in the health field – in a colonial field and space but bring in this diverse knowledge.” By doing that, he is “really shaking up and creating a new space in health research, in health in the community and in health resources,” she says. “I really feel that it’s important that we start to honor and acknowledge Indigenous knowledge within its own right and start to say how this is a valuable contribution in these spaces,” says Dr. Wemigwans.\nIn his new position, Mr. Busch has the opportunity to extend his impact across a range of disciplines. He says he is hoping to take “a teach-a-man-to-fish approach” to the role, where faculty work with communities to develop resources and materials that could be used on an ongoing basis. “There’s a finite amount of knowledge resources in community,” he says. “It’s a bit challenging for institutions to rely fully on Indigenous knowledge keepers, elders, scholars, researchers, to do the work of indigenization, decolonization, reconciliation, etc.” An important part of his role will be supporting faculty to do some of that work in a way that is informed by communities and is Indigenous-led, but that it isn’t a brain drain on the communities.\nOne of Mr. Busch’s first projects has been working on a workshop on the terminology associated with Indigenous pedagogies. “We throw these words around – indigenization, decolonization, resurgence, reconciliation – and there is a lot of discussion on all of those terms,” he says. He is working on a resource for faculty that would discuss these terms, their meaning, considerations, controversies and their practical application. He is also conducting an environmental scan of Canadian universities to see what others are doing on Indigenous pedagogy and curriculum development. “I know that there are some folks out there, Indigenous scholars that are just doing some really incredible groundbreaking work in this area and I’m really eager to learn from them.”\nMr. Busch says both of his parents are lifelong helpers and he has always felt a sense of responsibility to give back to community. “I’m also a Bear Clan member,” he says, “and in this clan system, there is a kinship responsibility.” Each clan has different responsibilities to community, such as leadership or education. “Bears have their nose to the ground and are always sniffing out the different medicines,” he says. “The idea is that the Bear Clan are kind of the carriers of medicine. They’re like the helpers and healers. I take that responsibility seriously and I try to align my values with those kinship responsibilities.”\nSparrow McGowan\nSparrow McGowan is a freelance journalist, writer and editor based in Ottawa.\nTags\nAutochtones\nIndigenous\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Stretching from Halifax Harbour to downtown Vancouver, these postsecondary institutions have been educating graduates for more than a century. Despite that history, their contribution to Canadian culture and economy remains underrecognized. Now, the leaders of Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD) University, NSCAD University, Alberta University of the Arts (AUArts) and Emily Carr University of Art + Design (ECU) have joined forces to form a new coalition. Tentatively named the UAD4 it aims to amplify their impact through a collective voice.\n“Essentially you could say we are the engine that creates arts and culture in this country,” says Ana Serrano, OCAD University’s president and vice-chancellor. “And as the engine that accelerates and develops the talent feeding into the entire creative economy in this country, we have an outsize role to play in how the Canadian future unfolds and evolves.”\nPhoto courtesy of: OCAD University\nThere are scores of art and design programs in Canada, but only four publicly funded universities entirely committed to these areas of study. Founded between the late 1870s and mid-1920s as vocational schools for largely male visual artists, they now offer programs in an array of art, design, media and creative disciplines. Programs range from the classics – such as painting, sculpture or photography – to contemporary specialities such as environmental design, integrated media and experimental animation. OCAD U is Canada’s largest, with 17 undergraduate and seven master’s degrees while Vancouver’s Emily Carr consistently ranks among the top 25 art and design universities in the world.\n“We recognize that there’s more that holds us together than separates us,” says Trish Kelly, ECU’s president and vice-chancellor. “This is a real opportunity to think about not just what we do for our local economies in context, but what we do for Canada. That’s really what this is about.”\nThe four schools have a combined total of 10,000 students each year – about half the size of Canada’s smallest research university. But UAD4 leaders are proud to note that their graduates’ impact defies expectations.\nThe creative sector contributes more than $50 billion to the national economy each year and employs nearly 740,000 people. While UAD4 grads are the sector’s driving force, many Canadians  – and their provincial governments – remain unclear, or maybe even unaware, of the extent to which art and design universities are crucial to the economy, say their leaders. “It’s easy to see why people miss what happens at arts school. But to be honest, our students and our alum are changing the world around us anyway,” says Dr. Kelly.\nThe trope of the struggling artist has long been worn out, say UAD4 leaders. A recent survey by OCAD U shows that more than 80 per cent of students are employed six months after they graduate. Alumni generally find work within their fields as graphic designers, illustrators, and writers among other creative disciplines. But many graduates also go on to work in everything from city planning to advertising and community development. “You name an industry, they’re at the forefront of it,” says Dr. Kelly.\n“It’s easy to see why people miss what happens at arts school. But to be honest, our students and our alum are changing the world around us.”\nThe same survey showed that more than 90 per cent of art and design graduates describe themselves as ‘their own boss.’ “A lot of our students ultimately are creative entrepreneurs that span across multiple sectors,” says Ms. Serrano. “The idea that somehow you go to art school, you become an artist, and that the artist is starving is a very traditional way of thinking about what is actually happening.”\n‘All of our programs are expensive.’\nA primary motivator for the coalition is the financial uncertainty that continues to plague Canada’s postsecondary education sector. The cap on international student study permits  imposed by the federal government in 2024 cut by nearly half a significant source of revenue for universities, while in some provinces operating grants have not kept pace with inflation. “Let’s face it, it isn’t exactly the smoothest sailing for universities right now,” says Dr. Kelly.\nAdding to that financial burden, the UAD4 face distinct challenges. Much of art and design teaching is practice-based education whereby students learn from practitioners in their field in a hands-on learning environment with small class sizes, such as a studio or workshop. Classes generally require expensive materials and technology – from oil paints and precious metals to 3D printers, laser cutters and virtual reality headsets. “We need state-of-the-art tools and facilities to train the next generation in both an academic and more industrial environment. It’s very expensive,” says president emeritus Peggy Shannon of NSCAD University, formally the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. Dr. Shannon, who previously served as chair of the school of performance at Toronto Metropolitan University, says at larger universities, the costs of practice-based classes or studios can be fiscally balanced by larger, revenue-generating lecture-based courses.\nArt and design universities aren’t afforded this luxury, and it’s a ubiquitous problem across the UAD4. “It’s harder to pack thousands of students into labs when they’re meant to be working with their hands,” says Ms. Serrano. “Part of our challenge, and opportunity, is figuring out how to bring that studio-based education into the 21st century.”\nLocal and regional communities\nOne of the goals of the UAD4 is to help both the public and provincial governments understand how art and design universities benefit their local economies. Over half of NSCAD graduates launch their own companies, not-for-profits or galleries, while the large majority find work in a creative field. “They contribute to the workforce,” says Dr. Shannon, “That’s obvious to me, but not necessarily to others.”\nThe province of Nova Scotia is currently trying to double its population to 2 million by 2060 to address labour shortages and boost its economy. But the provincial government doesn’t always make the connection between achieving that goal and Nova Scotia’s cultural scene, says Dr. Shannon. “Halifax and Nova Scotia are beautiful, and we offer the art and culture of the province and this region. I wouldn’t want to move to a new place just to be a doctor – I’d like it to be a nice place to live,” she says. One of the university’s three campuses is situated in the Halifax port, where 350,000 tourists pass every day. “We call it our front yard. We are contributing to what tourists see, think and feel about Halifax.”\nPhoto by: Caitlin Boyle\nAlberta University of the Arts, which is set to celebrate its 100th anniversary next year, is the largest employer of artists in Calgary. “The way we engage with the city is through the work that our faculty, alumni and students are doing,” says president emeritus Daniel Doz. The university partnered with the City of Calgary in 2023 to have alumni design visuals for concrete safety barriers that were installed between traffic lanes and summer patios. During the pandemic, “garage art” galleries popped up throughout Calgary’s residential neighbourhoods – nearly 40 per cent of those exhibits were AUArts alumni. “So [those examples] are the kind of thing, the visual interaction, where the influence isn’t in your face but maybe a little more subtle,” adds Dr. Doz. “When you’re the art school in town, our influence is relevant everywhere, depending on who wants to engage with us.”\nHowever, Dr. Doz admits that having that relevance recognized by the provincial government is challenging. The relationship between postsecondary institutions and the government has shifted significantly since he first became leader 15 years ago. “Postsecondary institutions are perceived as an instrument of economic prosperity – which is not false, each institution has an economic footprint,” he says. “But the relationship has shifted to how does it support a political agenda … because politicians now, their horizon is the next election.”\nIt’s the job of the UAD4 leaders to try to align their missions with that more narrow-minded focus of how some politicians look at the future. “That tension is challenging to navigate at the provincial level, so the four of us can have a little more weight by really sharing that message,” he says.\nUnique student body\nThe diversity of the student body is another unique characteristic of art and design universities. At AUArts, more than a third of students have at least one declared disability, while at NSCAD that number rises to about 42 per cent, with mental heath and learning challenges being the most prevalent. The two universities also have a high number of students who identify as 2SLGBTQ: 60 per cent at AUArts and more than three-quarters at NSCAD.\n“You have a population that exists in art school that society would say exists on the fringe,” says Dr. Doz. Arts schools are often the place where they find community, acceptance and support.\nAlberta University for the Arts also has a higher number of Indigenous students compared to most universities, not only for of its location on Treaty 7 territory but because of its style of teaching. “We teach by making – much in the oral tradition,” he says. “I have an Elder Council and the bands and reserves that they come from, it’s all oral history. When you teach by looking at things, by talking and then making, it caters to people who don’t learn in a traditional way.”\nIndigenous representation at the institution has helped guide the “artistic and cultural conversations” that have occurred across Western Canada, according to Dr. Doz. He points to alum and world-renowned First Nations artist Alex Janvier, who is considered a pioneer of contemporary and abstract Indigenous art.\n“We need state-of-the-art tools and facilities to train the next generation in both an academic and more industrial environment. It’s very expensive.”\nDr. Kelly, at ECU, says the school’s Health and Design Lab is symbolic of how art and design universities bring criticality and awareness to Canada’s progress on goals including truth and reconciliation. For instance, the lab’s interdisciplinary team includes design students, faculty and research associates who partner with the ECU’s Aboriginal Gathering Place. Together, they host Elders, nurses, health care workers and community organizations to create and share stories about racism in the health care system and amplify voices often missing in conversations about systemic health inequities.\n“I’ve had the privilege to be witness to some of those gatherings. But I can only say they’ve brought light and hope and even joy to those individuals who’ve come together to communicate about these difficult issues,” says Dr. Kelly.\nWhile the coalition is still in its nascent stage, the UAD4 aim to meet quarterly to discuss the best way to advocate for their collective needs – but also for a better future for Canadians.  Ms. Serrano, who co-chairs the Open Democracy project, an initiative that develops partnerships to reimagine democracy, says art and design skills are essential to graduates that will help define systems for the future. “What artists and designers know well is that they don’t know what will come next,” she says. Being comfortable with what might emerge – in the artistic process or in society – provides an adaptability that “everyone needs” in a rapidly changing place.\nThat unique perspective is invaluable  when tackling complex questions about how to move forward in the face of national and international problems. Artists and designers, says Dr. Kelly, can help imagine solutions to the “complex, knotted, sticky problems” facing Canadian society.\n“My concern is how to instill hope, how to make sure we are actually moving in a coherent and strategic way to make change in a world that quite dramatically needs it,” she says. “If we can’t apply curiosity, imagination and creativity to those sticky problems, we’re never going to find solutions.”\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

What are the long-term effects of the gender imbalance on campus –– and what can we do about it?\nBy\nSonia Mendes\nApril 30, 2025\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nGraphic by: Edward Thomas Swan\nRead this article in French\n2 Comments\nWhen Tia Lovegrove walked into her political science class on the first day of a new semester in January 2025 she was struck with a realization.\n“There was only one male student in that class; out of 25, I saw one male student,” says Ms. Lovegrove, a fourth-year student completing a double major in political science and law, justice and society at Dalhousie University in Halifax.\nOver the past four years, she has grown accustomed to seeing few males in her classes, particularly in law classes.\n“In half my classes, we have barely any male enrolment,” says Ms. Lovegrove, who plans to pursue law school after she completes her undergraduate degree. “I feel like it’s almost normalized that if you’re going into these classes there’s not going to be very many male students in them; no one has really ever said anything.”\nMs. Lovegrove’s experience reflects a reality that Canada’s postsecondary institutions seem reticent to discuss: Campuses are dominated by female students while male enrolment has stagnated –– and it’s been happening for decades.\nOn average, postsecondary campuses consist of 56.1 per cent women and 43.9 per cent men, according to 2022-23 data from Statistics Canada.\nIn 2024-25, undergraduate students at Dalhousie consisted of 54 per cent females and 44 per cent males (with two per cent of students identifying as “other”). Female enrolment was slightly higher amongst graduate students, with 57 per cent females, 42 per cent males (one per cent identifying as “other”). By faculty, female undergraduates dominated in agriculture, architecture, arts and social sciences, health, science, dentistry, law and even medicine. Only the faculties of computer science, engineering, and management had higher male enrolment.\n“We are aware of the ongoing challenges in achieving balanced gender representation across various fields of study,” a Dalhousie spokesperson wrote in an emailed statement to University Affairs. “We are committed to identifying and addressing barriers to ensure that all students, regardless of gender, feel supported in pursuing their academic and professional aspirations.” When asked whether the university has any specific measures to address the gender imbalance the spokesperson declined comment, reiterating that university administrators “monitor and measure many aspects of our enrolment data.”\nAt the University of Montreal, the numbers are considerably higher. A 2022 UdeMNovelles article noted that nearly seven out of every 10 students at the university were women. Statistics from 2024 are consistent with that figure, with over 67 per cent of students identifying as female.\n“The statistics have been stable over the last few years, and it’s true that the trend has reversed, with more women than men in higher education,” wrote a University of Montreal spokesperson in an emailed statement. “It’s also worth noting that more girls are graduating from high school, so the pool of women applying to pursue their studies at university is correspondingly larger. The issue of gender-based recruitment is a sensitive one these days; that’s why we advocate that our recruitment strategies are as inclusive as possible.”\nBack in the classroom, Ms. Lovegrove worries that student discussions at Dalhousie are often missing the male perspective.\n“In a political science class, or focusing on big topics like human rights, I feel like you do have to have multiple perspectives to be able to fully understand such a big issue,” she says.\nAt Carleton University in Ottawa, Cara Gordon shares similar concerns.\n“It’s definitely imbalanced; we kind of joke about it,” says Ms. Gordon, a third-year journalism and humanities student. “In humanities, we’re a class of about 30 right now and in my year I believe there’s six guys.”\nIn one of her seminar groups, which are intended to facilitate discussion, there are no males at all, she adds.\n“I was thinking, ‘Would the guys bring something up that we wouldn’t think about?’” she says.\nThings haven’t always been so lopsided in the journalism and humanities program, says Dr. Gregory MacIsaac, associate professor of humanities at Carleton.\n“It wasn’t the case when the program started [in 2014]; almost half the class was men,” recalls Dr. MacIsaac, who helped to design the program, offered jointly by the university’s college of the humanities and journalism and communication school. “And then that started to go down slowly. Over the last three years, in a class of 30, there were like seven or five males.”\nDr. MacIsaac admits he’s perplexed by the dwindling male enrolment. Carleton University declined interview requests with their recruitment and enrolment team members and did not provide a statement about the imbalance of gender enrolment.\n“It really has changed; I don’t know why,” he says. “It’s very tempting to come up with an easy answer and say, ‘Oh, well, you’re doing humanities and that just is soft,’ and it appeals to women more than men, but it’s rather insulting and sexist.”\nIn fact, findings from a recent study at the University of Zurich directly supports the theory that men selectively leave occupations and specializations, and devalue them, when the number of women in these jobs increases –– a concept sometimes called the “male flight theory.”\n“When comparing two hypothetical occupations that are identical in all occupational characteristics and only differ in the share of female inflow (25% vs. 75%), the analysis shows that men are twice as likely to leave the feminizing occupation,” according to lead researcher Dr. Per Block, professor of sociology at the University of Zurich.\n“Young males are dropping out of the labour force. They are dropping out of school. They are nowhere. They’re in their parents’ basements, and I think that’s very scary for the future.”\nLong-term economic and social impacts\nMiana Plesca, a professor in the department of economics and finance at the University of Guelph, doesn’t mince words about the state of male postsecondary enrolment.\n“There are nearly two girls for every boy that graduates,” says Dr. Plesca of the overall female to male ratio. “Young males are dropping out of the labour force. They are dropping out of school. They are nowhere. They’re in their parents’ basements, and I think that’s very scary for the future.”\nFor the 2022-2023 academic year at Guelph, 60 per cent of undergraduate students were female. Dr. Plesca explains she has studied the trend with her students and the gender gap goes back decades.\n“We went back with some students to the first year of the labour force survey, where we could find data –– in 1978,” she says. “Already in 1978 more women were graduating than men; it’s not a recent phenomenon.”\nAs a specialist in labour economics, Dr. Plesca says she’s concerned that males opting out of postsecondary education will have a hard time in the future labour market.\n“Economists worry because of skill,” she explains. “Skill is ever more important; with AI and everything, low-skill jobs are getting obsolete and they’re getting replaced by robots, and you need high-skilled workers. And because of the university access, the high-skilled workers in the labour force are more likely to be female.”\nStagnating male enrolment is not just a Canadian issue. Dr. Claudia Buchmann is a distinguished professor of sociology at The Ohio State University. In 2013 she co-authored a book with Thomas A. DiPrete called The Rise of Women: The Growing Gender Gap in Education and What it Means for American Schools.\n“This is pretty much a global trend,” says Dr. Buchmann. “In the book we have a map of the world that shows, at the time of writing, that for the majority of countries in the world, especially industrialized countries, now more women are enrolled in higher education and complete college degrees everywhere in the world. That was pretty striking to us.”\nLike Dr. Plesca, Dr. Buchmann is concerned for the long-term economic well-being of men.\n“By all arguments, the college degree still is very much an important piece of social mobility,” she says, noting that in the U.S., a college degree is ranked at the same academic level as a university degree.\nBeyond potentially stunted earning potential, Dr. Buchmann worries about intangible gaps in male socialization.\n“Think about what higher education can do in terms of being able to develop critical thinking, being able to be presented with diverse ideas or views from people who come from very different perspectives,” she says, adding that “Education for Citizenship” is her university’s motto. “It’s important to be in those social environments, interacting with someone that’s very different from you –– an international student or a student from a different part of the country, from a rural area versus an urban area.”\nShe points to worrisome ideologies in the U.S. which have been creeping into Canada as well.\n“Schools are just a microcosm of what’s being reflected in the larger society,” she explains. “And in the United States right now, we have a really serious problem of the resurgence of this kind of patriarchal notion of ‘make America great again,’ and [the threat to] traditional family structures. And all of these things are, I think, largely due to the fact that some young men are feeling the decline in patriarchy has meant that they’re worse off and that women are to blame for that.”\nChoosing a different path\nSo, what are young men doing if they’re not choosing to attend postsecondary institutions? In Canada, some are lured by the entry-level earning potential of the oil patch. Kyle Cyr, now 24, graduated from high school in Edmonton in 2019. Although he had respectable grades in high school and university was “definitely a possibility,” Mr. Cyr jumped at the chance to earn some good money instead.\n“I ended up getting a job basically the weekend after I graduated, working just south of Edmonton in Nisku on an oil rig; I worked there for just over 10 months,” he says. “Jumping out of high school and then earning oil rig money, it was pretty crazy.”\nUltimately, he says the money wasn’t enough to keep him there for the long run.\nSo Mr. Cyr took on several roles, including as a barista at a climbing gym and a greenskeeper at a golf course, before finding work he loves at Rabbit Hill, a ski resort on the banks of the North Saskatchewan River. Today, as the terrain park supervisor, he manages staff and uses heavy machinery to build the jumps and rails for snowboarding.\n“Being able to do a job that involves my passion, I couldn’t ask for anything else,” enthuses Mr. Cyr, who has been an avid snowboarder since the age of 12. “Obviously it doesn’t pay as well as some other jobs would, but at the same time, I’m willing to sacrifice that little bit of pay for waking up and actually being excited to go to work.”\n“K to 12 should pay a bit more attention to why girls do better than boys in school –– pay more attention to pedagogy and see what makes boys more motivated and engaged.”\nKieran O’Donnell, 19, also opted out of college or university. While attending high school in Ottawa, he considered several career paths.\n“I thought about going to other industries, like electrician, where you obviously need to go to college to get your certificates,” he recalls, adding he always did well in school despite not loving it. “I wanted to be a paramedic at one point; I had a bunch of ideas bouncing around.”\nIt was the thought of enduring more lecture-style classes that altered Mr. O’Donnell’s trajectory.\n“I was just sitting in class and I thought, ‘I cannot do this for another two to four or whatever, how many years,” he says.\nWhen he was 16, Mr. O’Donnell had worked with an interlock company as part of a high school co-op program. That experience turned out to be life-changing.\n“I’m one of those kids who just can’t sit still; I’ve always got to be doing something,” he says. “Co-op was an amazing opportunity for me, as it was for many people, specifically males.”\nWhile still in Grade 12, he launched his own contracting business –– O’Donnell Contracting –– specializing in interlock patios and garden beds. Like Kyle Cyr, Mr. O’Donnell loves the physical, outdoor nature of his work.\n“One thing I love about my job is I’m outside,” he says. “I’m talking to people, I’m enjoying the beautiful summer; I just love what I do.”\nMr. O’Donnell notes that the financial investment required for a postsecondary education was a deterrent for him.\n“Knowing I wanted to go into business and be making money, going into school to spend a bunch of money before you even made any seems like a step backwards for me,” he says. “I have no student debt. I’ve been working.”\nFinding new ways to engage male students\nKyle Cyr and Kieran O’Donnell are examples of bright, young men who chose not to pursue postsecondary education. To encourage more men to continue their education, Dr. Plesca suggests the Canadian public school system should consider how boys learn differently compared with their female peers.\n“K[indergarten] to [Grade] 12 should pay a bit more attention to why girls do better than boys in school –– pay more attention to pedagogy and see what makes boys more motivated and engaged,” says Dr. Plesca, who notes her own son struggled in the school system compared to her daughter. “I don’t think that girls perform better than boys once they graduate. I think they perform equally well. But K to 12 shows them [girls] as performing better because it rewards certain skills: They’re more organized, they’re more disciplined, they pay more attention.”\nExtensive research on gender, mobility and college attainment support Dr. Plesca’s suggestions. In their report entitled The Secret Behind College Completion, published by the U.S. think tank Third Way, Dr. Buchmann and Columbia University professor Thomas A. DiPrete suggest that “because boys’ academic deficit is well established by middle school, reforms targeting the early and middle school years offer the greatest potential for closing the gender gap in college completion.”\nThe report goes on to say that a student’s academic future can already be forecast by the time they hit middle school, based on key indicators.\n“We found that eighth grade grades are a very strong predictor, using nationally representative data, of the likelihood of persisting in college and getting a college degree,” says Dr. Buchmann. “These things start earlier than perhaps some people think.”\nDr. Buchmann also suggests there could be more teamwork between high schools and postsecondary institutions, to help bridge the gap for students who are on the fence.\n“Colleges can do things like having summer preparation programs, or more collaboration with high schools,” she says. “Maybe take a class at the college level while they’re in high school and explore it.”\nIn light of widespread funding issues in North America and beyond, there are no strong indications that postsecondary institutions are interested in addressing the gender gap. To do so could be construed as discriminatory, argues Dr. Plesca.\n“What are we going to do, put quotas?” asks Dr. Plesca. “If we put quotas, girls are going to sue us; if according to the admission criteria women look better than men, women might say, ‘No, this is discrimination.’ So, it’s a very slippery slope.”\nDr. Buchmann predicts the financial pinch currently being faced by U.S. colleges, partly due to declining enrolment and rising operating costs, will drive postsecondary institutions to offer more variety.\n“Universities here [in the U.S.] are grappling with just how to stay in business, many of them; a lot of universities will probably fail in the next decade in this country,” she says. “So [they will need to consider] creating new programs, creating new certificate kinds of programs or new things that don’t require four years.\nThe hope, says Dr. Buchmann, is that these efforts will be enough to better engage male students.\n“We need men and women in all of the fields that make up a healthy society and economy.”\nSonia Mendes\nSonia Mendes is a freelance writer and editor based in Ottawa.\nTags\nMale enrolment\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(2 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Enrolment numbers for male students in post-secondary have been comparatively low for years! None of this is news. We kept telling our boys that they are not good enough because they underperform and underachieve; therefore we have raised men who shrug their shoulders in resignation. We cannot plant peas and reap corn! Haven’t we  as a society reaped what we have sowed?\nReply\nLorne Carmichael\nMay 1, 2025 at 10:00 am\nI published an article in University Affairs on Sept 1, 2015 related to this topic. It was entitled “Male – Female Imbalance in STEM Comes Down to Economics”. For some reason the search feature here does not seem to go back this far, but I can quote the final lines:\n“Current educational policies focus on encouraging girls in math and science. What if we put the same energy into helping boys do better in all the other subjects? This would increase the proportion of women in STEM by giving boys an alternative. At the same time it might begin to address the other major equity problem in our universities – the severe under-representation of males.\nSurely this is a policy we can all support.”\nWell, I guess I was wrong. Since then Jordan Peterson has been vilified for encouraging young men to grow up, many young women are finding it impossible to find a partner they can respect, and our equity professionals remain uninterested.\nReply\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMore from Features\nFeatures\nInternational students\nInside the life of an international student\nEvery day brings new adventures, challenges and opportunities for a student coming from abroad.\nby\nSelena Phillips-Boyle\nMay 26, 2025\nFeatures\nArts\nNew coalition forms to advocate for art and design universities\nIt’s time to shine light on the impact of art and design schools, say presidents.\nby\nHannah Liddle\nMay 14, 2025\nFeatures\nPolicy\nThe challenges facing Nova Scotia’s postsecondary institutions\nUnexpected government policy changes have choked off revenues while rising costs threaten to topple painstakingly balanced budgets.\nby\nAngela Mombourquette\nApril 23, 2025\nFeatures\nPolicy\nUniversities at a political crossroads\nCanadian universities are facing uncertain prospects as they weigh the\nLiberal Party’s mixed record on postsecondary education against\nConservative threats to EDI initiatives and research funding.\nby\nMohamed Berrada\nApril 16, 2025\nMore from Enrolment\nFeatures\nEnrolment\nWhy medical faculties are broadening admissions criteria\nUniversities across the country are tweaking their admissions processes to attract students from less-privileged backgrounds.\nby\nWendy Glauser\nMarch 04, 2020\nOpinion\nEnrolment\nWhere are all the international students universities were promised when Trump was elected?\nDespite a widespread media narrative claiming students would be flocking to Canada, universities did not see a “Trump bump.”\nby\nCreso Sá\nMarch 02, 2020\nNews\nEnrolment\nInternational student enrolment continues to soar in Canada\nDespite the success, the country’s universities look to diversify the source countries to avoid over-reliance on a few key nations.\nby\nMoira MacDonald\nMay 06, 2019\nThe University Affairs Newsletter\nKeeping Canada’s university community informed, inspired and connected\nEmail\nName\nThis field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.\n99743\nTopics\nAcademic freedom\nAdvice\nArtificial intelligence\nClimate change\nCopyright\nEquity\nIndigenous\nInternational students\nMental health\nResearch\nPublishing\nTeaching\nIn-depth\nFeatures\nNews\nArticles\nPeople on the move\nCampus Currents\nOpinion\nArticles\nSubmissions\nCareer Advice\nArticles\nSubscribe\nWays to subscribe\nPodcast\nRead the digital edition\nUniversity Affairs\nAbout us\nContact us\nAdvertise\nIssue archives\nJobs\nSearch Jobs\nUA Footer Symbol\nUniversity Affairs\nUniversity Affairs\nFacebook\nYoutube\nLinkedIn\nTwitter\nAccessibility\nCopyright\nUniversity Affairs Privacy Notice\n© Universities Affairs 2025.

Underlying much of its growth has been a simple problem with no clear solution: a drastic lack of permanent academic positions compared to the number of PhD graduates produced in Canadian universities. GPD programming now provides career support for PhD students that was often absent in the past, and it has undoubtedly aided many PhD students in preparing for the transition away from academia. The underlying problem, however, has not gone away, and neither PhD programs nor the job market show signs of adapting to accommodate the overproduction of PhDs. When it comes to facilitating career transition, have we reached the limit of what GPD can offer within the structural constraints of the university system and the Canadian job market? I pose this question as we enter a time of austerity for higher education in Canada, knowing that permanent academic jobs or postsecondary teaching positions of any kind will become increasingly scarce, and that broader economic troubles may also be on the horizon.\nGPD, from the beginning, has focused on skills rather than knowledge — the latter being the domain of the various academic disciplines. A key document in the development of GPD in Canada is the 2012 report prepared by Marilyn Rose for the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council in which she identified a need for training in transferable skills for graduate students, as well as for instruction on how graduate students can reframe their academic skills and describe them to potential employers. This focus on transferable skills and skill translation is now a key part of GPD.\nThe hard reality that this skills discourse continues to obscure, however, is that no student completes a PhD program for the sake of developing transferable or translatable skills. It is also not clear to what extent high-level academic skills — in critical thinking, deep analysis, knowledge synthesis, and similar — are transferable or translatable from one realm of knowledge to another, or if those gained from a PhD are that much different from those gained from a master’s degree once they are removed from a disciplinary context.\nThere are limits in the non-academic job market as well, which still does not demand PhDs. (The 2021 report by the Council of Canadian Academies, Degrees of Success, addressed this problem.) While PhD graduates are typically capable people who will eventually find decent work, we know that there are still few non-academic jobs that require PhDs or make full use of PhD-level academic skills. Certainly, there are none that provide opportunities for self-directed research of the scope and depth that is characteristic of academic research.\nSo is this it? Is this the best we can do? It may be all we can do as people working in GPD. There could, however, be something that disciplines can do by rethinking the purpose of PhD programs. By this I do not mean making PhD programs something different than what they have always been. What makes PhD programs important and worth keeping is not ultimately the skills they provide but the disciplinary knowledge they help create, preserve and transmit. PhD programs socialize students within an academic discipline and train them to be scholars. I suggest that instead of relying on GPD and the language of transferable and translatable skills to expand the definition of what PhD students can do, academic disciplines can work to expand the definition of what constitutes scholarship, who can carry it out, and where it should take place.\nWill professional academic research remain an all-or-nothing career option, confined to lifelong institutional positions accessible to comparatively few PhDs, or can it be somehow distributed among the vast numbers of PhDs whose knowledge and academic skills remain chronically underutilized?\nWe can encourage public scholarship — as GPD programs increasingly do — but for most PhD students, any skills they develop in this field will be put to use after graduation in contexts outside of the realm of specialized disciplinary knowledge. In the end, it is up to faculty to decide how to create sustainable futures for their disciplines and how society can harness the collective disciplinary expertise of the PhDs they have trained. I can only say that GPD and the skills discourse, however crucial they are for helping PhD graduates make the best of an unfortunate situation, will not be enough. We seem to have reached a limit, and the question is where to go from here.\nDavid Lafferty\nDavid Lafferty is a professional development coordinator\nin graduate studies at Carleton University\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(2 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

The research project itself should be what is funded on merit – we have to stop thinking of grants as propping up universities.\nReply\nValentina Galvani\nJune 4, 2025 at 4:45 pm\nGreat article. Three throughts.\n1. Faculty members in disciplines for which there is no obvious pathway to non-academic jobs could take a first step by being very honest with prospective students about the probability of entering academia after graduation. It is sad to see faculty members taking on Ph.D. students and advising them on topics for which they know there is no Plan B and no (or almost none) academic positions.\n2. Let’s not forget that there are students taking on the Ph.D. to facilitate immigration. For these students, point 1 above does not necessarily apply.

It looks like my institution is going to take advantage of the volatility in the U.S. right now by poaching one or more U.S.-based faculty. What do established researchers new to the Canadian funding environment need to know to be successful with the Tri-Agency?\n– Anonymous, Research Grants Facilitation\nA. In many ways, moving to an institution in a new country is like going back to school: there are new people, new systems, new norms, maybe even new words to learn.\nAnyone who is the first in their family to attend university knows about the hidden curriculum — the unwritten norms, values, behaviours, and expectations implicit within academia, distinct from disciplinary knowledge and methods. If you come from a family that has experience of university, you’re more likely to be equipped with the cultural capital necessary to navigate academic systems than someone who is a first-gen university student.\nAnd the hidden curriculum isn’t bounded to degree programs: it persists among faculty roles as well.\nFaculty members new to the Canadian funding system need to be aware of the presence of unwritten rules within the Tri-Agency. Consider, for example, equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI). I recently found myself reading the Canadian Council of Academies’ report Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion in the Post-Secondary Research System, and found myself disagreeing with some of its findings, including its claim that applicants to SSHRC’s Insight Grant (IG) competition “are not required to explain the relevance of EDI to research design and practice in their proposals, and evaluators do not take these considerations into account during the peer review process” (2024, p. 102).\nThe evaluation criteria for the SSHRC IG may not state that peer reviewers are scoring applicants’ integration of EDI, access, Indigenization, decolonization, and intersectionality in the design of their research projects and their plans for student training, but—contrary to the report’s assertion—these factors are indeed considered during the peer review process. Talk to any recent SSHRC peer reviewer and they’ll verify that for you. I advise the researchers who I support that peer reviewers do want to see, for instance, disaggregated data analysis and inclusive, culturally safe working and learning environments for all members of a research team. EDI is being scored, even though it isn’t mentioned explicitly in the IG evaluation criteria.\nBecause I’ve long wanted to see the unwritten rules of research grant applications written down, I’ve been interviewing former Tri-Agency peer reviewers. In January 2025, I shared a document called Peer Reviewers’ Perspectives: NFRF Exploration & Transformation; in the coming months, I’ll be publishing the parallel documents for the CIHR Project, and NSERC Discovery competitions.\nThis month, I’m focusing on the SSHRC Insight and Insight Development competitions. I interviewed 49 former IG and Insight Development Grant (IDG) peer reviewers from across all the review committees in these two competitions; this free 46-page PDF contains what I heard from these interviews. In my opinion, the real gems are in the details—but because it would take me 46 pages to convey those details to you, I’d like to highlight my four key takeaways:\nThe budget matters to the penny\nThe SSHRC IG & IDG peer reviewers pay a lot more attention during their scoring to the budget than do peer reviewers for CIHR Project and NSERC Discovery, with a good number of peer reviewers telling me that they see the budget as outlining what a particular project will ‘actually do.’\nSo, instead of saying that your flight to Toronto will cost $600, you should say that it costs $614 or $588—quote a number that shows that you looked up real costs and aren’t simply guesstimating.\nIn November 2024, I wrote an article outlining a three-part budget justification strategy that I recommend for SSHRC applicants:\nJustify why the expense is necessary;\nJustify where the numbers come from; and,\nJustify how the expense was calculated.\nThat specific article was written in response to an IDG applicant, but in truth I use this three-part strategy to explain budget expenses for all SSHRC competitions: the IDG, IG, Connection, Partnership—everything.\nYou need to apply to the right committee\nAt SSHRC, if you’re a labour studies researcher interested in the representations of care work in Belgian graphic novels published in the 1930s, it may not be clear to you if you should apply to the literature committee, the committee that includes gender studies, or one of the multidisciplinary committees.\nI’m always telling my SSHRC applicants to look up last year’s peer review committee members—Google them; find their bios—using the publicly published details on SSHRC’s Merit Review Committees page.\nBy looking up who has served recently on a specific committee, you can get a sense of the range of expertise, methods, and theoretical frames used by that group of peer reviewers. I find that researchers who gather this bit of extra data can make more informed choices than colleagues who are going only on the name of the committee.\nYou want to write meaningful, appropriate training and knowledge mobilization plans\nA lot of researchers who apply for SSHRC funding end up writing standard, conventional student training and knowledge mobilization plans. In the social sciences, students are supporting data collection and analysis, and then they’re co-authoring publications and co-presenting at conferences; in the humanities, the students are updating annotated bibliographies, and then they’re co-authoring publications and co-presenting at conferences. Across disciplines, researchers are promising to write journal articles or chapters for their monograph, to publish an edited collection or a special issue of a journal, to present at conferences, and to submit a piece to The Conversation Canada.\nSuch plans are fine—for many peer reviewers, they wouldn’t prevent a good project from getting funded—but in a tight funding climate, a compelling, original, feasible training or KMb plan that is well-suited to the project can help peer reviewers to distinguish between two otherwise excellent, important research proposals.\nIf you have a fascinating, important, feasible project, and someone else applying to the same committee has a fascinating, important, feasible project, AND a novel, compelling, feasible, appropriate, tailored student training or KMb plan, then they just might be able to eke out the extra point or half-point that they might need to lift their application just that touch higher in the committee’s ranking and thereby get funded over yours.\nHaving said that, it isn’t easy to come up with original, meaningful, feasible and novel ways to train students or share knowledge, especially if you’ve never engaged in original, meaningful, feasible and novel training or KMb in your own undergraduate or graduate degrees. Back in May 2024, I wrote about the University of Toronto’s novel ‘scholars in residence’ program for undergraduates; at UBC, the Arts Amplifier’s collaborative cohort projects offer paid work-integrated learning experiences to small groups of graduate students. If you do community-engaged research, could your RAs work for or with a partner organization for part of their training? Does your institution provide supports for experiential or work-integrated learning that could become a part of your student training plan?\nIf your institution has a strong program in communications, digital media, film, photography, or fine arts, you might be able to recruit talented trainees to support your knowledge mobilization plan—just make sure that there’s someone on the team who can provide them with discipline-relevant advice and feedback, so they’re both working and learning at the same time.\nWhen it comes to knowledge mobilization plans, SSHRC peer reviewers repeatedly told me that the plans must align with the project—there must be a clear and logical fit. If you’re a social science researcher who is using PhotoVoice for data collection, then consider finding a way to enable research participants to opt-in to sharing their photos through an in-person or digital exhibition. Doing so would fit with the visual aspect of your methodology. If you’re a humanities researcher, consider experimenting with the strategies outlined in my February 2022 article, “Against utility and instrumentalization: knowledge mobilization for the humanities.”\nIf everyone applying to SSHRC is making a website, publishing on social media, hosting a one-hour public talk, or writing an article in The Conversation Canada, what can you do that’s different, but that also feels integral to your proposed research? The answer to that question can be a difference-maker for applicants in that frustrating ‘fundable but not sufficiently highly ranked’ zone.\nImportantly, your novel student training or innovative knowledge mobilization plan needs to be feasible, which—for peer reviewers—usually means it’s something you’ve done before. If you’re proposing something new, consider bringing on a co-investigator or collaborator who can support your plans. Doing so will reassure your peer reviewers that you’re not risking drowning alone, overwhelmed by a situation you’ve never been in previously.\nBut that’s just the high-level overview. Different committees have differing expectations—you wouldn’t expect a reviewer in the fine arts to want to see the same things as a reviewer in business studies, would you? I conducted these interviews and am sharing these quotations in the hopes of getting more of the unwritten rules for Canadian research grants written down, spelled out, and made clear.\nIf you’d like, I can email you the full, free 46-page PDF Peer Reviewers’ Perspectives: SSHRC Insight & Insight Development Grant, along with the NFRF guide published earlier this year. I’ll also drop you a note when the parallel guides for the CIHR Project and NSERC Discovery are published in this column next month and the month after.\nI’m coming to Congress!

Instruction should be designed to reinforce this.\nBy\nLoleen Berdahl\nMay 23, 2025\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nPhoto by Mikhail Nilov\n0 Comments\nAcross the disciplines, be it through research papers, reflective essays, written exam questions, or other written artifacts, the act of student writing plays an important role in developing thinking skills. When students outsource their writing assignments to AI, this opportunity to strengthen thinking skills is lost.\nIn my last column, I wrote about the inevitable deskilling that will occur in the AI environment and the importance of proactively preserving “writing as thinking”.” In this column, I explain why I believe this is necessary and how we can do so.\nUnderstanding the connection between writing and thinking\nWhen we attempt to put words to a page, we surface our areas of confidence and confusion, identify the holes in our logics, and bring forward new creative ideas. As Dan Shipper writes, “a certain kind of thinking is only possible through writing. … When you turn the vast, interconnected network of thoughts, feelings, and ideas in your mind into a line of words, you find sequence, order, and story. You expose fallacy and fuzziness. … And writing doesn’t just tell you what you already think somewhere in the cobwebbed attic of your brain. It actively helps you to generate new—and better—thoughts and ideas as you do it.”\nResearch suggests that writing is tied to critical thinking (particularly inference and scientific reasoning) and, over time, changes how the brain functions. Simply put, we become sharper thinkers when we write and more skilled at thinking the more we practice writing. This risks being lost if students abandon writing in favour of AI.\nHow instructors can strengthen the connection between writing and thinking\nTo protect writing as a tool for developing students’ thinking, we must reconsider our teaching approaches. Here are ideas to start:\n1. Emphasize learning and thinking over the written artifact. The ‘products’ of writing are both the learning and improved thinking emerging from the research and writing process and the actual written artifact. We need to use assignment structures and weighting to prioritize learning and thinking,\nDesign assessments can include ‘thinking evidence’. Examples:\nHave students submit both a research paper and an accompanying reflection worksheet in which students answer specific questions. (Examples from John Warner: “What have you discovered that is new to you? What line, idea, or concept occurred to you while writing that you hadn’t planned on? … What do you know now that you didn’t know before?”)\nAccompany scaffolded assessments with a written or oral ‘thought evolution’ assignment in which students explain what changed in their thinking about the topic.\nLeading up to an assessment, have students submit journal entries describing their research and writing process, including what they are learning and how their thinking is evolving.\nUse assessment weightings to convey the importance of thinking and learning. Place high weight on the ‘thinking evidence’ and low weight on elements that can reasonably be done by AI (e.g., grammar, formatting, bibliographic style), unless those elements are an important learning outcome for your course.\n2. Be explicit with students about the linkage between writing and thinking. Ask students to discuss how they have experienced evolution in their own thinking through the writing process. Tell students about how writing improves your thinking.  Play them this short audio clip of Turing Award recipient Leslie Lamport arguing “If you think you understand something, and don’t write down your ideas, you only think you’re thinking.”\n3. Bring writing activities into the classroom. Use classroom activities to promote writing as thinking. For example, have students write their answers to a particular question for five minutes, and then discuss their thinking process with a classmate. The University of Waterloo Centre for Teaching Excellence’s Using Writing as a Learning Tool provides additional activities to consider.\n4. Provide students with writing study prompts.  Provide students with a list of short-answer and essay questions to practice as part of their exam preparation – even if the exam doesn’t include such questions. As Shane Parrish writes, “Writing is the process by which you realize that you do not understand what you are talking about. … writing about something complicated and hard to pin down acts as a test to see how well you understand it.”\nWriting as thinking: call to action\nPaul Graham argues that AI will lead to “a world divided into writes and write-nots. … Instead of good writers, ok writers, and people who can’t write, there will just be good writers and people who can’t write. …. a world divided into writes and write-nots is more dangerous than it sounds. It will be a world of thinks and think-nots.”\nI believe that as university instructors we have an opportunity and imperative to push against this. I encourage all of us to do so.\nContinuing the Skills Agenda conversation\nHow do you teach writing as thinking?  I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below.\nI look forward to hearing from you. Until next time, stay well, my colleagues.\nLoleen Berdahl\nLoleen Berdahl is a 3M National Teaching Fellow, an award-winning university instructor, the executive director of the Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy (Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina), and professor and former head of political studies at the University of Saskatchewan. Since 2016, Dr. Berdahl has spoken about student skills training and professional development at conferences and university campuses across Canada. Her research on these topics was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council Insight Grant program. Her most recent book is For the Public Good: Reimagining Arts Graduate Programs in Canadian Universities (with Jonathan Malloy and Lisa Young, University of Alberta Press 2024).\nTags\nTeaching\nwriting\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Let’s weigh the pros and cons.\nBy\nElizabeth Wells\nMay 09, 2025\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nPhoto by: Marko Pekic\nRead this article in French\n1 Comments\nAs we approach summer we are getting into “conference season” – a heady mixture of networking, socializing and of course disseminating our research.  You either love or hate conferences: seeing old friends and hearing about the latest scholarship or schlepping around exhaustedly to different locations for questionable value.  Either way, we have all been or are still on the conference circuit, and so in these economically challenging times it might be good to weigh the pros and cons of this kind of academic activity.\nConferences are particularly important for young scholars and graduate students; indeed you will find this makes up a rather large percentage of conference attendees today.  Scholars need to get their name out, get to know other scholars, and talk to presses and perhaps hiring committees.  As we age, we tend to do fewer of these and focus on publication, since once we are known in our field, we don’t need to show up to “perform” quite as often.  At the same time, conference attendance can be even more attractive and beneficial in a later career: a keynote or invited lecture is something that everyone likes to see on their CV.  There is also the series of social activities, ad hoc or planned, that happens at these conferences, and this can be one of the best benefits to our careers as well as our mental health.  Intellectual stimulation and social connection are important in our mostly isolating research lives, and so there is something very inspiring and invigorating to conference presentation and attendance, especially for people from small departments or small universities and independent scholars.\nHowever, conferences are expensive.  Anywhere from a few hundred dollars to more than $700 are typical costs for just the registration fees.  And then there are often add-on activities or dinners that can cost quite a bit, although they may enrichen the experience.  Banquets at conferences, often provided by corporate caterers, are heavy on the budget and rarely tasty.  Depending on who you are seated with, it could be the connection of a career or a boring wasted evening.  Airfares are exorbitant these days, and in places like New York City, where Airbnb’s were outlawed, the cost of hotels is also quite high.  Sharing a room with a colleague is one possible remedy, especially if it allows you to enjoy a bottle of wine in the room with a grad school buddy, but that is rarely the norm.  And then there are ancillary costs: transportation to and from airports and hotels, coffee and meals, and perhaps the cost of picking up a book at the book table (even on conference discount).  Depending on the location and length of the conference, this can add up to thousands of dollars for only a few intensive days of enjoyment and career advancement.  Not to mention that conferences take away your focus and energy at just the time of year when you want to get some serious work done.\nThe dilemma is that sometimes the most important events (getting a book deal, meeting a collaborator) can happen at conferences.  This has certainly been true for me.  But let’s look at what else you could spend perhaps $2000 to $3000 for an international conference on, if you skipped one such conference a year.\nBooks: From an average academic press, this could be 40 to 60 academic books.  Imagine how that would enhance both your library and your understanding of the field.\nTA or grading assistance: At $20/hour, you would have approximately 150 hours of extra TA or grading assistance, which is almost 12 hours a week for a 13-week term.  Many at large universities have teaching assistants provided from departmental budgets.  For those who don’t, this could be life-altering.\nPost-Doc: You don’t have to get a large grant or a full-time position to find a post-doc who is interested in providing support for your research on an hourly basis.  At $50/hour this would give you 10 hours a week for six weeks in the summer to have a colleague edit, do research, or otherwise support your scholarship.\nProfessional Development:  At costs of $150 and up per hour, you could work with an academic developmental editor or academic coach and improve your work/life balance, or develop your nascent scholarly ideas.\nVacation: Let’s assume you pay for a conference out of your own pocket.  This could get you well on your way to a getaway in the Caribbean or a cruise.  No tax deduction, but a relaxing and restorative trip.\nAlthough this all sounds good, I admit we don’t all have resources to spend on conferences.  However, imagine if we skipped just one expensive event per year and put the money toward any of these other worthy aims.\nWhile we never know when that wonderful opportunity or meeting will happen at a conference, or how it might launch a career – to a certain degree, it’s serendipity – I would suggest weighing your options.  If the attendees include a new body of scholars to you and your work is new or emerging, and your session is very specific, it is probably worth going.  If you are trying to get a book deal and can guarantee facetime with an editor, it is probably worth going.  As for online conferences?  I personally don’t like them because they offer none of the upsides with many of the downsides.  But they are convenient and often very inexpensive or even free.  My best advice is that reducing your live conference attendance by a certain percentage and diverting those funds in other directions (or saving it); you might end up on the winning side of the bargain.\nElizabeth Wells\nElizabeth Wells is a professor of music history and musicology at Mount Allison University as well as author of the book The Organized Academic.\nTags\nHiring\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

I want our campus to be a destination of choice,” she says. Her invitation to “join me,” expressed loud and clear in the days following her appointment, is an unequivocal call to those who wish to contribute to a socially engaged, inclusive and forward-focused university.\nThis warm, open approach builds on an outstanding career that combines laying down local roots and creating an international profile. A renowned interdisciplinary researcher, a graduate in law from the Université de Montréal, with a master’s and a doctorate (SJD) from Harvard, Sylvestre was dean of the Civil Law Section of the Faculty of Law and co-chair of the uOttawa Senate Committee on Academic Freedom. She’s also a member of the board of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the board of governors of the National Judicial Institute and the College of New Scholars, Artists and Scientists of the Royal Society of Canada.\nA vision to meet the challenges of our time\nFor Sylvestre, the University of Ottawa must be rooted in its milieu, engage in conversations with people, community partners, and public and private sector decision-makers, and meet community needs. She says that this calling is exemplified by the research currently being done at the University of Ottawa, which she calls “outstanding,” both for its growth and for its relevance. Health care, innovation, artificial intelligence, social justice, the environment: the great challenges of our time are at the heart of the research on campus.\nHer keen understanding of current issues — academic freedom, institutional autonomy, budgetary constraints — fuels her determination to combine academic ambition and responsible management. She thus intends to advocate for the University’s mission, while sustaining the research intensity that has made uOttawa’s reputation in Canada and around the world.\nAmbitious? Realistic and necessary for a president inspired by the power of the collective. Sylvestre sees the University as a focal point: a destination for knowledge, but especially for shared transformation for all. She believes that the University of Ottawa will continue to take its place as a driver of change by drawing on the dynamism of the university community and an influential network of partners.\nStrengthening partnerships, the Francophonie and Indigenization\nThree overarching priorities will shape the start of her term. Firstly, she wishes to strengthen links with the community. Mentioning the unique qualities of the national capital — a centre for policy-making, a diplomatic crossroads, a technological hub and a lively cultural space — Sylvestre sees it as an ecosystem that lends itself to enriching the university experience, stimulating research and innovation, and shedding light on society’s major debates. She also sees the future Advanced Medical Research Centre, as well as partnerships with the Kanata North tech park and affiliated hospitals, as opportunities to connect the campus to its locale.\nHer second priority is promoting the Francophonie in all its diversity and vitality. Sylvestre sees it as a focus of uOttawa’s identity and a concrete commitment. She would like the University to continue to fully serve Franco-Ontarians and play its role as a leader in knowledge promotion and research in French. A Quebec native and a Franco-Ontarian by choice for 20 years, she’s led several promising projects, including the French language certificate in Indigenous laws and the Jurivision.ca platform. For her, the francophonie is a driver of innovation, equity and collaboration.\nFinally, she plans to offer concrete, lasting support for Indigenous knowledge creation and languages. For her, this requires respect, listening and consistency. She would like to strengthen existing relationships with the Algonquin Anishinabeg nation, support Indigenous research, integrate Indigenous knowledge and languages in programs and encourage Indigenous representation and presence among professors and support staff.\nThese priorities set the tone for a strong focus on action as she starts her term.\nAmplifying a movement of ideas, action and innovation\nSylvestre invites researchers, public partners, innovative businesses, regional cultural and social leaders — and everyone else who want to think, build and act — to join with the University of Ottawa. She believes that uOttawa can build a world of possibilities that reflects itself — bilingual, inclusive, vibrant and firmly focused on the future.\n“Together, we will transform our university, our city, our country — and the world in which we live.”\nLolita Boudreault\nLolita Boudreault is the marketing content manager at the University of Ottawa.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

They reminded Dr. Tettey, who began serving as the university’s 17th president on New Year’s Day, of his own academic path — an irrepressible drive to use the post-secondary experience to shape a more equitable and sustainable future.\n“Students have always been at the heart of what universities do,” says Dr. Tettey, “and after spending a short amount of time with Carleton students, getting a feel for the work that is happening here, I can already see that they’re going to advance Canada and the world in new and innovative ways.\n“Our role as an institution is to nurture and cultivate ideas and people, but students are particularly regenerative. They come here with a broad range of experiences and challenge us to rethink how we do things.”\nAn inclusive entrepreneurial mindset\nDr. Tettey started going to school in a lower-class neighbourhood in Accra, the capital and largest city in Ghana — a place that many people consider the “margin of the margins,” he says.\nEven though his mother did not have formal schooling, she was a staunch believer in the power of education. Tettey had regular access to newspapers and the household was a vibrant gathering place for intellectual engagement with older siblings, cousins and friends who loved to debate, showing young Wisdom that curiosity and ideas could expand his world.\n“Education can open so many doors,” he says. “It’s one of those areas where you’re not encumbered by other people’s perceptions of what you should be. You might be sitting in a classroom with people who are economically better off than you, but what matters is your critical engagement with knowledge.\n“Coming to Carleton, I’m excited about helping to give people the chance to be in a space where we can grow to be our best selves and make valuable contributions to society.”\nDr. Tettey has promoted excellence at every institution that he has been part of over the years and notes that this outcome is deepened and expanded by a mutually reinforcing commitment to equity and inclusion.\n“There’s always an opportunity to learn and grow,” he says, “because you can always continue to push the boundaries of knowledge. But, more importantly, we can make a more meaningful and positive impact on society by intentionally fostering a learning and scholarly environment where excellence, equity and inclusion enrich one another.”\nThis approach to education, he says, should be one of the fundamental missions of universities, and the Carleton community’s commitment to it is what intrigued Dr. Tettey upon discovering that the university was looking for a new president.\n“I asked myself, is this a place where I can do the things that I believe in? Does it have the fundamental values and principles that undergird my own motivations?” The move to Carleton, he adds, was the result of a “bidirectional” decision making process.\n“There are tremendous opportunities for Carleton, and also an opportunity for me to continue to grow and contribute in ways that I might not have been able to previously. There’s a stimulating, enriching environment that I can draw from.\n“Relative to other places, Carleton is not as constrained by inflexible ways of doing things,” he continues. “It has a nimbleness, an entrepreneurial mindset and a spirit of innovation that are purposefully inclusive. I want to be part of this adventure.”\nMaintaining the momentum\nOne of Dr. Tettey’s priorities at Carleton will be to enhance the university’s renowned student experience, ensuring that the learning environment is as robust and supportive as possible.\n“We need to have the structures in place,” he says, “so our graduates can be conscientious and adaptable citizens and leaders, whoever they are and wherever they go.”\nAs a globally oriented institution, Carleton is well situated, Dr. Tettey says, to bring the world to campus, whether through research or partnerships or pedagogy. And the university is also poised to radiate out into other spaces to drive intellectual advancement, innovation and community impact.\nThis means, for example, leveraging Carleton’s location in the national capital to promote regional and international partnerships, including expanding the university’s presence in Kanata North, the largest research and technology hub in Canada.\n“These are the types of actions we can take to elevate our institution,” he says. “This is the journey that will lead to great outcomes for society.”\nAD\nAdvertisement\nDan Rubinstein\nDan Rubinstein is the senior writer at Carleton University and the author of Water Borne, forthcoming in June 2025 from ECW Press.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

S. President Donald Trump’s funding cuts and ideological crackdowns hammer American universities, many commentators see a moment of opportunity in which Canada becomes a destination for disaffected and defunded American academics.\nBut hang on just a minute before we roll out the red-and-white carpet.\nThe Americanization of Canadian higher education is already a problem; anecdotal evidence suggests that academics with PhDs from American institutions are often preferred by hiring committees over their Canadian counterparts.   Meeting the current crisis in the U.S. with calls to intensify this process risks entirely squeezing out Canadians from their own labour market. After all, unlike family doctors or nurses, we have no shortage of Canadian PhDs vying for Canadian academic jobs. As we all know, we have a shortage of academic positions, especially given the current widespread underfunding of our university system.\nIn McGill University’s Department of Anthropology – my doctoral alma mater – only one of the 16 full-time faculty members obtained his PhD in Canada. Its 15 other members all hail from doctoral programs in the United States, including from the University of Chicago, Harvard University, the University of California, Berkeley and Columbia University.\nThe situation at McGill is consistent with an analysis of Canada’s anthropology programs undertaken in 2015 by prominent Canadian anthropologists James Waldram and Janice Graham. Examining recent hiring patterns by focusing only on assistant professorships, they concluded that “two-thirds of Assistant Professors obtained their degrees from U.S. universities, and almost 80 per cent hold PhDs from a non-Canadian program.”\nNo systematic review exists to understand the current extent of the Americanization of Canadian higher education. Systematic analyses are often challenging to conduct, because it can be hard to see the provenance of professors:  Degrees are not always listed on academics’ websites, and CVs are not publicly available.\nHowever, my examination of several academic units at elite Canadian universities revealed results strikingly similar to Waldram and Graham’s conclusions. For example, the University of Toronto’s sociology department is the largest in the country, boasting more than 70 full time tenure-stream positions.  I was able to identify 57 faculty members who received their PhDs from the United States, five of whom had done their undergraduate degrees in Canada. On the other hand, there were only 10 faculty members who had obtained their PhDs in Canada, amounting to less than 15 per cent of the department.\nThe percentage I found at McGill’s sociology department was almost identical, with 16 faculty members holding PhDs from the U.S. (three of whom did their undergrads in Canada) and only three holding Canadian PhDs.\nI found similar results in many other academic units, although I only examined departments in the social sciences and humanities. Additionally, I found that hiring bias does not appear to be universal but more prominent in certain institutions and certain units, reflecting a deference to local culture. Numerous Atlantic Canadian universities, for example, appear to be entirely unaffected by it. Ontario universities appear to be more so. I also did not examine francophone Quebec universities which have their own cultural and linguistic dynamics.\nNevertheless, in examining different academic units and universities, two additionally troubling patterns emerged. First, academics holding Canadian PhDs were often the oldest members of the department, which suggests that hiring patterns have shifted and that Americanization is a more recently dominant trend.  Second, many Canadian PhDs appear to be hired because they work on topics specific to Canada that may have been integral to their job description. In other words, sociologists with Canadian PhDs focus on Canadian society, historians with Canadian PhDs on Canadian history, and political scientists with Canadian PhDs on Canadian politics, leaving world history, political theory, and international relations even more dominated by non-Canadian hires. The only areas that insulated Canadian PhDs from hiring bias were those where it would be hard to find any American candidate with an American PhD.\nMeanwhile, my non-systematic analysis found that while Canadian PhDs were far less represented in tenure-stream jobs, they were far more represented in teaching-stream positions, which generally come with less pay, less prestige and less job security.  In such a way, one could argue that Canadian PhDs are second-class citizens in their own institutions.  In an ironic gap between theory and practice, it appears that the more attuned a discipline is to questions of colonialism, imperialism, neoliberalism, inequality, and hegemony – disciplines like sociology, political science, history, or anthropology – the more likely it is to be dominated by Americans.\nWhat’s jarring about how American PhDs end up being prioritized over Canadians for academic jobs is that many Canadian academic job announcements come with a statement that “Canadians and permanent residents will be given priority.” In practice, this is easily circumvented because priority is trumped by the designation of the most qualified candidate. That is, as it should be, deferred to search committees and academic units. But as departments become more Americanized so do academic search committees, and it is not surprising that hiring bias accelerates and makes one question whether American professors in Canada with American PhDs really give any preference to Canadian PhDs for academic jobs. Certainly, the numbers I found suggest otherwise.\nRead the opposing view: American recruitment in the Canadian academy: The case in favour\nIt’s true that a minority of scholars with American PhDs are Canadian citizens and thus fit within prioritization of citizenship over academic pedigree. However, this still begs the question: Why even bother having PhD programs if we consider Canadian PhDs to be second-rate compared to American ones?   Over the years, I have had numerous conversations with ambitious undergraduates and MA students about applying to doctoral programs, and they invariably ask if they are going to be competitive on the Canadian academic labour market if they stay in Canada for their PhDs. Many do not want to leave but see no choice. They are acutely aware of existing hiring bias. It is sad that so many believe landing an academic position in Canada requires them to leave the country to the United States for a PhD, often taking Canadian scholarship money with them.\nThis is not a nativist argument. I write this as a Canadian citizen invested in this country. I also write this as an American citizen who arrived in this country for graduate school, obtained permanent residency status, and prioritized staying in Canada when I was on the job market. I’m also proud of our higher educational system and never considered my doctoral degree inferior to those of my American peers.\nA good argument exists for hiring scholars trained in Latin America, Africa, Asia, and, yes, the United States to represent a diversity of academic and global perspectives and a variety of intellectual traditions. But the current trend of Americanization of Canadian universities fosters less diversity and more intellectual homogenization. Having pockets of professors trained at the same schools invariably leads to less educational variety and misses out historically on how many major new ideas, scientific innovations, and breakthroughs have come from educational peripheries.\nWhat also gets limited are Canadian perspectives in classrooms while reproducing American culture-war debates that do not always have the same resonance in Canada. Americanization also jeopardizes the future of Canadian academic professional associations and the distinctiveness of, to cite my discipline as an example, Canadian anthropology. While many Americans assimilate to their new home, some keep a foot more firmly planted in the United States. After all, for some, Canada is a second choice after they have been unable to land work at home. Their personal, familial, and academic networks are entirely there.\nEven many of the most highly educated Americans know surprisingly little about Canada, often abstractly seeing it as a socialist paradise or merely a place to threaten to move to when Republicans are elected President.  Upon arrival, despite our not having the same deep inequalities as the United States, they confront our high housing costs and the major issues in our medical and educational systems. Lacking the resources of deep-pocketed American institutions with their huge endowments, expense funds, and subsidized housing, they also may find Canadian universities underfunded by comparison and perhaps less attractive than they had imagined in the abstract. One can cite numerous cases of American academics who come here at the start of their careers and then leave for more prestigious positions back home as quickly as they can.\nTrump’s trade war has unleashed a new nationalist sensibility in Canada and a desire to protect our identity and sovereignty. Maybe we should be applying this to our higher education system.  In the current moment, rather than encouraging more American academics, perhaps we should be better protecting made-in-Canada academic talent. Do Canadian universities have a responsibility to be Canadian?  We protect our media and cultural landscape from Americanization, so why not embrace similar protections in our higher educational system? These are not easy questions, but they need to be posed as the national character and independence of our academic system are in jeopardy.\nAri Gandsman\nAri Gandsman is an associate professor in sociological and anthropological studies at the University of Ottawa.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(9 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Apparently, the American bias that only their top ranked schools produce top scholars has crept north of 49° in some disciplines.\nReply\nTilottama Rajan\nMay 22, 2025 at 9:34 pm\nYou are absolutely right. I saw the change in the first year committees were allowed to consider non Canadians in the first round alongside Canadians. I’ve been told by a senior colleague at Toronto that Americans control hiring committees and hire their own. An ABD from a.US university is better than a Canadian PhD –my student — with an accepted book\nWe should not make this colonialism worse\nReply\nRyan Dunch\nMay 22, 2025 at 10:19 pm\nThe corollary to this is that we need to keep our PhD programs strong in Canadian research universities, in every field in which we employ faculty members. That means faculty renewal, along with investment in and prioritizing of graduate degree studies. Not just in STEM. Not just in the “big three” cities. Yet our provincial governments are not seeing this as a funding priority, and public support for the post-secondary sector is also not robust. How can we rebuild support for post-secondary education as a vital element for Canada to thrive?\nReply\nDre Gabrielle Saint-Yves\nMay 23, 2025 at 7:54 am\nJ’ai trouvé votre article très bien documenté.

However, there is more to consider than where the candidate was trained. In particular, there are many people who originate outside of the US who got their PhDs in the US. This might be an excellent source of scholars with diverse backgrounds, especially as Trump seems determined to equate every person of colour as a “DEI hire”.\nOf course, none of this matters if Canada can’t get its act together regarding housing.\nReply\nFrances Sharom\nMay 23, 2025 at 10:05 am\nThis hiring bias may only be true in the humanities and social sciences.

Recruitment of Americans in the Canadian Academy: The Case Against. There is every difference between luring laid-off American academics to Canada and bringing back some of the many thousand Canadian academics who work in the US because there are few academic jobs in Canada. There is also every difference between having an American PhD and being American. One-quarter of the graduate students at Harvard are, or were, international and it is a good thing, not a bad thing, for many of the the best Canadian graduates to go to a top-tier school in Europe or the US for their PhD work.\nReply\nStephanie\nMay 23, 2025 at 1:33 pm\nWe just published a study looking at hiring in Canadian psychology professors from 2012-2022. We found a significant difference in hiring American trained professors in universities with medical schools vs. comprehensive and undergrad only.  McGill was probably the worst. Zero Canadian trained hired between 2012 and 2022 from our search.\nhttps://psycnet.apa.org/record/2026-12949-001\nReply\nMike Wirth\nMay 28, 2025 at 1:26 pm\nThe problem is in part due to too few academic jobs in Canada. This is in due to the faculty demographics being bias towards older academics. The ages 50-64 make up some 43% of total academics, with another 12% above 65. Those under 40 make up a paltry 15%. This is very telling, and likely the reason why domestic students can’t be bothered with going on to do a PhD – too few jobs in academia (or anywhere else honestly). It’s a lot of time and effort put into a degree that won’t get you a job in academia. So fewer jobs mean that hiring committees tend to gravitate towards those applicants who fit the criteria well, and in reality (especially in STEM), this tends to mean (i) publication record, (ii) previous grants, (iii) PhD graduating university. American scholars tend to fit this criteria well, partially due to better access to grants (until recently). Having said that, I have also noted that sometimes there seems to be a bias in hiring practices with good Canadian candidates often given 2nd-tier “teaching-track” positions. Perhaps we value the contribution of American academe too highly in global higher education? Why do we not hire academics with degrees from more diverse regions of the world? Why do we put so much emphasis on having Phd graduate students when they have so little chance of securing a job in academia?\nReply\nReply to\nCancel reply\nEnter your comment here\nYour name(required)\nYour email address (required)\nWebsite (optional)\nYour email will not be published.\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\nMost popular\n01\nOpinion\nResearch\nCancelling in-person Congress wounds humanities research\n02\nCareer Advice\nAdvice\nSSHRC Insight and Insight Development Grant\n03\nCareer Advice\nPolicy\nThe limits of graduate professional development\n04\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\n05\nNews\nData vs MAGA\nAD\nAdvertisement\nUniversity News and Careers\nSubscribe\nAD\nAdvertisement\nFlight 302\nAD\nAdvertisement\nMeet Marie-Eve Sylvestre, the new University of Ottawa president who sees a world of possibilities\nFeatured Jobs\nEducation - (2) Assistant or Associate Professors, Teaching Scholars (Educational Leadership)\nWestern University\nVeterinary Medicine - Faculty Position (Large Animal Internal Medicine)\nUniversity of Saskatchewan\nPsychology - Assistant Professor (Speech-Language Pathology)\nUniversity of Victoria\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Cybersecurity)\nUniversity of Regina\nComputer Science - Assistant Professor (Master of Data Analytics)\nUniversity of Niagara Falls Canada\nView all jobs\nMore from Opinion\nOpinion\nResearch\nCancelling in-person Congress wounds humanities research\nBudget squeeze and logistical complexities leave the century-old conference without a host.\nby\nMichael Holden\nJune 10, 2025\nOpinion\nMental Health\nNo student is an island\nImproving the collective environment benefits students’ mental health.\nby\nJustine Pineault, François Lauzier-Jobin & Martine Shareck\nJune 06, 2025\nOpinion\nStatus hunt drives U.S. recruitment\nPrestigious American universities have long exerted a gravitational pull on Canadian academia.\nby\nFrancois Lachapelle and X.

It has frozen or threatened to withhold federal research funding from more than 60 institutions — including Harvard, Columbia and Princeton — unless they dismantle equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) offices, eliminate programs it deems “ideological,” and submit to direct federal oversight of curricula and student organizations.\nAlthough EDI has been the primary target, attacks on other aspects of academic life and research have quickly followed. New federal actions invoking antisemitism, foreign funding “transparency” and climate research oversight have introduced fresh channels of pressure, each carrying the same message: comply, or lose funding. The effects are already visible. Princeton lost $4 million in grants related to climate change research. The University of Michigan preemptively shut down its central equity office and a reproductive-health grant panel. Columbia has yielded to pressure, while Harvard is taking the federal government to court after $8.9 billion in federal contracts were frozen.\nThe consequences extend beyond American citizens and institutions. According to an Associated Press review, more than 1,000 international students at 160 U.S. universities, including The Ohio State University, have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March. Some reportedly lost their status due to their political speech and activity.  Some reportedly lost their status due to their political speech and activity.\nRestrictions are affecting academics abroad as well. Scholars who plan to present research in the United States are being questioned at the border about their political views. In one case, a French scientist was denied entry due to criticism of Trump’s policies posted online. In today’s climate, being a foreign-born academic with an opinion that doesn’t toe the MAGA line can feel like checking every box on a Trump-era watchlist.\nUnderstandably, many scholars are anxious. Some are unsure if they’ll be allowed to return to the U.S. after a research trip abroad or a visit home. Others worry their research funding might disappear with little notice. And some face the very real prospect of deportation to countries where they could be at risk of persecution.\nCanada is already seeing the consequences. Reuters reported a 27 percent increase in U.S. graduate student applicants to the University of British Columbia. Other Canadian universities, including Toronto and Waterloo, have reported spikes in web traffic from the United States. The Financial Times recently noted that several prominent academics, including Yale professors Jason Stanley, Marci Shore and Timothy Snyder, are relocating to Canada.\nSome Canadian institutions have begun to respond. UBC has temporarily reopened graduate admissions and introduced a fast-track process for American students facing disruptions.\nFaculty members across the country are stepping up — reviewing application materials, waiving language tests and circulating emergency funding opportunities. These are meaningful efforts, but without broader coordination, they remain piecemeal.\nWhat’s needed now is a national strategy. Canada should establish a clearing house for transfer procedures and immigration guidance; offer emergency fellowships to students and postdocs whose funding has evaporated; negotiate tuition waivers and credit-transfer agreements with American universities to keep academic progress on track; provide assistance with relocation logistics; and build partnerships to connect displaced scholars with Canadian researchers, preserving research collaborations that might otherwise collapse.\nOrganizations like Universities Canada, the Canadian Association of University Teachers, and the Tri-Council funding agencies could take the lead. Academic associations, such as the Canadian Political Science Association, could offer field-specific mentorship.\nSome might ask: why should Canada act, especially given Trump’s attack on Canadian sovereignty? Two reasons stand out — one moral, and one strategic.\nFirst, there is a moral argument. Academic freedom is not the exclusive domain of any one country. When it comes under threat, it is incumbent on the broader scholarly community to respond. Canadian universities pride themselves on their international outlook. This is a moment to demonstrate that commitment — not just by welcoming researchers fleeing repression in distant countries, but by supporting those targeted by political crackdowns in the United States.\nRead the opposing view: American recruitment in the Canadian academy: The case against\nSecond, there is a pragmatic case. The United States has historically been a magnet for research talent. If leading scholars no longer feel secure working there, Canada stands to benefit — particularly as the federal government seeks to grow its innovation and research sectors. Canada could attract highly skilled academics at a time when its own universities face increasing global competition for top talent.\nBut time is short. In some cases, funding freezes arrive at university departments with 30 days’ notice. Visa cancellations come with none. For those affected, decisions must be made quickly — often with families, research agendas and entire careers on the line.\nI write this as someone who owes a great deal to Canada. I completed my master’s degree at McGill University and earned my PhD at the University of British Columbia. My graduate and postdoctoral research were supported by Canadian taxpayers through SSHRC grants. Canada is where I became a scholar, and I remain deeply grateful.\nCanadian universities have a strong global reputation. Now is the time to match that reputation with action. By stepping up, Canadian institutions can send a clear message: that academic freedom matters — and that those forced to choose between their conscience and their career will find a place, and a future, in Canada.\nDominik Stecuła\nDominik Stecuła, PhD is an assistant professor of communication at The Ohio State University.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Neuroinclusive policies and practices can promote student retention and success, says the report, but they need to be integrated and centralized.\nCreating Inclusive Campuses: Neuroinclusive Policies and Practices in Post-Secondary Education examines the experiences of neurodivergent students in Canadian postsecondary education and provides recommendations for how institutions can improve neuroinclusion on their campuses. “There’s a need to focus on individuals but we also need system change,” said Jennifer Fane, lead research associate with The Conference Board of Canada and the report author. There has been an increase in inclusive pathways into postsecondary and institutions are offering accommodations but “there are these persistent barriers that students are encountering,” she said.\nThe report draws on the first national survey of neurodiversity in Canadian postsecondary education, which invited students who identify as neurodivergent (either due to a formal diagnosis or self-identification) to participate. Neurodivergence is a non-medical term that typically encompasses conditions such as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, learning disabilities and other neurological differences. The survey included 400 neurodivergent postsecondary students and recent graduates, as well as 78 interviews with neurodivergent students, recent graduates and staff and leaders working in accessibility services. The report is the second in a series, following a November 2024 report on the quantitative survey data.\nThe more than half of responding students who reported not disclosing their identities or diagnoses to their institution cited barriers that include challenges with diagnosis, disclosure and registration, inflexible processes and timelines, and fears of stigma and discrimination. Implementing mandatory neurodiversity training for all campus employees and integration of accessibility into institutional equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) strategic planning and policy development top the report’s recommendations. “All Canadian institutions are focused on EDI,” said Dr. Fane, but “it really has not included people with disabilities and neurodivergent individuals”. The report found that staff and leaders who reported neurodiversity was adequately being addressed in their institutions indicated that there had been a focus on accessibility within policies. The institutions had expanded the traditional EDI framework to EDI-A (equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility) or IDEA (inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility). Integrating accessibility into EDI would also provide a focus on measuring impact and growth, said Dr. Fane – a component that is currently lacking.\nIt is estimated that anywhere from 10 to 20 per cent of the population is neurodivergent, but there is no clear data on the number of neurodivergent students in Canadian higher education. This “huge gap” in data is what makes the report important, said Carly McMorris, associate professor at the University of Calgary and a member of the project’s research advisory committee. “This report is really highlighting the need across neurodivergent areas,” said Dr. McMorris. “Although I’m very focused on supporting individual needs,” she said, “I also recognize how our campuses are not neuroinclusive, meaning that it’s not just up to the neurodivergent person to be able to survive in postsecondary, but rather it’s up to neurotypical folks to provide an environment that’s neuroinclusive.”\n“This is a group that is in high need of support and it hasn’t been something that institutionally, I think, across Canada has been recognized,” said Dr. McMorris. She said that the report’s recommendations around the need for wraparound services, training for faculty and staff and establishment of low-sensory spaces could help students thrive. This report “is probably one of the most influential policy pieces that will move things forward in this field,” she said.\nWhile the report provides actionable items, Dr. Fane recognized that this is happening at a time when many postsecondary institutions are struggling financially. In their interviews, they talked to 30 accessibility services across Canadian colleges, polytechnics and universities, and all reported growth in the number of students accessing services. “They’re not really able to expand services to meet the needs that actually exist in the population without a really different view on it.”\nDr. Fane said that the University of Calgary has been a “standout” in this area with their Neurodiversity Support Office which provides an example of how services can be centralized and integrated. Another example is Kwantlen Polytechnic University’s All Citizens Pathway. Spearheaded by Fiona Whittington-Walsh, professor of sociology and lead advisor on disability, accessibility and inclusion at KPU, the program integrates students with intellectual and/or learning disabilities into undergraduate, for-credit classes. Instead of individual accommodations, courses are designed to be inclusive and accessible. “Everybody in the class has access to the same supports,” said Dr. Whittington-Walsh. “They do not need to get any kind of academic accommodations because the philosophy is that we build all of this accessible design into our teaching and into our practice.” Based on the foundation of Universal Design for Learning principles, the program uses what Dr. Whittington-Walsh calls “critical disability pedagogy”.\n“There are lots of examples of great practice and more and more I am seeing really game-changing things happen, but the progress is just really slow,” said Dr. Fane. “What the research has tried to do is make sure that individuals know more about how they can navigate the system better, the types of evidence-based strategies that might work, but then we also just need the systems to do their jobs so that the individuals are having more success with those strategies.”\nOther recommendations in the report include:\nAddress misconceptions about accommodations among faculty members through training on legal obligations, standardized processes, guidance and a formal process to address instances where a student’s right to accommodations is not being upheld.\nInclude neurodivergent students, staff and faculty in policy-making to enhance institutional neuroinclusivity.\nCentralize neurodiversity supports to ensure coordinated access to accessibility services, mental health services, support programs and other services.\nProvide neurodivergent students with targeted information relevant to their learning and cognitive profiles, as well as available services and supports, to help them develop their self‑advocacy skills.\nIncrease flexibility in institutional processes, including early access to course details and lengthened drop/withdrawal timelines, so that students can make informed decisions about course suitability.\nSet measurable outcomes to track progress and ensure accountability.\nSparrow McGowan\nSparrow McGowan is a freelance journalist, writer and editor based in Ottawa.\nTags\nNeurodiversity\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

But despite interest from certain students, no French-language university in Quebec has signed on\nIn an ideal meritocracy, a person’s skills would be enough to progress their career. The Scarborough Charter is the result of a series of nationwide inter-institutional consultations to eliminate inequalities disadvantaging people of African descent in higher education.\nParticipating universities have customized the action plan set out in the 20-page document with the goal of identifying and dismantling discriminatory barriers in their institution on an ongoing basis. By signing the charter, universities join a coalition in which participants analyze collected data and share insights to advance the inclusion of Black staff and students on campus.\nAfter learning about the charter, Sarah Vuka Makani, president of the independent Organisation des étudiant.e.s noir.e.s de l’Université de Montréal (Organization of Black students at Université de Montréal—ODENUM), said she was hurt that Université de Montréal (UdeM) had not signed it.\nUniversities have a “duty to protect” all students, she said. “It’s as though they’re sweeping [anti-Black racism] under the rug and saying we’ll deal with it later. But the real question is when exactly is ‘later’?”\nEquity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) measures on campus and in society at large have helped Ms. Vuka Makani deepen her own understanding of structural inequalities.  Microaggressions, discrimination, everyday and color-blind racism, misunderstandings, and (un)conscious biases are “a lot to process,” said Ms. Vuka Makani.  “It’s a constant feeling of insecurity,” she added. “Sometimes it’s not until later that we realize [we’ve experienced racism].” And while this can stir up painful emotions, it also strengthens her commitment to her organization.\nAs someone committed to defending Black students’ interests between student duties, she believes the refusal to adopt the Scarborough Charter penalizes her community.\n“Recognizing anti-Black racism entails making a commitment,” argued Myrlande Pierre, vice president of Quebec’s commission for human rights and youth rights. Though the Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms identifies all human beings as equal, Ms. Pierre points out that some groups still experience various forms of discrimination across civil society.\nIn Quebec, Premier François Legault continues to deny the existence of systemic racism and has rejected several reports finding that Black people are racially profiled across public, professional, educational and medical spheres. This denial has notably been denounced by Amnesty International (French only).\nA French-language survey conducted this spring by the research firm Léger and the Observatoire des communautés noires du Québec (Observatory on Quebec’s Black Community) revealed that 66 per cent of Black people between the ages of 15 and 34 report having been treated unfairly by provincial and federal public services. Meanwhile, only 19 per cent of non-Black youth reported the same experience.\nIs EDI just an idea ?\nQuebec’s English-language universities, Bishop’s Concordia and McGill, signed the Scarborough Charter when it was introduced. French-language universities have yet to do so. The lack of institutional transparency troubles Ms. Vuka Makani. No matter what universities ultimately decide, she thinks they could at least notify students.\nUniversité Laval (ULaval), Université du Québec en Abitibi-Témiscamingue (UQAT), and HEC Montréal agreed to speak with University Affairs about their reasoning behind not adopting the charter.\nThough these institutions share the charter’s values, their representatives acknowledged that recognizing anti-Black racism through the charter poses other challenges. The relatively low Black student population at UQAT—about 400, or 10 per cent—and the budget committed to Indigenous reconciliation has limited the institution’s positive response to the charter.\nUQAT president Vincent Rousson said the university chose not to sign the anti-racism charter because its implementation would have required significant additional resources and created overlapping policy structures. Instead, the institution opted for a more holistic and regionally grounded approach to EDI—one that includes strong commitments to Indigenous communities.\n“We had already made collective decisions with our regional partners, including First Nations,” Dr. Rousson explained. “Implementing the charter would have forced us to divert resources away from those priorities.”\n“At a certain point, choosing one thing means giving up another,” he added, noting that limited budgets require difficult decisions.\nULaval, which has about 1,500 Black students, or 25 per cent of its student population, was in the early stages of creating its EDI policy as the charter was being created. Committing to another long-term project at that stage would have been “very restrictive,” said ULaval’s EDI officer François Gélineau.\nAll three universities have developed custom internal EDI action plans to foster respectful intercultural relations and eliminate racism, injustice and discrimination. But EDI advocates say these general policies often fail to clearly acknowledge the implicit nature or severity of the discrimination levied against people with certain attributes or from certain ethnic origins, or the complexity of their intersectionality.\n“We take sexual assault very seriously and have held mini workshops on the subject,” noted Ms. Vuka Makani. “It would be nice to hold workshops about racism, too.”\nIn Montreal, HEC Director Federico Pasin said he is “ambivalent” about adopting some of the actions suggested in the charter for fear of allegations of favoritism toward Black people at the expense of other minority groups. Mr. Pasin, who was not aware of the Scarborough Charter before being contacted for an interview, said he finds the data aspect of the charter compelling.\n“People have biases. People of color are disadvantaged as a result. But are Black people really more disadvantaged than others?” he voiced during the interview.\nThe inequalities experienced by people of African descent are not unique to Quebec or Canada, Ms. Pierre pointed out. Anti-Black racism is a common historical legacy of colonialism that generates both intentional and unintentional stereotypes “still very much alive in the collective imagination.”\nEven “talking about anti-Black racism is not something everybody wants to do,” said Ms. Vuka Makani. “It’s uncomfortable. But sometimes discomfort wakes people up and triggers change.”\n*Editor’s note: When University Affairs reached out to Université de Sherbrooke, École de technologie supérieure, Université du Québec à Montréal, Université de Montréal, and Polytechnique Montréal, they directed us to their EDI practices.

We are not keeping up with other countries, particularly the United States, our largest trading partner. We are at risk of falling further behind as the global economy is upended by the U.S. focus on growing its own domestic manufacturing and technology industries through subsidies, tariffs and reshoring initiatives.\n“Elbows Up” may be a good slogan for an adrenaline rush. However, if we fail to turn this period of adversity into a long-term advantage, the economic impact to our country will be felt by generations to come. We require a bolder, integrated strategy involving governments, industries, and our world-class universities that attract and develop top talent.\nFirst, Canada needs a more tech-savvy workforce, which means training more people in artificial intelligence, data science, and other advanced skills. One of Canada’s greatest weaknesses is that businesses are slow to adopt AI, automation and cloud-based systems, not due to lack of awareness but because they do not have enough skilled workers to use and leverage these tools. We know what we must do, but not how – universities as partners is an answer.\nThe Vector Institute’s 2024 report on emerging AI skills identifies a pressing need for workers with specialized expertise in areas such as machine learning, data engineering and cybersecurity. Digital literacy needs to be a core skill for students at all educational levels, from K-12 and throughout higher education. Industries should be involved in developing curriculums and offering real-world learning opportunities. In today’s economy, we do not just need more people who can write code, we need people who can understand the societal implications of AI, who can design ethical business models, who communicate across sectors, who can connect insights from science and the humanities into solutions. That is what a university education, done right, is built for.\nWe need to broaden our definition of “tech-savvy” so that students and workers can use technology effectively. Humanities, critical thinking and analytical writing skills need to be integrated into tech training to solve the big problems of today and tomorrow.\nSecondly, our universities and industries need to collaborate in areas where Canada has an advantage: critical minerals, the Arctic economy, foreign policy, AI, agrifood, aerospace and clean energy, all come to mind. But above all we need to remember that we are a knowledge-based economy. We must build partnerships that help students gain practical experience and access new ideas. In other countries such as Germany and South Korea, schools and industries work seamlessly to turn research into real-world solutions and drive commercialization. Canada’s postsecondary institutions can do more to break out of our silos.\nEncouragingly, new models – beyond internships – are emerging. The University of Ottawa’s CloudCampus, launched in partnership with the Bell Canada company FX Innovation and CENGN (Canada’s Centre of Excellence in Next Generation Networks), offers graduate training in building cloud systems and retraining opportunities for mid-career professionals. The Creative Destruction Lab, founded at the University of Toronto and now operating at 12 sites around the world, is a global startup program for science-based companies looking for initial funding. At Victoria University, the Centre for Creativity convenes business, academic and creative industry thinkers to find answers to specific questions together.\nCanadian universities can and should lead the way in creating more of these partnerships. With their research capacity, teaching talent and deep community networks, they are uniquely positioned to build bridges between innovation and implementation. Where else in society can you find such deep and broad expertise in one place: scientists, engineers, artists, historians, ethicists, and economics, for example, all working side by side? This diversity of knowledge and perspective is the value universities bring to the table and which will be critical to solving today’s most complex challenges.\nThirdly, government support is vital. Canada must create a culture where innovation is not just fostered, but expected, both in classrooms and board rooms. Tax incentives, matching grants and streamlined funding applications can encourage more businesses to invest in collaborative research and development.\nUnless Canada modernizes its productivity strategy, we risk long-term economic stagnation. But if we can better connect education, industry and research, we will not only catch up with other economies but also create a stronger, more competitive future. It’s time to get our elbows up and all hands in — rolling up our sleeves not just to work hard, but to translate that work into building a strong, resilient economy for everyone.\nRhonda McEwen\nRhonda McEwen is the President of Victoria University in the University of Toronto and Canada Research Chair in Tactile Interface, Communication and Cognition\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Photo by: THE CANADIAN PRESS/Justin Tang\n1 Comments\nThe Liberal Party led by Prime Minister Mark Carney secured a fourth term in Monday’s election, bringing clarity to leaders in the postsecondary sector looking to chart a productive path forward with the new government.\nWhile higher education remained a backseat issue in an election dominated by the ongoing trade war imposed by U.S. president Donald Trump and the dual crises of housing and affordability, the Liberals have made promises with significant impact for universities\nChief among them is a $10 billion investment in building new homes, with $2 billion dedicated to student and senior housing. The new government further promises to invest in attracting leading researchers to Canadian institutions and to create a capstone organization for federal research funding to enable mission-driven research.\nGabriel Miller, president and CEO of Universities Canada (publisher of University Affairs) said his organization is eager to work with the new government to ensure it delivers on its commitments. Investments in student housing and strengthening Canada’s research ecosystem are welcome news, but he said the leading priority for the university sector is the urgent need to fix Canada’s immigration system.\n“It’s crucial that we sit down quickly with this government and restore confidence in Canada’s immigration system, because right now we’re losing people we’re going to desperately need to drive the economy,” said Mr. Miller.\nUniversities Canada, which represents 97 Canadian universities, will also be working to ensure ongoing promises by the previous Liberal government under Justin Trudeau are fulfilled. Central to those promises is a major injection of $1.8 billion in federal research grants of which 12 per cent has been disbursed since it was first announced in 2024.\nChad Gaffield, executive director of the U15, said that Canada’s leading research universities are ready to partner with the new government and that the prime minister’s election “comes at a time of real urgency to strengthen Canada as a resilient, secure and sovereign country.”\nFor many in the academic community, the new government has brought a sense of relief. Glen Jones, a professor of higher education at the University of Toronto, noted that the Conservative Party, which will remain as official opposition to a minority Liberal government, had been causing concerns with its rhetoric around “woke ideology” which could have implications for equity, diversity and inclusion policies and programs.\n“But more importantly, there were references to monitoring research activities and perhaps getting involved in interventions that would have direct implications for the autonomy of institutions and for academic freedom,” said Dr. Jones. “So I think there’s a sigh of relief about that policy platform and where it was going in terms of moving forward.”\nLinking postsecondary education to economic growth\nPostsecondary leaders communicated a sense of urgency to get to work with the new government as well as the importance of continuing conversations with policymakers from across the political spectrum.\n“We look forward to collaborating with the new government and with members from all parties to continue advancing education, research and innovation as pillars of Canada’s prosperity and leadership,” said Deep Saini, chair of Universities Canada and president and vice-chancellor of McGill University.\nThe election of the Liberal Party comes at an uncertain time for Canada and the global economy. Prime Minister Carney intends to eliminate trade barriers between the provinces and territories and build the “fastest growing economy in the G7,” among other ambitions. Postsecondary leaders say universities will be fundamental to driving that growth, and recognize they will need to move quickly to communicate to policymakers and the public how they can contribute to the Canadian economy.\n“It’s a critical time for us to show just how much we’re going to contribute to helping the country weather this storm and thrive in the long run,” said Mr. Miller.\nInternational education remains most pressing issue\nPrime Minister Carney has said he will maintain immigration levels, including caps imposed on international student visas first imposed by the Trudeau administration in January 2024. The policy change took the postsecondary sector by surprise leading to declining enrolment and severely reducing a major source of tuition revenue for universities.\n“At this point, the universities and colleges are far below the caps. In other words, there’s something about the brand of international education in Canada that has been negatively impacted by those 2024 decisions – and that’s bad for everyone,” said Dr. Jones.\nPrime Minister Carney has promised to invest $100 million over four years to attract leading researchers who have had their funding cut by the U.S. government. But Mr. Miller says more needs to be done – and soon.\n“The single area we have to make the most rapid changes in is our system for welcoming international researchers and students, which is too slow, too bureaucratic and simply not good enough to compete internationally,” he said.\nPrioritizing research and innovation\nBesides the incoming government’s promise of a $46 million investment into Canada’s AI institutions, research and innovation barely factored into the election. “We’re going through some sort of major economic transition, and research and innovation need to be in that same conversation,” said Dr. Jones.\nAccording to the OECD, Canada ranks the highest in public research and development investment but among the lowest in innovation outcomes such as technology adoption and, importantly, productivity growth – which is how countries raise citizens’ standards of living.\nPostsecondary leaders are pushing for a a more holistic conversation surrounding research and innovation.\n“It really starts by sitting down with everybody, with entrepreneurs, with Canadian businesses, with government, with universities, and asking ourselves how we make sure the benefits of our research to Canadians are maximized and amplified,” said Mr. Miller.\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(1 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

International students were also impacted, with their minimum tuition set to $20,000.\nIn his decision, Judge Dufour said the ministry failed to provide data supporting its assertion that out-of-province students were not integrating into Quebec society. The current fee structure will be maintained, however, with the ministry given a nine-month window to make amendments.\nThe French language requirement was invalidated immediately “given the near-certain impossibility of achievement,” according to the ruling.\nIncreases to international student tuition will remain unchanged. Judge Dufour deemed it reasonable for the province to want to balance funding between French and English universities as the latter attract more international students who pay higher tuition.\nHigher Education Minister Pascale Dery’s office did not respond to comment at the time of writing. The ministry has 30 days to appeal the decision.\nPhoto courtesy of: Concordia University\nMcGill, Concordia universities react to ruling\nThe regulations had followed months of negotiations between the English-speaking institutions and the province to find an agreement. By August of 2024, Concordia reported that the university’s out of province enrolment had dropped by 28 per cent.\n“Although I find little satisfaction in today’s decision – we were left no option but to challenge the government’s policies on legal grounds – I am reassured by the court’s findings,” said President and Vice-Chancellor Graham Carr in a memo to Concordia’s community members.\nThe president wrote that the university would continue to analyze the impact of the ruling on English-speaking institutions and the Quebec university network. He also reiterated Concordia’s “ongoing commitment to supporting our students’ efforts to achieve French-language proficiency.”\nA similar message was sent to the McGill community by President and Vice-Chancellor Deep Saini. McGill kept enrolment relatively stable – a drop of only 8 per cent in 2024 – by admitting more Quebec students and introducing a new scholarship to offset out-of-province tuition hikes.\n“McGill University remains firmly committed to playing an essential role in Quebec’s economy, talent pipeline, research ecosystem and to contributing to the promotion and validity of the French language,” wrote Dr. Saini.\nEtienne Paré, president of the Quebec Student Union, said he is not surprised by the decision and that the mandates had sent the wrong message about studying in Quebec.\n“The judge mostly said what we have been saying for a year-and-a-half, that the tuition hike made no sense,” he said. “The government is not sending the right message to people – if you want them to integrate more, if you want them to learn French, if you want them to become a part of Quebec society, this isn’t the way to do so.”\nMr. Paré said his union continues to oppose the tuition minimum for international students. “It’s not normal that we use international students to compensate for us because the government doesn’t invest in our universities.”\nHannah Liddle & Mohamed Berrada\nTags\nConcordia\nEnrolment\nMcGill\nPascale Déry\nPolicy\nQuebec\nQuébec\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

Why do you think this is taking place?\nThere are direct political attacks south of the border on equity, diversity and inclusion, or DEI in the U.S. We are seeing the political wind shift in Canada, too. I suspect some of our institutions are looking at how to confront this wave of authoritarian populism, ethnonationalism, or whatever you want to call it, so that we are not targets.\nThis has become a political power play in some ways, and the more cynical side of me recognizes that it’s a great fundraising tool for some political parties and that people write cheques on this issue – and that helps them.\nWhat critiques of EDI do you hear from your members?\nThere has been a tendency in some circles, under the broad umbrella of EDI, to call people out more than calling people in – so there is a kernel of truth to the notions of censorship or cancel culture. But I want to emphasize that these cases are rare.\nA point I hear often is that institutions have a surface-level approach to EDI – that it was about representation instead of changing the whole culture. It also became a very bureaucratic process.\nAnother concern is that we have an increasing number of precarious contract employees who were left out of the EDI conversation. That is a serious equity issue as well.\nWhat is your perspective on the position that EDI is at odds with ‘excellence’?\nI’m told by EDI critics that excellence should be the major decision-making factor for jobs, research funding and so on. When you take that argument to the extreme, they’re saying that in a perfect world we would have a professoriate that would mirror the general population or pipeline of graduate students. We would have research that would be funded across a whole range of issues. The fact that we don’t, according to this logic, seems to suggest they are arguing that certain groups aren’t excellent. I don’t buy that argument.\nIs there merit to the argument that EDI stifles debate on campuses?\nI know some argue that conservative voices are disproportionately absent within universities and colleges, but we should look seriously at our campuses – because I see a lot of diversity. When I have meetings with members, they certainly let me know that there’s a wide range of views across the political spectrum. I don’t see any real evidence that EDI has stifled any debate. It seems to me that there is robust debate going on.\nShould those working in positions to advance EDI be worried?\nPeople are nervous. But I am also a bit more optimistic in the sense that we have stronger institutions in Canada.\nEven though it has become politicized here, it doesn’t have the same vitriolic attention as the U.S., so I hope that there’s strong resilience here in Canada to push back against the counter offensive. If we step backwards, it will be less inclusive, less diverse and less equitable.\nHannah Liddle\nHannah Liddle is the assistant editor for University Affairs.\nTags\nEDI\nShare\nShare it with facebook\nfacebook\nShare it with twitter\ntwitter\nShare it with linkedin\nlinkedin\nShare it with copylink\nCopy Link\nJoin the conversation\n(0 comments)\nPost a comment\nUniversity Affairs moderates all comments according to the following guidelines.

It’s an “historic” milestone, said Denis Gros-Louis, Director General of the FNEC. This partnership strives to offer specially adapted university programs to Indigenous students. A business plan for the House of Knowledge will be submitted to Quebec’s department of higher education by 2027. “All Quebec’s universities were interested in partnering and contributing knowledge to the new institution from day one,” said Mr. Gros-Louis.\nGhislain Picard, former chief of the Assembly of First Nations Quebec-Labrador, noted in a statement: “The House of Knowledge is the result of the tenacity of communities to reaffirm their self-determination in education. It responds to a real need and will contribute to the trend of an increasing number of First Nations graduates observed in recent years. This project embodies the shared vision of First Nations to fully claim control over their education. Fifty years after the national policy ‘Indian Control of Indian Education,’ I am delighted to see this initiative take shape.”\nThe project aims to address educational deficits among Indigenous Peoples by improving graduation rates and increasing the number of qualified teachers.\nBuilding on the Regional Education Agreement\nIn July 2022, the FNEC signed a historic funding agreement with the federal government to address funding deficits for Indigenous schools that dated from 1996. “As our youth become more active and engaged, we noticed that our graduation rates were a bit behind,” noted Mr. Gros-Louis. “Our chiefs concluded it was time we ran our own higher education network.”\nFNEC is using its Kiuna Institution as a learning hub while they work on establishing research chairs and attracting experts over the coming years. As academic success rates rise among Indigenous students, the need for an entirely Indigenous university is more pressing than ever.  “The goal is to make university education accessible to First Nations students, whether in urban or remote communities, by benefitting from experiences of Quebec universities,” says Mr. Gros-Louis.\nThe First Nations university will be created in several stages based on three priorities identified by First Nations Regional Chiefs. The first is to quickly prepare students to enter the workforce, which requires the institution’s financial needs to be met within the first 18 months. The second and third are to align the university with First Nations values and traditions and consider how best to root it in their cultures.\nA survey is currently underway to identify the specific needs of individual communities, especially where workforce and training are concerned. Regional Chiefs are tasked with making decisions based on the anticipated knowledge and workforce requirements of the next 15 years.  “Healthcare and education are themes that often come up,” explained Mr. Gros-Louis, “as do language and culture. I also hear more and more about using and modernizing traditional knowledge to achieve food self-sufficiency and reduce remote regions’ dependence on the biofood industry.”\nThe plan also anticipates partnering with the Regroupement des centres d’amitié autochtones du Québec (Native Friendship Centres of Quebec). This association will play an important role in the project, especially in orienting First Nations students to university life and contributing to logistics and support, including housing and student well-being.\nAlthough the institutional board will be comprised of First Nations members with the aim of meeting the needs of Indigenous Peoples, the House of Knowledge will be open to all. In the 2000s, Mr. Gros-Louis also contributed to the creation of First Nations University of Canada in Saskatchewan where he managed the federal Indian land registry. Though he wasn’t present at its inauguration, he has visited it many times and followed the project closely. He noted that Saskatchewan’s example can inspire, but that First Nations in Quebec have totally different needs. “The project’s business plan has to be approved by the government,” he added. “Reports will be sent every six months to keep the Ministry informed and involved. The project is progressing well.

However, the question of whether to return to their home countries after completing their studies, in most cases, still remains to be answered. Some reasons are purely academic, others economic, and others political.\nUNITED STATES\nStudents are entitled to a seat at the governance table\nRachel B GoroshRather than an environment in which assumptions are made regarding students’ political affiliations and values, universities need to be places for students to develop agency to decide on their political beliefs and enjoy the freedom to learn, grow and potentially change their minds.\nKENYA\nStudent leaders often targeted in ‘rife’ online violence\nScovian LillianYoung women are often on the receiving end of online violence. As the 16 Days of Activism Against Violence Against Women and Girls comes to an end, two students, who have been victims of this form of gender-based violence, call on universities to do more.\nGLOBAL\nClosing the student representation gap in global education\nSebastian BergerWhile education workers, educational institutions and civil society have been well represented in the governance structures of international education, the democratic voice of secondary and tertiary student unions has been formally absent for decades. But there are good reasons to believe that is changing.\nGLOBAL\nOur climate is changing. So should our higher education\nEva PapanikolakiThis week sees the most significant political event for education in recent years: the United Nations Transforming Education Summit. Young people have fought hard for the inclusion of climate education and, hopefully, this will be visible in the results of the summit.\nLATIN AMERICA\nA more conscientious population? Higher education can help\nVictor LeonHigher education is not only about acquiring the skills to get a good job. It is about developing values, the maturity to accept other points of view and the will to solve problems – all of which are needed to build a more sustainable world.\nSOUTH AFRICA-GLOBAL\nWhat is causing international student visa-processing delays?\nOrla QuinlanInternational students in South Africa whose study visa applications are still pending were granted a blanket extension of their current visa status until 30 June 2022. If any of these applicants elect to abandon pending applications, they are allowed to leave South Africa by this date without being declared undesirable. But what is causing visa-processing delays?\nASIA\nStudents cannot underestimate their power to tackle SDGs\nYee Teng LowThe Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs have the power to unite people around a transformed future, but more young people still need to fully understand the true significance of the SDGs and they require support to reach out to their peers and to take action.\nASIA\nWhy people need to start early to address climate change\nWorawalun Yarn-arphaThe climate crisis that we are facing is bigger than all of us. But we all need to play our part, and education as well as government and the media need to make people feel that they can make a difference in whichever field they choose to work in.\nEUROPE\nEurope must be a safe haven for students and academics\nMatteo VespaStudents and academics fleeing Ukraine need support and help and student unions across the continent of Europe are mobilising – from providing practical help for Ukrainian and international students at the borders to offering support so they can continue their studies in new locations.\nEUROPE\nStudents need to be heard on European Education Area\nJakub Grodecki and Matteo VespaWhile the European Students’ Union welcomes some of the recent proposals on European higher education strategy, it wants to see stakeholders, including students, represented within the High-Level Group on Education and Training, and to see students involved at the national level, shaping governments’ positions on European Education Area issues.\nEUROPE-GLOBAL\nWhy Europe and the world need a ‘student at risk’ support scheme\nFrederikke Veirum Høgsgaard, Hector Ulloa and Matteo VespaFriday 10 December was International Human Rights Day and a fitting occasion to underline that students are a global social group with common interests who are often human rights defenders. We need an international students at risk programme to support students who are at the forefront of the struggle for democratic values and social justice.\nAUSTRALIA\nUnderstanding how to deal with my ADHD as a PhD student\nAmarpreet AbrahamStudents who are neurodiverse and-or suffer from mental health issues can succeed in their PhD studies if they understand how this affects them and develop strategies to deal with it. Getting a diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or ADHD helped me make sense of my own behaviours.\nASIA\nWhy the Bell Curve system for giving grades needs reform\nAida Murad, Haziqah Jefri and Phan Le HaMany universities, particularly in Asia, still grade students using the Bell Curve system, arguing that it prevents grade inflation. But this advantage is outweighed by its negative impacts in limiting innovation and motivation, failing to reward hard work, and discouraging teamwork and collaboration.\nGLOBAL\nCOVID-19: could the pandemic be an educational accelerator?\nDavid Kwame KumadorShould we look at COVID-19 as merely about intellectual loss or as a period of movement towards a way of educating people for a more sustainable world? The lessons learned could shape a generation of students, teachers, researchers, institutions and society as well.\nCHINA-UNITED KINGDOM\nHow COVID-19 holds a mirror to our societies’ problems\nJingwen Alice FanBeing a Chinese international student at a British university in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic and then undertaking a tortuous journey home to China via quarantine to see out the crisis provides an interesting perspective on our different societies’ approach to COVID-19.\nGLOBAL\nZoom, shut up and write: How PhD students cope amid COVID-19\nKimkong Heng and Daeul JeongThe coronavirus pandemic has had a huge negative impact on academics, including PhD and masters students, leaving them isolated, driving down their motivation and productivity. A new online initiative aims to break that isolation and could encourage greater international and cross-disciplinary collaboration.\nEGYPT-SOUTH AFRICA\nFrom prisoner to student – Hope in the life of a refugee\nAmir AbouelrousWhen I first arrived in South Africa from Egypt, I had a desire to study theoretical physics and become a motivational speaker. I eventually achieved my academic goal in a journey that was filled with both beauty and days of uncertainty, fear and depression. Fortunately, I had a few tools that helped me along the way.\nAUSTRALIA\nWhat it's like to be a student on the poverty line\nMark PaceNational survey findings showing that one in three students regularly miss lectures or classes to work validate the financial hardship that thousands upon thousands of Australian students experience every day, in what seems to be a perpetual war on young people.\nSOUTH AFRICA\nDefending the 'public good' in postgraduate studies\nThandokazi Silosini, Tebadi Bopape, Nelisa Khambule and Nnamdi NwaharaPostgraduate students in all disciplines have a vital role to play in contributing to the public’s understanding of the world and in tackling the complex challenges facing it. They also need to make sure they do not lose their commitment to knowledge as a public good.\nARMENIA\nStudents protest against extended military conscription\nMariam YevdokimovaStudents have been campaigning against new legislation on military service which forces them to serve an extra year if they defer to undertake their undergraduate studies, and prevents them from deferring until after completing postgraduate studies.\nPALESTINE\nAt university I could not escape the shadow of war\nMona JebrilA student from Gaza who gained a masters at Oxford and a PhD at Cambridge says in this time of growing conflict worldwide, if universities want to be truly international, they need to think more carefully about how they support international students from conflict areas.\nPALESTINE\nAt university I could not escape the shadow of war\nMona JebrilA student from Gaza who gained a masters at Oxford and a PhD at Cambridge says in this time of growing conflict worldwide, if universities want to be truly international, they need to think more carefully about how they support international students from conflict areas.\nZIMBABWE\nRobert Mugabe has gone, but our struggle goes on\nMakomborero HaruzivisheWe should celebrate the role of students in the democracy struggle in Zimbabwe, but also be aware that despite Robert Mugabe’s resignation as president there is still much work to be done. We want free education, grants, academic freedom and jobs when we graduate.\nEUROPE\nStudents should be consulted on the future of education\nHelge SchwittersThe latest meeting of European leaders proposed reforms to higher education to build a stronger Europe, but students need to be included in discussions that shape their education if we are to have an inclusive and democratic system, addressing the needs of vulnerable groups.\nAFRICA\nSelf-taught skills – A wake-up call for education systems\nBlessing Nemadziva Early specialisation in high school and formal support to identify individual strengths may be a good way of encouraging more young people to remain in the formal education system and pursue higher education qualifications.\nUNITED STATES\nUnited we stand – Student resistance to Donald Trump\nCasey O’BrienUnited States universities should support students in resisting the Donald Trump administration’s policies. Democracy is not a spectator sport.\nUNITED STATES\nStudents need to work before studying abroad\nCasey O’BrienStudy abroad works better when students are properly prepared, do their reading and understand a little about the complexities of where they are going.\nBULGARIA\nThe barriers to global exchange\nDenislav AtanasovWhy are Bulgarian students reluctant to take part in study abroad programmes? Lack of available information on the options is one big reason.\nSOUTH AFRICA\n#LanguagePolicy – Some languages more equal than others\nKitso RantaoThe distinction between race and language in South Africa is a fine one, and given historical racial politics the line is blurred in many places. Student protests against the use of Afrikaans as a medium of instruction in universities have sparked racial tension that cannot be categorised as strictly ‘black’ or ‘white’.\nSOUTH AFRICA\n#FeesMustFall – Demanding an affordable Bill of Rights\nKitso RantaoProtesting students achieved a 0% rise in tuition fees for next year. There are unresolved questions for the future but solidarity was able to secure our present. And we know we can be a ‘rainbow nation’ whose colours don’t only run parallel, but intersect to create a better country.\nGLOBAL\nOn becoming a global manager\nAnkit KhandelwalI have created a global managers training resource which takes a broad approach encompassing cultural issues and thinks a bit outside the box about what the new world of work needs.\nHONG KONG\nAn international student’s open letter to Hong Kong\nHiu M ChanBorn in Mainland China, a citizen of Hong Kong and now a PhD student in Britain, fundamentally I am an outsider. Perhaps I can see the big picture. As tension rises in Hong Kong between the Umbrella Movement and the government, it is time for writing.\nUNITED STATES\nStudy abroad – To change the world, know the world\nJalessa CaplesStudying abroad in Italy as part of a programme for first generation prospective university students gave Jalessa Caples a new perspective on her own country and culture and a greater confidence in herself.\nFINLAND\nWhy tuition fees for international students won’t work\nJarmo KallunkiThere are two main arguments for charging international students in Finland tuition fees, but both are based on fallacies. Indeed, charging fees may prove more costly than offering tuition-free education.\nEUROPE\nHigher education is about more than jobs\nNevena VuksanovicThe consultation on the European Area of Skills and Qualifications has highlighted concerns about the creation of parallel structures and an instrumentalist approach which views higher education as merely about the economy.\nSWITZERLAND\nImplications for universities of the mass immigration referendum\nLea Meister, Dominik Fitze and Melanie GlayreIn February Swiss voters approved plans to restrict immigration. This put on hold European programmes like Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020, restricting Swiss students' ability to study abroad and other European students' ability to study in Switzerland.\nEUROPE\nInvolving students in quality assurance\nFernando Miguel Galán PalomaresQuality assurance often focuses on issues such as employability, but students have a much more multi-layered appreciation of quality. Many do not know about the quality assurance initiatives undertaken by universities. They should be better engaged in the process, according to a recent project.\nSOUTH AFRICA\nLong walk before freedom – Lessons from young Mandela\nKitso RantaoAs a young South African, I have asked myself a somewhat odd question: Who was Nelson Mandela? I have been taught that he was the first black president of democratic South Africa, a martyr who was imprisoned for 27 years, a Nobel peace prize winner.\nGLOBAL\nAccess to higher education must be a global priority\nAengus Ó MaoláinTwo student debates on access to higher education demonstrate the gulf between the corporate attitude to access and systems that promote greater social responsibility. The student movement is determined to fight for access through universal funding.\nEUROPE\nThe student fightback against austerity has just begun\nRok PrimozicThe European Students’ Union is spearheading a fight for higher education as a public good and against those who would reduce it to serving the labour market as well as policy-makers who cut funding when Europe needs education to rebuild.\nMALAYSIA\nCoercion will not aid student learning\nAerie RahmanMalaysia’s decision to extend an Islamic and Asian Civilisation Studies course that is compulsory in public universities to private universities is an attack on university and student autonomy and freedom.\nSOUTH AFRICA\nLong walk before freedom – Lessons from young Mandela\nKitso RantaoAs a young South African, I have asked myself a somewhat odd question: Who is Nelson Mandela? I have been taught that he was the first black president of democratic South Africa, a martyr who was imprisoned for 27 years, a Nobel peace prize winner.\nEUROPE\nGraduate employability and the social good\nMichael Tolentino Frederiksen and Nevena VuksanovićDebates about employability are sometimes manipulated to suggest that all higher education should be tied to economic needs. Education is a much wider social good and one in which all members of society have a stake.\nARMENIA\nTuition fee hike out of touch with economic reality\nRok PrimozicPlans to raise tuition fees in Armenia up to 30% could have devastating consequences for Armenian society, as it would severely limit students’ chances of gaining access to higher education.\nTURKIYE\nConfronting the cause of the protests in Turkey\nOzan DemirerThe protests in Turkey are due to frustration with an authoritarian-style government, low levels of opposition and a desire among young people – in particular students – for a more open, more modern and younger politics.\nEUROPE\nDegree mobility + loans doesn’t work\nKarina UfertStudents have voted against the European Masters Degree Loan Guarantee Scheme, on the basis that loans are not the way forward and that they could result in students being hunted down for money owed.\nCANADA\nAliens in Canada – Diary of an international student\nFaizan KhanAdapting to studying in a different country presents many challenges, including overcoming language and cultural differences and being accepted by the local community. International students need to be viewed in ways that are mutually beneficial to them and the community.\nEUROPE\nGraduate unemployment – Whose fault is it?\nTaina MoisanderHigher education has been blamed for graduating too many students without the skills necessary for the job market. But debate is needed about the causes of graduate unemployment, before starting on narrow university reforms.\nEUROPE\nAct now for social inclusion in higher education\nFlorian KaiserThe European Union’s Social Dimension is a key part of the Bologna process. But social integration is likely to suffer as a result of the financial crisis, so now is the time to push for more action on access to higher education.\nEUROPE\nEuropean student numbers rise, but funding falls\nRok PrimozicA study of financing of students in Europe shows that, although student numbers are rising, funding is being cut and students are being asked to foot the bill. The effect on higher education access and quality is yet to be evaluated.\nSOUTH AFRICA\nA better future through education for the ‘born free’ generation\nKitso RantaoI am the offspring of South Africa’s current generation of domestics and garden workers, mine labourers, security guards and waitresses. We are referred to as the ‘born frees’ – children who have grown up post-apartheid.\nCHILE\nStudents demand education not segregation\nCamila VallejoPrivatisation and attacks on the humanities impoverish education and society. Chilean students and their colleagues across the Americas are fighting for a diverse and equitable public education system.\nUNITED STATES\nThoughts of an international student from Kenya\nMorrine OmoloIn retrospect, anything the human mind can conceive, it can achieve. It is no wonder that humans, endowed with this grandiose ability not evident in other creatures, have the ability to conquer even the harshest environments and make a home for themselves. Yet I remain sceptical about our future in the universe.\nSOUTH AFRICA\nInternational postgraduate students from Africa are struggling\nAdeagbo OluwafemiHigh numbers of postgraduate and international students in a university are major requirements for successful evaluation and ranking. African universities are now preaching ‘internationalisation’ and collaboration with foreign institutions through various programmes, for both research purposes and international recognition.\nSOMALIA\nStudents link up across the diaspora to fight famine\nAbdimalik BuulSomali students in the US are joining together to help first-generation Somalis get into higher education, and are linking up with fellow students in Mogadishu in a research project to promote positive change.\nUNITED KINGDOM\nStudent applications drop just the tip of the iceberg\nHannah BlackstockThe number of home student applicants to UK universities has fallen significantly this year. Some university figures are playing down the impact, but it could be just the tip of the iceberg after a decade of changes to university funding.\nUNITED KINGDOM\nUK: We feel duped by TASMAC, say Indian students\nJagdeep Singh Sadal and Suneet Patel*I had been working in Dubai for the last few years [says Jagdeep Singh Sadal] and my company said a masters degree would give me better opportunities. From TASMAC (Training and Advanced Studies in Management and Communications) in Pune, India, I was diverted from going to Canterbury Christchurch University in the UK, which I also looked at.\nEUROPE\nEUROPE: Time for higher education investment is now\nBert Vandenkendelaere*After a year of leading the European Students' Union, the umbrella organisation for 45 national student unions from 38 countries, and being intensively involved in higher education politics at different levels for the past six years, I am convinced that the momentum for investment in higher education is now. Ironically, only a few governments in Europe realise this.\nEUROPE\nEUROPE: More and better quality internships needed\nEuropean Youth Forum*Internships as part of education courses are increasingly seen as the key to better integration of young people into the labour market. The transition from full-time education to jobs is taking longer and becoming more difficult for young people.\nEGYPT\nEGYPT: The Tahrir Square spirit lingers on campus\nDavina Levy*I have been living in Cairo, arriving a few months prior to the revolution that began in September last year, and saw then how oppression permeated every aspect of life. Most people are familiar with the features of an unjust and dictatorial regime: police brutality, vote-rigging, media censorship and rampant corruption. However, the reality is much more sinister.\nUNITED KINGDOM\nUK: Sussex foreign students slate visa restrictions\nAlya MishraThe International Students' Office at the University of Sussex has been inundated with emails and inquiries from foreign students worried about the proposed clampdown on visas and employment rights for non-EU students.\nIRAN\nIRAN: Barred for my activism, with no legal recourse\nPuyan Mahmoudian*I was previously a member of the student union and the Islamic Student Association at Amirkabir University. I was also the executive officer and editor-in-chief of the student publication Rivar for which I wrote articles on culture and politics, critical of the government and in favour of democracy and human rights.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Reports suggest that the campus dress police target women more than men, yet dialogue on the topic is lacking. A selection of articles and personal reflections highlight some of the talking points.\nFocus on Nigeria\nNIGERIA\nA year of crisis in Nigerian HE as economy spirals downward\nNigeria’s higher education system has been creaking under the strain of a declining economy. Ongoing fuel hikes are preventing students and staff from getting to campuses. Academics are talking of quitting, students of dropping out and researchers of halting projects amid soaring inflation. A team from University World News reports on the crisis.\nStudent Support Services\nAFRICA\nStudent support services remain crucial for degree completion\nStudent support services are crucial building blocks towards students’ successful completion of their studies. Amid cultural, generational and educational shifts, universities have had to rethink the nature of student support services.

It has become one of the major challenges facing the higher education sector on the continent. The crisis is affecting the academic success of students who have shared their experiences with University World News. Apart from a few plans and public-private partnerships, governments and institutions appear to lack the appetite to act.\nEnhancing Student Employment\nAFRICA-SOUTH AFRICA\nTime to build a different culture of learning and teaching\nThe Technological Higher Education Network South Africa or THENSA is focusing much attention on competency-based learning and teaching, student entrepreneurship and changes in the workplace, including the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

Successful and mutually beneficial projects involving researchers and teachers on various continents show that much can be achieved through these collaborative efforts.\nAgricultural Higher Education\nAFRICA\nAgricultural higher education for sustainable development\nUniversities engaged in agricultural research and education are contributing to sustainable economic development through tackling food security challenges due to climate change and also by enabling the growth of agri-businesses and entrepreneurship. In these efforts, the Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture and its 143 member institutions are playing a leading role.\nFall 2021 AAP Dialogue Series\nAFRICA\nExpanding research on insects as food source is urgent\nGlobally, the human population grows by about 83 million people annually.

Insects may be a part of the solution.\nEntrepreneurship in Higher Education\nSOUTH AFRICA-AFRICA\nUniversities’ role in ‘entrepreneurial ecosystem’ considered\nWhat is an entrepreneurial university? What is the role of universities in nurturing a culture of entrepreneurship amid alarming youth unemployment rates in South Africa and the rest of Africa? What should the nature of entrepreneurial education be amid existing concerns over academic capitalism?

Additionally, 256 students from Yemen will be impacted.\nThe partial restriction will also impact approximately 5,000 students, with Venezuela’s students (3,904) on the top, followed by 824 African students from Sierra Leone (385), Togo (240) and Burundi (199), along with 180 students from Turkmenistan, Cuba's students (117), and Laos’ students (114).\nBesides completely restricting entry to the US by nationals from 12 countries, the proclamation also includes partial restrictions to seven other countries.\nThe complete travel ban will affect seven African countries, namely, Chad, Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Libya, Somalia, and Sudan, along with two Middle Eastern countries, namely Yemen and Iran, as well as Haiti, Myanmar and Afghanistan.\nThe partial restriction affects three African countries, namely, Burundi, Togo and Sierra Leone, plus Cuba and Venezuela from Latin America, and Laos in Southeast Asia and Turkmenistan in Central Asia.\nVisas issued before 9 June will not be revoked, the order said.\nTrump described the ban as a matter of national security. The Executive Order states that the countries targeted are those “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a full or partial suspension”.\nOther reasons cited include the alleged breaking of US visa rules by people from the countries in question.\nThis proclamation order echoes Trump’s controversial 2017 travel ban on seven Muslim-majority countries.\nIran denounced the proclamation, describing it as “discriminatory” and a “violation” of international law, according to a report by Kurdistan 24.\nAlireza Hashemi Raja, director general for the Department of Iranian Affairs Abroad at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issued a statement asserting that the decision undermines core principles of international law, including non-discrimination and basic human rights.\nThe African Union Commission issued a statement on 5 June saying it “remains concerned about the potential negative impact of such measures on people-to-people ties, educational exchange”.\n“While recognising the sovereign right of all nations to protect their borders and ensure the security of their citizens, the African Union Commission respectfully appeals to the United States to exercise this right in a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa,” the statement said.\nSpeaking to University World News, Ahmed Alduais, Yamani postdoctoral fellow at the faculty of Social and Educational Sciences of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, criticised the new ban as a form of “coercive exclusion of entire populations based on the actions or instability of their governments”.\n“The ban directly undermines human resource development by severing access to higher education, research collaboration, and academic mobility.”\nHe said it disproportionately affects individuals from politically unstable or economically disadvantaged nations.\nPattern of academic marginalisation\nBut for Yemeni academics, the new US travel ban merely formalises a long-standing pattern of academic marginalisation, he said.\nDr Abdullatif AlMunifi from the faculty of engineering of Sana’a University in Yemen told University World News. Unfortunately, fellowships, scholarships, and other exchange programmes were suspended years ago because of the fragile situation in Yemen. Therefore, no additional impact to what already happened.\nJames Otieno Jowi, the founding executive director of the Kenya-based African Network for Internationalisation of Education ANIE, told University World News: “This development will impact negatively on HE collaborations between the USA and the affected countries, as it will bring academic mobility to a halt.”\nHe said a number of countries affected by the ban are in the middle of or just emerging from conflict, with weakened higher education systems.\n“While these affected countries could have been looking for global cooperation to enable them, rebuild and strengthen their systems, the travel ban dampens some of their efforts,” Jowi indicated.\nHe suggested that students from the affected countries would seek opportunities with other key players in internationalisation, especially Europe, China and India, but perhaps even South America.\nHe added that despite the physical ban on travel to the US, there remained opportunities for digital collaboration between universities and academics.\nStrengthening alternative academic partnerships\nWalid Gashout, president of the Higher Education Students Foundation in Libya, told University World News: “As Libya is already in a critical phase of rebuilding its educational institutions, this restriction adds another layer of difficulty to its academic development and global engagement.\n“It underscores the urgent need to strengthen alternative academic partnerships, especially with non-Western countries and regional allies.\n“Africa must respond by strengthening local higher education, enhancing regional partnerships, and building bridges of collaboration with alternative global powers,” Gashout suggested.\nArshin Adib-Moghaddam, a professor in global thought and comparative philosophies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, said Africa should invest in an educational infrastructure that is self-sufficient and globally linked to non-legacy countries, especially in the Global South.\n“Such efforts could be institutionalised via the African Union or global intergovernmental institutions such as BRICS.”\nSouth-South travel options\nProfessor Mohamed Hassan, president of the Sudanese National Academy of Sciences (SNAS), told University World News that the complete or partial ban affecting 10 African countries “restricts talented African scientists from studying at leading US universities” and harms US host institutions that benefit from diverse perspectives in scientific research.\n“Many of these students typically secure jobs in the US, contributing further to advancements in science. Consequently, the ban is unlikely to have a significant effect on their home countries.”\nA former president of the World Academy of Sciences (TWAS) in Italy, he said as an alternative, African students can take advantage of world-class universities in the Global South, such as the postgraduate programmes offered by the World Academy of Sciences, which provide postgraduate fellowships to African students at top institutions in China, India, Brazil, and South Africa.\nBut if African countries are to reduce the exodus of talented African students and researchers, they must enhance their education and research quality, ensuring that more universities meet international standards and attract students to study at home, he said.\nUnite behind Agenda 2063’\nProfessor Vincent Titanji, honorary dean of the faculty of science at the University of Buea in Cameroon, told University World News that the ban was not surprising, given the unflattering opinion of the African continent held by the current US president.\nTitanji, who is a fellow at the Kenya-based African Academy of Sciences and the Italy-based World Academy of Sciences, said African countries should unite around the Agenda 2063 of the African Union and invest more in science and technology for the sustainable development of the continent.\nThis would include funding the African Union Scientific, Research and Innovation Council ASRIC, of which he is a former vice-president: “to play its role fully”.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Among them are top national institutions such as the University of Tokyo, Kyoto University, and Tohoku University, which lead Japan’s world-class scientific and technology research.\nAt a meeting of the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation chaired by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on 4 June, Ishiba instructed relevant ministries to recruit researchers seeking to leave the US.\n“We will enhance our efforts to attract excellent researchers from overseas, including the United States, amid the US government’s policies that have raised concerns about research activities,” he said at the meeting held at the prime minister’s office.\nA statement released on 30 May by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology Toshiko Abe, said Japan will adopt an “All-Japan” approach to support opportunities for highly talented and motivated young people.\nAbe told Japan’s parliament, the Diet, that the government will assist Japanese students and researchers enrolled at Harvard University and other universities in the US. A hotline for Japanese students has been created by the ministry.\nAbe said her ministry had received positive responses to support offers from students and researchers from about 90 universities in the United States.\nTohoku University offer\nLast month, Tohoku University held recruitment events for young researchers in the United States, including those at Stanford University and hospitals affiliated with Harvard Medical School, according to Tohoku University.\nConsultations with prospective applicants focused on research themes and employment status, as well as salaries, which are viewed as significantly lower in Japan than those in the US.\nTohoku University has been selected as one of Japan’s International Research Excellence Universities under a government initiative to raise domestic research standards. This provides Tohoku with additional funds for research. The university said it will invest JPY30 billion (US$209 million) over the next five years to hire 500 researchers who want to leave the US. The plan does not stipulate a salary cap.\nUndergraduate and graduate students enrolled in US universities who face problems continuing their studies due to Trump’s policies will be accepted at Tohoku as non-degree students who are not required to pay tuition or enrolment fees.\n“We will gather outstanding researchers from around the world, including the United States,” Tohoku University President Teiji Tominaga told Japanese media on 5 June.\nThe university reported it has already received commitments from 61 researchers, including 16 based in the US.\nUnder the International Research Excellence Universities programme, Tohoku University is strengthening partnerships with universities in the US. For example, a joint quantum technology lab will be established at the University of Chicago as part of a new Chicago-Tohoku Quantum Alliance to build an international quantum workforce and a joint semiconductor research centre at the University of Washington.\nIn September 2024, Tohoku and the University of Washington set up a joint research fund for collaborative research, which funded four joint projects from this April.\nOther universities to accept students\nRitsumeikan University, another leading institution, is planning to accept up to 50 students, and the affiliated Asia Pacific University is also preparing to accept up to 50 students. In addition, Ritsumeikan University alone is considering accepting up to 16 researchers with no specific restrictions on nationality.\n“By welcoming such highly motivated and globally minded students to our campus, we expect that they will provide meaningful inspiration to our students,” Takumi Suenaga, manager of the university’s international admissions office, told University World News.\nWith almost half of its 6,500-strong student body comprising foreign students, the university has traditionally recognised the importance of diversity on its campus.\nStill, Japan faces competition for US-based researchers and students from universities in Europe and other parts of Asia, with a global flurry of offers.\nProfessor Hiroshi Ota, an international education expert at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo, said: “Japanese universities are proposing an emergency solution as [they] did when Japan accepted a limited number of students from Ukraine when they had to escape the war with Russia”.\nHowever, he noted that programmes offered by universities targeting international students are mostly short-term and non-degree.\n“The focus of Japanese universities’ offers now seems to be to assist Japanese nationals studying in the US,” Ota told University World News.\nThe University of Osaka announced on 28 May it is considering specific support measures, including waiving tuition fees for Harvard students and researchers.\nThe university’s Graduate School of Medicine said it has secured financial resources of JPY600 million (US$4.12 million) to JPY1 billion to establish a system to accept up to about 100 researchers, regardless of nationality.\n“In the United States, where outstanding researchers gather from all over the world, something terrible is happening,” Masaru Ishii, who heads the Graduate School of Medicine, said in a statement. “The inability to continue excellent research is a loss for humanity as a whole,” he said.\nThe statement continued: “Support is important for future academic and international development. We will provide an environment where they can engage in cutting-edge research with peace of mind.”\nA popular destination\nKyoto University announced on 27 May it would accept international students from Harvard if they are forced by the US administration to give up their studies there. Offers of support for undergraduate and graduate students state that enrolment will be based on a programme agreed with the university in the US where the students are currently enrolled.\nStudents will be hosted as non-regular students, according to the Japan Student Services Organization (JASSO) website, which also notes the possibility of students being accepted as regular students in the Graduate School of Engineering.\nThe US is the most popular destination for Japanese students studying abroad, with almost 14,000 Japanese students in the US in 2023 to 2024 – the fourth-largest group of international students.\nWhile precise numbers of Japanese researchers in the US are unavailable, given the different ways in which researchers are defined, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science supports some 220 Japanese PhDs at the US National Institutes of Health, which is earmarked for swingeing cuts by the Trump administration.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

University World News is solely responsible for the editorial content.\nHe pointed to a Gallup poll  of the public showing a drop from 57% having ‘a great deal’ or ‘quite a lot’ of trust in higher education in 2015 to 36% in 2023.\nThe decline is much stronger among Republicans. In 2015, 56% of them had a great deal or quite a lot of trust in higher education, and in 2023 this had fallen to 19%, whereas among Democrats the fall was much smaller, from 68% to 59%.\nBut Rogers noted that according to Gallup, higher education is not alone in seeing a decline in trust. It is happening right across societal institutions. For example, over the period 2021 to 2023, there was a decline in trust in small business, the military, the police, the medical system, the church, the supreme court – and the presidency.\n“Notice the decline in every civic organisation. That is a real challenge for a civic society,” he said.\nIn his speech Rogers urged universities to counter this trend by ramping up their commitment to lifelong learning and to social mobility and to ensuring every student fulfils their potential.\nUnder his leadership, Bowling Green, located 85 miles south of Detroit, reports record enrolments, its highest applications and admission rates, and historic four-year graduation and retention rates.\nAccording to its website, it is seeking to embrace its role as a ‘public university for the public good’ by ensuring the institution continually adapts to meet workforce and societal needs, advances social mobility and improves ways to maximise the success of every individual student.\nTo achieve these goals, Rogers has led the expansion of the university’s portfolio to focus on health care and STEM fields, establishing new schools of nursing, physical therapy, aviation, the built environment and engineering, resort and attraction management, forensic science and advanced manufacturing.\nAnd he is behind the launch of Life Design, a university-wide initiative to support and empower Bowling Green’s 20,000 students to excel in college and career.\nUniversity World News talked to him about these goals and how universities can achieve them and win back trust in the current context of universities’ purpose and modes of operation being challenged.\nThe interview has been edited for length and to suit the written format.\nUWN: So turning to the important questions you raised at the ABET symposium, why have people lost trust in higher education?\nRR: There are many issues. In my role, I have a chance to talk with a lot of different folks, legislators and the executive branch (both at our state level and at the national level) and also parents and students.\nPart of it is a clash of expectations. But we have fed into it a bit by aligning ourselves with an emphasis on higher education being ‘all about getting a job’, and I think that’s tricky because then when students fail to get a job, the university is deemed to have ‘failed’, which undermines trust in higher ed.\nBut there are other issues too: a general decline in trust in all civic organisations, not just higher ed (at least here in the States), flowing from a growing tendency of people not believing that there are good people in the world trying to do good work.\nIn the States, people often seem to have a perspective that ‘someone’s out to take advantage of me and take advantage of my family’ – and so, somehow, we have lost the attitude of balancing individual rights and freedoms with the common good. We’ve forgotten about how we need one another, and I think some of that is why we're seeing the distrust in higher ed – as well as in the military, in the police, and so on.\nUWN: Do we know who has lost trust in higher education? Is it people who've been to college and failed? Is it people who've never been to college? Is it broader than that?\nRR: Well, if you look at the Gallup poll, the people who went to college have more trust than the people who didn’t. But even among those who did go to college, trust in higher ed declined – to a lesser extent, but it declined, nonetheless.\nOften, when I talk to individuals about their problems with higher ed, I’ll ask them to tell me about their college experience. And usually that's positive, because they’re in a place of success – for example, often they're a legislator, or they're a successful business leader or educational leader. And then they’ll be positive about their own college experience but still worried about overall higher ed.\nIn that regard, DEI – diversity, equity and inclusion – is a very hot issue right now in the United States, and I think we are mostly talking past each other on what DEI even is.\nUWN: Do some people see DEI as discrimination against white people?\nRR: They do. It’s a ‘reverse discrimination’ argument. And then others counter with the argument that they’re working to make sure everybody is a part of the process and has opportunities to be successful. Some also make a big distinction about equality of opportunity versus equality of outcomes. I believe that everyone should have equal opportunity; that doesn’t, however, guarantee equal outcomes for everybody.\nUWN: Isn’t the mission of universities to help people get in and get on? Shouldn’t they be striving to offer better access and wider access, but also better success and wider success once you're in?\nRR: I agree. Let’s not lose sight of individual learners. What do we need to do to address their needs so they can be successful? It’s about making sure that we improve and widen access, making sure that we are being responsive to the different learning styles of our students, and knowing that their background, life experience and preparation may be different than someone else’s. All of that is true.\nHere’s perhaps the crux of this argument, though; we can't guarantee the success of an individual student.\nSeeking equality of outcomes could be interpreted to suggest that it doesn't matter what the student does or doesn't do. And I think that’s where the Republicans may begin to think, ‘Oh, it’s just about outcomes, and you're going to give away the degrees anyway. The student doesn't have to work. All they have to do is show up.’\nI can categorically say, at least for Bowling Green, that's not what we’re doing.\nUWN: Why do some people think that that’s what universities are doing? Is it a case that some universities are doing things well and others aren't?\nRR: I think there is a widely shared belief that higher education is monolithic. I don’t believe we are. We have common goals, and we need to stay focused on some common goals that make us part of higher ed. But there’s a lot of variation in higher ed.\nA cynic might say that what the politicians are doing is they’re looking for those one-off examples to make their point; it’s a data point of one, and they make conclusions about an entire industry. Now I would hope that if they got a degree in higher ed, they would be better critical thinkers than that – but often they're not.\nOne other thing I’ll say: in the US, there’s always a political dynamic in any type of organisation, whether it be the military, the government, higher ed, K through 12, NGO, whatever. And I think, in the US, the level of political discourse within every organisation is a real problem.\nUWN:  Isn’t part of the problem that politics has become so divisive, toxic even. And how might higher education contribute to reducing that?\nRR: Well, I can talk about one initiative in this regard. In the state of Ohio two years ago, we saw the creation of five civic centres within five of the 14 public universities (excluding Bowling Green).\nI think the initiative was a response to this belief that there is political indoctrination going on at universities, and the intention was to counter this. And I was told that, for the most part, the targets were the universities that were the bigger problems in this regard.\nThe initiative was to set up civic centres to teach the ‘American form of democracy’ and ‘the American form of capitalism’. And the justifying argument made was they needed to ‘balance’ what the university was teaching. There are a lot of strings attached to this intervention; the legislature gets to decide – they're like the board of directors for these centres.\nAnd this is back to the comment that we're not a monolithic industry.\nSo, by contrast, what we did at Bowling Green – and I think I would encourage all universities in the US, at least, to begin to think about what we created – is to set up a Democracy Research Network. It’s driven out of our political science department, but it has faculty fellows across the university. We put programming on. We sponsor debates on both sides of these arguments. We try to do programming to help students, to teach students intentionally how to have civil discourse.\nWe just sponsored a Leadership Forum where we had a former Democrat governor, Dick Celeste, and a former Republican governor of the state of Ohio, Bob Taft, come to campus, and we had 550 students in our ballroom listening to these former governors – they were in office in the 1980s and 1990s, so not recent.\nMost of these students would not have heard of these two public figures, but they spoke about what they disagreed about, what they did agree about, and how they had to compromise and find a way forward.\nSo, to answer your question about what higher education might do to mitigate toxic politics: I think we've got to bring people together and be role models ourselves, of how you have civil discourse.\nI think universities almost have to begin a kind of renewal of civil discourse. I think about our faculty senates; how do we replicate civic discourse? How do we make sure our students see that we model civil discourse – that we regularly disagree on certain topics, can admit we’re wrong, can thank the other side for pointing that out, and can adjust our practice? If universities don’t do it, I don't know where it will happen.\nI think politicians often think that students come to college to have these big political discussions. But I will tell you, the students that come to a university like Bowling Green are still 35% first-generation college students.\nWe have students who don’t necessarily come from really wealthy families. We have students who are middle class, some upper middle class, some lower middle class, and some that are full Pell eligible – meaning they can get Pell grants for students from economically disadvantaged families, mostly those with gross family income under US$60,000 – but they're pretty pragmatic people; they’ve come to get a great education and to begin a career in life.\nSo, the reality is the students aren’t thinking about politics. They’re coming to study nursing, they’re coming to study engineering, and they’re coming to study accounting.\nAnd my bigger worry is that students are getting very turned off of politics, that people don’t want to even engage in the process – and that isn’t good for a democracy either.\nUWN: And especially if they are international students, in the current context they risk being deported if they get involved in politics. Is that something you've been impacted by?\nRR: Well, probably only about 7% of Bowling Green’s student body are international students. But, yes, I'm still extremely concerned. There's a real pushback on globalisation right now and on immigration.\nOhio is one of those states in the US that was a very heavy manufacturing state with a lot of jobs – good jobs that did not necessarily need high levels of education. And so, there are a lot of individuals who are unhappy right now because those kinds of well-paying manufacturing jobs are gone, and people blame other countries for taking them – even though in some cases people probably didn’t want to do those jobs that these other countries are now doing.\nSo, it’s a conundrum.\nBut this current, more nationalistic approach, this push against globalisation, worries me, as an American, because in higher ed we were all about trying to bring in as many people as possible to talk about ideas, to debate, to share best practices, and to embrace alternative perspectives.\nUWN: And getting back to the original question about building trust, am I right that you have record levels of enrolment at Bowling Green? And can this partly be attributed to extending out to communities where people weren’t previously enrolling at such high rates?\nRR: We’re picking up more out-of-state students, and we’re also picking up the yield rate, meaning the percentage of students admitted to actually attend has ticked up, as well as the total number of applications.\nPart of the reason for our increasing enrolment levels is we’re taking some market share from some other universities, and a big reason for this is an initiative we have at Bowling Green called ‘Life Design’, which resonates not only with the students but also especially with their families.\nI believe students like to be held to clear standards and high standards; that is our premise. And there’s student retention literature that would suggest that having appropriately high and clear expectations leads to higher levels of student success. You don’t make it easier; you make it clear and appropriately high.\nAnd I think that resonates with students. It resonates that, with Life Design, we are empowering them to design their college experience. We tell them, effectively, ‘We’ll give you a design coach. You’ve got to come up with your own Falcon Flight Path. We’re going to help you design that – but it’s up to you to do it.’\nOurs is a pretty traditional undergrad population, with 95% full-time students – residential – and so we've leaned into that, to say that's our advantage: to be very intentional about the student experience.\nIn other words, a student’s ‘flight path’ is everything from thinking about what they want out of their life, why they are in college, and what major to choose to whether they are going to be involved and engaged.\nUnderstanding how to build their professional and social network is also a big part of it, as is building their team for life: making connections at college and choosing whom they want on their team, if you will, through their career.\nAnd it starts with our students reflecting back on how they learn. We try to raise their awareness that what we're really trying to do is teach them how to learn to learn, and if they’re really good at it, how to be better at learning to learn, which is what I would call ‘meta learning’: learning to learn to learn.\nSo this is part of making our university a learning organisation. Some people might think, ‘Well, aren't all universities learning organisations?’ But they’re not.\nAnother positive that’s come out of using design thinking, which is an action-orientated framework, and having students keep that framework in mind, is the emphasis on prototyping and we ask them to apply that framework as they go to college and begin to think about using it in their career and in their life.\nEqually, we have done workshops for faculty around design thinking. And so now everybody's using some common language. And what I love is when a faculty member comes to me and says, ‘Hey, I want to prototype this idea. We’re going to test this out.’\nSometimes, universities’ faculty don't want to take those kinds of risks to try things – they fear their course evaluations could be bad. ‘Well, yeah, they could,’ is our response, ‘But you’re trying it, so do it. We understand.’\nAnd so I think that central to a learning organisation is this idea of a growth mindset.\nUWN: So do universities in general have a growth mindset? Are they flexible enough to adapt to lifelong learning and a world of change?\nRR: Right now, there are a lot of universities – in the States, at least – that have a mindset of ‘cut, cut, cut, we've got to reduce faculty, we’ve got to reduce options’. And of course part of the reality is that if your enrolment continues to decline, there are fewer resources. I get it. But it’s got to be more about: how do we get better? How do we differentiate ourselves? How do we get back on a growth trajectory?\nWith regard to lifelong learning, everybody talks about an enrolment cliff. I think it's an enrolment shift. What we've got to think about is the learner’s journey, and for the most part, especially at a place like Bowling Green, we’re only focused on those aged 18 to 22, and then we have, you know, PhD students, although even our PhD students tend to be pretty young.\nBut, increasingly, I think, with regard to lifelong learning, are we helping our students, once they’re adults, to find that path to come back to university if they need to? And I don’t think we are. We’re basically saying, ‘It would have been better if you had just stayed with us all the way through.’ But, if we're serious about an enrolment shift – about helping educate people that are rethinking and changing their career – it can’t be training. It's got to be education, first of all.\nAnd, even then, are we confident that we understand, from a user perspective, the barriers that we need to remove to help those students come back? And I suspect we haven’t paid that much attention. We're trying to be better at that, but we’re not yet where we need to be.\nI think some of the for-profits are much more flexible on that, because they’ve had to be, right, to try to make the thing work? But I think for many of the traditional universities, it's just not how we're built. So we're in a kind of legacy model, and we’re trying to adjust to a changing world.\nUWN: And isn’t the problem that that model was created in the 19th century for the growth of industrialisation, a completely different world? Whereas now, that's all changed with the digital revolution, with the advent of AI?\nRR: Yes, and what's common between the two? It’s a massive change in how work is done. I would argue that, with AI and the technology we have today, it’s an even bigger change than the Industrial Revolution, and so it's more important than ever that universities be at the table, preparing students for that kind of career.\nBut we still need people for other things as well.\nUWN: How do you, as a university leader, prepare students for this changing world? What changes do you bring in to enable it?\nRR: We’ve undertaken a number of initiatives at the university. We had a donor that was willing to create an innovation fund, and we have funded, thus far, about 20 projects based on faculty suggestions for implementing AI. In some cases it’s about making grading more efficient or an evaluation of reading papers, and, in some, staff are experimenting with bots for advising and mentoring.\nUWN: Is that done in connection with industry – with the people on the cutting edge of work?\nRR: It is. We have some alums that work in the innovation space who have been very helpful in coming back and engaging faculty in this. And then, in specific academic programmes, like our engineering programmes and our business programme, and in our business college and a couple of other places, there is much more engagement with specific companies.\nUWN: We’ve talked about preparing graduates for the future. But are universities involved enough in lifelong learning? You mentioned that in that regard the university is not where it needs to be. Are universities rushing to catch up? Or are they leading the way in shaping how lifelong learning is?\nRR: So I think we are laggers in that regard: that universities, in general, are behind the learning curve. I don't know about globally, but here in the States, I think this is the case. You know, there again, we're not monolithic; the legacy universities, those that have been around 100-plus years, I don't think they've been as aggressive in this space as they could be – or as thoughtful as they could be about this idea of serving the needs of lifelong learners.\nBut necessity really is the mother of invention. And so now, because of the demographic decline and the enrolment cliff in the traditional market, we all have to be engaging with our options.\nCertainly, we could simply shrink and accept that that's who we are. But we have a chance now to remake ourselves, and that’s exciting.\nWe can learn from some of the failures that those at the head of the curve have experienced. For instance, I think some of the for-profit, sometimes online, universities have had some challenges. I think part of the challenge is probably that they were much more about training than they were about education. So how do we at Bowling Green take our approach to truly educating learners but apply that to this ‘post-traditional’ market? That’s our opportunity.\nUWN: Is there even agreement on what lifelong learning means? Because publicly it tends to be talked about in terms of retraining, re-skilling and upskilling for new jobs, which is a very particular view, and politicians love to talk about higher education just being about jobs, whereas education is much broader than that. How are universities applying their thinking to deciding what lifelong learning should be about?\nRR: I’m reflecting back on our work with an organisation that works in a healthcare-related field. It's a space where you don't necessarily need a bachelor's degree, yet they were working with us to develop a pathway for their employees to achieve a bachelor degree because they felt it was important. And so I asked them why.\nTheir reasoning was very interesting. They said individuals with a bachelor degree tend to have more empathy because they have a broader education, and empathy is really important for their patients. So when that patient is there, they will receive better quality care.\nPeople with a bachelor's degree, they reasoned, have probably interacted with a lot of different people from different backgrounds; it’s linked into that. The organisation cited a list of five or six things that their data would suggest lead to better patient care.\nSo, to answer your question, I think we’ve got to do a better job of partnering with employers, especially those with the kind of data that would demonstrate why employees having a bachelor or a masters degree is leading to better outcomes for their organisation.\nWe’ve got to have companies and other organisations telling the story, arguing for why education is leading to better outcomes for them.\nThat’s one path, and then the other path is what I tell our students, which is why you should have a college degree. You don't need to. You can have a great career, and you can get a good job and make money without a college degree, no doubt. But the college degree gives students more options and opportunities; it empowers them to control their destiny.\nSo I think the other part of this issue of lifelong learning is making sure students also take ownership of their degree. They’re going to work hard to earn that degree, but I want them to also realise that it's not guaranteed – and that the chances are that, by having it, they are going to be better prepared to pivot, to adjust, and to have a lifetime of careers rather than just that first job.\nUWN: So, do you foresee a future in which universities reduce this emphasis on everyone coming in and doing three years in one go, where there may be many more opportunities for people to achieve the type of education that they do for degrees but in segments over time?\nIt seems the discussion tends to assume either you do a university degree or you are going to need some upskilling in the form of lifelong learning – whereas doing what universities do, but ‘in a lifelong learning way’, would be much more flexible.\nRR: Yes, another thing we’re testing is this idea of integrated work to learning. And we’re doing this with two or three companies right now, one of them called Six Flags.\nThere are some other companies where students – as full-time employees of the organisation – can pivot in and out of certain seven-week courses. They’re not full semester courses, but they offer more flexibility and then projects, with the students possibly busy on some work-related projects.\nBut the question arises: how do we use some of that experience or that work to count towards some academic credit? We've got to make sure the accrediting bodies are comfortable with that idea. But I think this kind of integration of work and academics will be crucial as we proceed.\nUWN: Could it be an option for the future that companies build into employees’ careers, ‘study sabbaticals’ where they go off and do, for instance, these seven-week units every year or a three-month unit every four years or something like that, in the process building up their educational portfolio?\nRR: Yes. And even the other way around; think about faculty going and doing a stint in a company or organisation, not necessarily just on their research but perhaps more in the applied fields.\nFor how do faculty gain a better sense of what employers need and want? How do we have almost co-faculty or joint faculty appointments – such as, for instance, between an engineer working for Boeing and a professor at X university? I guess it's an extension of the idea of a teaching hospital and how that's a big part of medical education.\nSo, do we need more of those kinds of options applied to more of our disciplines? We have it to some extent. We’re a big education school, and those students spend their senior year full-time student teaching, but during their sophomore junior year, they also spend time in the classroom. And, you know, we have high school teachers that come back and forth between the employer and the university.\nBut we don’t do that much in business, in our business college. And we don’t do that a lot in engineering, although it happens a bit with clinical faculty.\nUWN: You spoke in the opening keynote at the ABET symposium about the need to constantly raise standards. The role of quality assurance and accreditation bodies is also being challenged at the moment. Tell us why they matter.\nRR: I think quality assurance and accrediting bodies are very important; they give accountability and ensure quality.\nWith ABET – and I also did a lot of work with the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, or AACSB, on the business side – there is this idea of having peers that are experts reviewing programmes as a feedback loop.\nThis is incredibly important, because I think often governmental agencies may not have the people with the required expertise that organisations like ABET and other quality assurance agencies have.\nMy worry about some accrediting bodies is that sometimes they hamper innovation and creativity; they hamper the ability to try a new approach because it doesn't fit in the standards.\nAnd so we always need this balance between ensuring quality but having flexibility, where institutions that wish to push the envelope on some things have that opportunity – as long as they’re willing to be held accountable and to provide feedback on what’s working or not working, of course.\nUWN: ABET tell me they actually structure their criteria to promote creativity and have innovation awards.\nYes, and in general, what I appreciate about ABET is they are trying to think about what we’re doing to navigate this world in which we have a bunch of post-traditional students out there needing to be educated.\nIn Ohio, there are, I don’t know, maybe a million people who have some college but no degree. Wow! What a market. That’s huge, right?\nBut then we also have an obligation to think about those people that do have a degree but are not in a position to be successful in their current situation and are looking to adjust their career in some way.\nUWN: Can I ask you about DEI and the research cuts the Trump administration is imposing? Because there are so many research cuts that are affecting universities and so many research projects that are having their funding cut off, and it's affecting international teams they collaborate with as well. Has that affected you?\nIt's been challenging. We don't have a medical school, so although we have some National Institutes of Health, or NIH, funding, it's not as significant as at some of our sister institutions.\nNSF, or National Science Foundation, funding worries us a lot, and especially with regard to the F&A (indirect cost) rate change. But some funding has been pulled based on the language that was used. I think a lot of the projects targeted have been identified by AI, and quite honestly I think this shows the weakness of AI, because it focused on a particular word that was used rather than seeing the whole context, leading to arbitrary decisions to pull the funding.\nUWN: This language problem applies both to research and to the DEI work in universities. You know, is there a way to continue working towards those values but using a different language? And, if so, what is the language? Have you thought that through?\nRR: ‘Student success’: that’s the language I use. Because even those individuals that I've engaged with that are the most extreme in their displeasure with DEI, if you press them and ask, ‘Are you supportive of students, regardless of their background – whether it be their sex, colour, national origin, race, gender, gender identity – are you opposed to us having programming to help those students to be successful?\nIf they chose to come to Bowling Green, regardless of their background, I can help them be successful. Are you supportive of that?’ And they respond, ‘Absolutely, of course. We’re supportive of that.’ Well, okay, because that's what we’re doing; we’re going to help them be successful.\nAnd I would say the other thing that we have really leaned into is that any programming we do is truly open to all. It’s always been open to all, but sometimes we didn’t talk about it that way. We talked about it as being an initiative for this race and this gender.\nI think we have to be clear we’re not excluding anyone. But you also can’t erase history, either, and people have to be aware. And sometimes I feel like we believe you need to be proud of your history. Well, there’s some history we’re not proud of, but it is our history, and I think what we should be proud of is what we’ve learnt about ourselves and the kind of communities and civilisation we want to be a part of.\nSo I agree with your point that the language and how we talk about student success is important. But I also believe in the old saying that those who forget their history are doomed to repeat it. We have to know our history, because it’s who we are; it’s who the culture is today.\nIn this regard, one last comment I’ll make, which I’ve been saying a lot to our faculty: let’s focus on what we aspire to create right now in the US. I’m not sure there are aspirations. I’m being critical not just of the current administration but of multiple administrations here. I can’t change any of that, but what I can hope to influence at my own university is this: let’s aspire to something. And that's why our mantra is ‘A public university for the public good’.\nSo we are aspiring to create the public good. We do it through our students, through our research, and through our outreach, and I hope every faculty member can talk about the good that they are creating.\nAnd that doesn’t mean that we don't care about the individual rights and freedoms of the students. We absolutely do. We want to empower them to pursue great careers and great lives, but when they do that, public good is created.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

At the time, Premier Doug Ford, himself a college dropout, criticised student unions and some clubs for promoting “crazy Marxist nonsense”.\nIn a statement recently released to the Globe and Mail, Bianca Giacoboni, a summer intern working for Nolan Quinn, Minister of Colleges, Universities, Research Excellence and Security, said: “Our government believes students applying to our post-secondary institutions deserve to know the criteria directly related to their academic achievements and potential for success at an institution.”\nGiacoboni attempted to head off criticisms that the bill’s requirement that admission “be based on the merit of the individual applicant” equates to a stepping back from equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) programmes designed to help students from under-represented groups enter post-secondary studies.\n“To be clear, there will always be pathways for those with disabilities and other under-represented groups, and the consultations [with colleges and universities, as the bill’s regulations are written] will help ensure we are increasing transparencies around these [admissions] policies to make it easier for students to apply,” she stated.\nStudent services\nLike other critics, Marc Spooner, a professor in the University of Regina’s Faculty of Education, noted that the bill “is a distraction from the real issues facing Ontario’s post-secondary system: the scandalous underfunding resulting from decades of substandard provincial grants and tuition, which the Ford government froze a number of years ago as a populist move. Ontario, the province with by far the largest economy, is last in post-secondary education spending”.\nFor its part, Ontario Student Voices (OSV), a province-wide advocacy group that represents 100,000 students at the province’s colleges and polytechnic institutions, said: “Bill 33 represents a concerning shift in the provincial government’s approach to post-secondary education. Rather than addressing the chronic underfunding facing colleges and polytechnics, the bill introduces top-down regulatory changes that could sideline students and institutions from key decisions.”\nAccording to OSV, the bill is a wolf in sheep’s clothing.\n“While framed as enhancing oversight, the bill would grant the government sweeping regulatory powers to dictate which ancillary fees institutions can charge. Ancillary fees directly fund vital student services such as mental health care, food banks, and peer support programmes.\nRegulating these fees at a time when demand for services is at an all-time high and institutional funding remains severely constrained is deeply troubling,” OSV said in a statement on its website.\nAfter noting that the government had lost the 2019 case, the statement continued: “We strongly reiterate that student associations must retain the ability to govern and fund their own organisations. Undermining this autonomy would compromise the very services students rely on to succeed.”\nOSV’s executive director, Lynn Courville said: “Ancillary fees aren’t optional add-ons; they’re lifelines … these fees fund the essential services that help students stay in school, stay healthy, and succeed in contributing to a better Ontario.”\nAttack on diversity?\nThe Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance, Spooner and David Robinson, executive director of CAUT, have questioned the government’s soothing words about merit-based admissions.\n“We have no idea what the government means by ‘merit’,” said Spooner. “If it’s simply high school grades, which is how admissions are largely decided, that’s inherently unfair.\n“Students in poorer areas of the province or who don’t come from families with cultural capital cannot be ‘equal’ in the so-called ‘merit-based’ system. Parents’ graduating from college or university is still the strongest predictor of success in post-secondary institutions,” he said.\nSpooner continued: “But how can it [a merit-based system] take into account a student who had good, but not great grades but was working part-time to support her family or take care of younger siblings?\n“How can it take into account the hundreds of thousands of new Canadians who came here relatively recently and whose education in their countries of origin was badly disrupted?\n“What the government is proposing is uncomfortably close to the attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion in the United States.”\nFor his part, Robinson said: “Merit is often a code word for you can’t recognise historical disadvantage. So, someone with a disability, for instance, would have to be judged at the same level as someone without a disability; this is contrary to the entire human rights framework in Canada.\n“It would be open to a challenge under Ontario’s Human Rights Act, not to mention the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in the Constitution.\n“I’ve heard the government say, well, that's not what we mean. We just mean we just want more transparency. We want institutions to publish how they select and what the criteria is for selection of students.\n“I think where it also runs into some constitutional challenges is we have a lot of federal programs and incentives for Indigenous students, again, recognising historical injustices there and providing pathways for Indigenous students.\n“Is that something that the bill would make more difficult or would impede? If it does, then I think you're into a constitutional and jurisdictional issue.”\nA dire need for funding\nCritics charge that Bill 33 threatens university autonomy by giving the government the power to override a key element of academic freedom.\n“Universities in Canada have long held the authority to determine admission decisions. They, staffed by experts, should be the ones determining what the criteria are to enter a programme,” said Spooner.\nRobinson agreed. “One of the key elements of university autonomy is the right of institutions to set their own admissions criteria free of government or outside interests.\n“So, this is a pretty dangerous one, and again, we have to see what the actual regulations of the legislation are, but it really sets a dangerous precedent,” he stated.\nAt the end of our interview, Robinson stepped back and said that “one of the really ironic things that we see across the country, but also arguably around the world, is that as governments defund institutions, they’re also demanding more control over the institutions”.\n“You would think that as they give more funding, they would want more control, but actually, the opposite seems to be true.\n“Right now in Ontario, we have a terrible situation where, rather than focusing on the real issue, which is a system that is in utter crisis right now in terms of funding, we’re seeing programme closures, layoffs and suspensions of enrolments.\n“They want to have transparent criteria around how you get into a system that’s falling apart.\n“I think they should really focus their attention on what the core issue is, and that is: we need to find a sustainable funding model for our post-secondary education system because, right now, we have a system that is in dire need of some funding,” said Robinson.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

It examines a growing pattern across institutions: the deployment of symbolic reforms in place of structural change.\nFrom online degrees to AI platforms and DEI dashboards (diversity, equity and inclusion), higher education has entered an era of political placebo – well-publicised, high-investment efforts that offer the appearance of innovation while leaving core challenges unaddressed.\nIn medicine, a placebo relieves symptoms without addressing the underlying condition. In higher education, it obscures institutional fragility, public disillusionment and the slow erosion of pedagogy. The result is a perilous illusion: reform without substance, change without consequence.\nWhen institutions perform progress\nThe modern university is under pressure as enrolment declines, funding stagnates, and public trust erodes. In response, many institutions turn to symbolic innovations – online programmes, AI-driven classrooms, expanded DEI initiatives and strategic ‘future-ready’ plans.\nThese are not inherently bad. But in practice, they often serve as gestures of reassurance rather than engines of renewal.\nWhat emerges is a familiar cycle: announce, automate, outsource. Beneath the polished surface, tenure disappears, faculty voices are marginalised, student-faculty interaction declines, and the university’s mission is quietly recast from public good to credential factory.\nCase 1: Online degrees – Access without integrity\nThe University of Phoenix, once lauded for expanding access, now serves as a cautionary tale. In a recent partnership with ManpowerGroup, it offered no-cost educational upskilling for workers. But the programme relied on algorithmic grading, rapid course completion, and asynchronous delivery with minimal faculty contact.\nThe University of Arizona Global Campus, formerly Ashford University, faced a US$21 million judgment for deceptive recruitment practices, followed by over US$70 million in federal loan forgiveness for misled students.\nAt the centre of this ecosystem are online programme managers (OPMs) like 2U, Pearson and Academic Partnerships, which handle marketing, enrolment, and course design in exchange for up to 60% of tuition.\nA 2022 US Government Accountability Office report warned that these opaque partnerships drive up costs and weaken educational accountability.\nThe result is access that often lacks academic rigour, mentorship or integrity – a digital credential system that rewards throughput, not transformation.\nCase 2: Edtech – Innovation without pedagogy\nAcross global school systems, educational technology is often promoted as a remedy for stagnation. However, its implementation frequently overlooks pedagogical foundations.\nIn Baltimore County Public Schools (BCPS) in Maryland, a notable initiative is the launch of an artificial intelligence programme within its Career and Technical Education offerings.\nApproved by the Maryland State Department of Education, the programme officially began in the 2023-2024 academic year and is currently active at George Washington Carver Center for Arts and Technology, Sollers Point Technical High School, and Western School of Technology and Environmental Science.\nDesigned to equip students with foundational knowledge and practical skills in AI – including coding, machine learning, and the societal implications of intelligent systems – the programme reflects BCPS’s broader commitment to integrating advanced technological education into its curriculum and preparing students for careers in a rapidly evolving digital economy.\nWhile such programmes are well-intentioned, they illustrate a broader trend where educational technology is adopted more for its symbolic value than for demonstrable pedagogical effectiveness.\nThis pattern is not unique to BCPS; globally, ministries of education, under political and economic pressures, often enter into contracts with technology vendors. These decisions are frequently driven by the desire to appear modern and innovative, rather than by evidence-based assessments of educational value.\nConsequently, the adoption of new platforms becomes a policy in itself, and innovation is reduced to a series of press releases, rather than substantive improvements in teaching and learning.\nThis phenomenon underscores the need for a more critical and pedagogically grounded approach to integrating technology in education, ensuring that such initiatives genuinely enhance learning outcomes rather than merely serving as symbols of progress.\nThe dilemma of investment and image\nOver the past two decades, universities have invested billions in educational technologies, including hardware, software, infrastructure, analytics platforms, and AI-based learning systems.\nThese investments, often framed as necessary modernisation, have become a non-negotiable condition of institutional relevance.\nBut with every new contract, dashboard or predictive model, a deeper paradox emerges.\nThe dilemma is twofold: institutions must adopt technology to maintain credibility in the public eye, and yet the results rarely match the rhetoric. There is a growing sense – within faculty meetings, student forums and alumni circles – that these transformations often serve image more than substance.\nWhen institutions allocate more resources to digital platforms than to faculty development, or when an AI-powered chatbot represents student support, it raises the question: Who is this truly benefiting?\nIronically, the pressure to demonstrate equity has become a driver of inequality. As media attention highlights the digital divide, universities scramble to appear proactive. Neglecting to invest in technology invites accusations of negligence.\nHowever, investing in the wrong tools – costly, untested and frequently unexamined – results in performance without true transformation.\nThis creates a peculiar bind: universities must integrate technology or face public backlash. But the very act of integration, when done reactively or performatively, becomes a political placebo. It calms the public, satisfies media demands, and secures donor confidence.\nMeanwhile, students still struggle with access, faculty remain underpaid, and core pedagogical questions are outsourced to algorithms and IT departments.\nEdtech, in this sense, is no longer just a toolset; it has become a social performance. The promise of transformation is recited like a liturgy, but the outcomes remain shallow and uneven.\nUntil institutions reckon with the deeper structural commitments – funding, pedagogy, labour and purpose – technology will remain less a solution than a stage.\nThe societal cost: Inflation, inequality, incoherence\nThe placebo effect is not confined to the campus. Its consequences ripple outward, shaping how society experiences education, debt, and democratic possibility.\nWhen universities charge six-figure sums for online degrees, they normalise debt as a precondition for progress. Student loan debt in the United States now exceeds US$1.77 trillion. According to the Federal Reserve, nearly one in five borrowers is behind on payments or in default.\nThis debt burden delays home ownership, family formation and social mobility. It erodes the very promise education is meant to offer.\nThe effect is regressive. Students from lower-income backgrounds borrow more, default more often, and face greater long-term consequences – all in pursuit of credentials that increasingly fail to deliver economic stability.\nThe College Board reports that average tuition and fees at private four-year institutions have more than doubled in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1993.\nMeanwhile, the push toward innovation, absent pedagogical coherence, has produced an epistemic drift. Students are promised agile skills for dynamic economies but graduate into job markets that neither need nor recognise their credentials. Disillusionment grows. The commodification of learning weakens its legitimacy.\nAt the same time, universities expand programmes on the backs of precarious labour. Adjunct faculty, the backbone of instructional delivery in many institutions, juggle multiple gigs, earn subsistence wages, and are denied health benefits or academic freedom. The illusion of digital progress is often built atop invisible exploitation.\nTrust in higher education declines, not because of anti-intellectualism, but because institutions have sold transformation and delivered transaction. This is the deeper cost of the political placebo: not just symbolic failure but the degradation of higher education as a public good.\nThe landscape of symbols and silences\nNot all institutions experience the political placebo effect in the same way, but all are shaped by it. Whether elite or under-resourced, private or public, research-intensive or teaching-focused, universities now operate within an ecosystem in which symbolism substitutes for substance.\nThe pressure to conform – to appear innovative, inclusive, efficient and future-ready – transcends institutional mission or identity.\nThis results in a peculiar kind of symbolic convergence. The elite university cloaks its power in tradition and neutral expertise, while the struggling college adopts the language of digital transformation to survive austerity.\nBoth reach for dashboards, slogans and rankings to assert credibility. And both displace the deeper work of education – relationships, reflection, intellectual risk – with polished representations.\nThis is more than branding. It is a culture of simulation. Logos replace legacies. Curriculum flexibility becomes a euphemism for incoherence. Student satisfaction surveys stand in for deep learning. Metrics dominate because they are legible, not because they are meaningful.\nEven differences between institutions – community colleges and Ivy Leagues, rural campuses and urban research hubs – are flattened by this performance logic.\nThe former, once engines of democratic access, are now judged by the same productivity metrics as the latter. Diversity of purpose is lost to homogeneity of image.\nThis uniformity conceals inequality. The tools of prestige are deployed across vastly unequal conditions, creating the illusion of parity where structural gaps persist. When every institution claims transformation, none are required to prove it.\nTo move beyond this, we must stop asking who is doing it better and start asking: better for what? Better for whom? Only then can we begin to recover the plurality of educational purposes – and resist the flattening force of comparison that sustains the placebo effect.\nToward purpose-driven reform\nWhat higher education needs is not another platform, initiative or rebranding campaign – but a return to its deeper commitments: critical inquiry, public service and human development. That will require not just new tools but new ethics – grounded in transparency, relational pedagogy and epistemic justice.\nThere are signs of hope. Some institutions are reevaluating their contracts with OPMs. Faculty unions are challenging algorithmic management. Open-source, community-driven platforms are gaining ground. Educators worldwide are asking whether true learning can ever be scalable – or whether scale itself is the illusion.\nBreaking the spell\nPlacebos persist not because they deceive, but because they soothe. Political placebos endure because they offer reassurance without rupture. But real education begins with rupture – with the refusal to confuse activity with purpose, metrics with meaning, or visibility with value.\nTo break the spell, universities must recover the moral and civic dimensions of their work. They must centre relationships over rankings, care over compliance, and presence over platform. They must fund the humanities not for their return on investment but because they ask what investment is for.\nStudents must no longer be treated as consumers of content but as co-creators of knowledge. They must be invited into the generational task of reclaiming education from its instrumentalisation and returning it to its ethical and democratic roots.\nPolicymakers must stop treating education as a marketplace and start treating it as social infrastructure. Like bridges or hospitals, universities cannot be built on branding alone. They require public investment, labour protections and accountability – not to growth, but to justice.\nAnd as a society, we must resist the lie that progress is always sleek, scalable and digital. Sometimes, true transformation looks like an adjunct receiving a living wage, a student seeing themselves in the curriculum, or a teacher granted the time to listen deeply.\nThe university cannot be saved by simulation. It must be reconstituted as a space of truth-telling, intellectual humility and presence. This work is slow. It is difficult. But it is the only future worth building.\nJames Yoonil Auh is the chair of computing and communications engineering at KyungHee Cyber University in South Korea. He has worked across the United States, Asia and Latin America on projects linking ethics, technology and education policy.\nThis article is a commentary.

The disciplinary actions were confirmed in news reports published around 3 June 2025.\nThe sit-in was part of broader protest action during which protesters accused the university of complicity in the Gaza conflict, calling for divestment from arms manufacturers and an end to academic ties with Israeli universities. They renamed the Arts West Building, the site of a larger occupation, “Mahmoud’s Hall”.\nVice-Chancellor Professor Emma Johnston defended the university’s actions. She told University World News: “The university respects the rights of individuals to protest – this has not changed.\nUniversities are places where free and open debate must take place, but the safety of our students and staff must also be protected, as this is integral to enabling free and open debate.”\nA university spokesperson told University World News that some students had reported feeling “safer accessing our buildings” following a rule introduced in March 2025 banning indoor protests.\nThat regulation – part of the vice-chancellor’s broader powers – prohibits indoor demonstrations, any protest that obstructs entrances or exits, and disruptions to university operations.\nThe university also clarified that more than 16,800 students had their classes disrupted during the 2024 Arts West occupation, which contributed to the new policy.\nStill, critics see the policy – and the disciplinary actions – as part of a broader crackdown on student activism.\nPolitical ally\nThe Australian Greens party Deputy Leader Mehreen Faruqi has become one of the most vocal political allies of the disciplined students. “This is not about disruption – it’s about suppression,” Faruqi said at a press conference earlier this week.\n“We’re seeing a systematic campaign to silence students who are speaking out against injustice.”\nThat sentiment is echoed across student unions, legal scholars, and civil rights organisations. Amnesty International Australia has raised concerns that the university’s actions may infringe upon fundamental human rights, including freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.\nDana Alshaer, a prominent organiser with UniMelb for Palestine, has publicly expressed concerns about the University of Melbourne’s disciplinary actions against pro-Palestinian student protesters.\nShe was quoted by Anadolu Agency, saying she believed the misconduct allegations were a punishment for students who defied the university’s ties with weapons manufacturers rather than the sit-in itself.\nThe University of Melbourne has declined to comment on individual cases, citing confidentiality, but sources confirm that the disciplinary process has concluded and affected students have the right to appeal.\nImplications for free speech\nStudents and academics have also raised concerns about the methods used to identify protesters. Reports indicate that the university relied on internal security, surveillance footage, and Wi-Fi data to track students’ locations during the protests, practices civil liberties groups warn could have chilling implications for free speech.\nThe National Tertiary Education Union (NTEU) has recently and publicly condemned the University of Melbourne's disciplinary actions against students involved in pro-Palestinian protests.\nIn a media release dated 3 June 2025, the NTEU University of Melbourne branch expressed strong opposition to the expulsions and suspensions, stating: “The decision to suspend and expel students represents an unacceptable intensification of authoritarianism on campus.”\nThe NTEU also criticised the university’s increased surveillance measures, including electronic and Wi-Fi monitoring, and the banning of indoor and “disruptive” protests. They argue that these actions suppress academic and political freedom.\nThe reaction to the protest indicates a fundamental shift in how Australian universities relate to political activism.\nProfessor Joo-Cheong Tham from the Melbourne Law School noted in an op-ed on this matter that in the 1960s and 1970s, Australian university campuses were hotbeds of protest against the Vietnam War, apartheid, and censorship.\nHe wrote in The Conversation: “In more recent years, students have protested on key social, political and environmental issues, from university fees to the invasion of Iraq and climate action. This protest history feeds into the broader purposes of universities.\nUniversities act as a modern-day ‘public square’. This means they are a place where ideas can be freely debated and difficult issues can be explored. In this way, they act as a key component of a free and healthy democracy.”\nA worrying precedent\nSome see the formalisation of new restrictions – no indoor protests, designated protest zones, and mandatory approval for political signage – as disproportionately targeting the pro-Palestine cause while setting a worrying precedent for all future activism.\nBesides the University of Melbourne, for instance, at the University of Sydney, a new Campus Access Policy was introduced in July 2024, requiring students and staff to give 72 hours' notice for demonstrations and approval for the use of megaphones or putting up posters.\nA survey by the NTEU found that nearly 40% of university staff now feel pressured to avoid political content in their teaching, a figure that has doubled since 2022.\nThe controversy has spilt into federal politics.\nThe Greens have tabled a motion calling for an independent inquiry into free speech and disciplinary procedures at Australian universities. They argue that higher education must remain a space for “dissent, not punishment”.\nThe ruling Labor Party has remained largely silent, while the Coalition has taken a hardline stance.\n“Universities must be places of higher learning, not indoctrination,” said Coalition’s Shadow Education Minister Sarah Henderson.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

This success has been driven by the Emirates’ reputation for safety, flexible visa regulations, governmental support and forward-looking academic programmes.\nFor the 2024 to 2025 academic year, 42,026 students enrolled at 41 private higher education institutions in Dubai, of which 37 are international campuses.\nThe number of international students increased by 29% on the previous year, while Emirati student enrolment grew by a record 22%, according to Dubai’s Knowledge and Human Development Authority[/url] (KHDA).\nPrivate higher education is strong in Dubai, whereas there are only a handful of public universities, which include branch campuses of Abu Dhabi’s Zayed University and Dubai’s Mohammed bin Rashid University of Medicine and Health Sciences. The Dubai government last year announced the creation of Dubai National University.\nLeading HE hub\n“The UAE has rapidly emerged as a leading higher education hub, particularly since the early 2000s, with significant growth in the past decade.\n“Strategic government investment, education-friendly policies, and partnerships with globally ranked universities have positioned the country as a top destination for quality international education,” said Gary Fernandes, associate regional director of the prospect experience and global admissions hub at Heriot-Watt University Dubai, a satellite campus of the Scottish university.\nEnrolment for Heriot-Watt's September 2024 and January 2025 Dubai intakes increased by 4.5% year on year, to 5,100 students from 125 nationalities.\nIndicative of the growth of private higher education in Dubai, Middlesex University Dubai started in 2005 with just 28 students and today has over 6,300 students from over 127 countries.\n“This demand continues to rise, and we anticipate further growth from key markets such as China, Saudi Arabia and Egypt over the next decade, in addition to the strong base across the Indian subcontinent, Africa, the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries [which includes the UAE], and Europe,” said Professor Cedwyn Fernandes, pro-vice chancellor and director of Middlesex University Dubai, a satellite campus of the English university.\n“These students are not just contributing to enrolment numbers; they are helping shape the future of education in the UAE, driving demand for new programmes, strengthening institutional ties across regions, and ensuring that campuses remain multicultural and globally relevant,” Fernandes noted.\nThere are 706 programmes at the Emirate's 41 private higher education institutions, with 91 new programmes offered this past year. Programme specialisations with the highest growth are business, at 39%; engineering, at 15%; information technology (IT), at 13%; media and design, at 8%; and education, at 5%, according to the KHDA.\nBy nationality, students from India account for 42% of enrolments, while 9% come from across the UAE's seven Emirates, 7% from Pakistan, 4% from Egypt, 3% from Russia and Jordan, respectively, and 2% from China, the Philippines, Syria and Lebanon, respectively, according to KHDA, which did not give further information on student nationalities.\nAn attractive option\nIndia’s Symbiosis International University opened a campus in Dubai in 2024 and has seen strong enrolment, Dr Anita Patankar, the branch's executive director, told University World News.\n“While Indian students from across the world continue to form a core part of our student community, we're seeing growing interest from across the GCC, Africa, and Southeast Asia,” she said.\nTougher visa requirements for international students in the United States and Europe, as well as funding cuts for higher education over the past year, have also driven up enrolments in Dubai, other Gulf universities and at private universities in Lebanon, academics told University World News.\nPatankar said there has been a “clear global shift” in student preferences for “academic quality, personal safety, and long-term opportunity” in recent years.\n“With growing concerns about changing visa policies, political instability, and reduced public funding in traditional study destinations, students and their families are actively seeking environments that offer clarity, security, and future-focused learning,” she said.\nThe UAE also offers Golden Visas (for investors, entrepreneurs and talented professionals) and Green Visa schemes (for skilled individuals, freelancers or the self-employed), which allow for long-term residency for students, researchers and skilled professionals.\nSaleh Yammout, vice president of finance and administration at RIT Dubai, a branch campus of Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) New York, said demand for private higher education in Dubai has surged since 2021, following the post-pandemic recovery and economic diversification efforts.\nRIT Dubai now caters to 4,500 students and has introduced six research and innovation centres aligned with UAE national government priorities: energy and sustainability; advanced manufacturing; entrepreneurship; smart cities; accessibility; and future foresight.\n“We are also scaling faculty recruitment, expanding programme offerings, and strengthening industry partnerships,” Yammout told University World News.\nHe said that contributing factors to Dubai’s popularity were its strategic location, English-language instruction, internationally recognised degrees, strong employment prospects and a high standard of living.\n“The country's tolerance, diversity and emphasis on safety make it an ideal choice for families considering overseas education,” said Yammout.\nDemand for specific subjects\nMiddlesex University’s Fernandes said there has been a shift over the past five to 10 years in demand for certain subjects. “While traditional fields like business, IT, finance, education, and media studies remain strong, there is growing demand for specialised, future-focused areas,” he said, noting this shift is closely tied to the Dubai Economic Agenda (D33), which prioritises innovation and technology and seeks a doubling in the size of the Emirates’ economy over the next decade.\nA key means of achieving this is attracting the world’s best universities and digitalising the economy.\n“AI is particularly central to this evolution. With the launch of initiatives like the Dubai AI Campus [a cluster of AI companies] and the integration of AI into national school curricula, the UAE is aligning its educational vision with its AI Strategy 2031, preparing students not just to participate in this transformation but to lead it,” said Patankar.\nSymbiosis University is one of five Indian universities with campuses in Dubai and is benefitting from India-UAE bilateral cooperation in education.\nThe UAE and the wider Gulf region’s demand for business leaders and programmes to diversify the economy has seen strong demand for undergraduate programmes in business and MBA programmes: “Over 70% of our current MBA cohort are already interning with leading companies in Dubai, gaining valuable real-world experience alongside classroom learning,” said Patankar.\nYammout said at RIT Dubai there has been a shift towards technology-focused and innovation-driven programmes: “High-demand areas include cybersecurity, computing programmes, data analytics, and sustainable engineering. We've also seen growing interest in psychology, new media and design, and innovation-led business programmes,” he said.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

However, she argued: “If we want to have a longer-term impact, we really have to have sustained partnerships.”\nSustained partnerships with the community are what the University of Pretoria (UP) in South Africa is developing, and last year, a six-member team from Germany’s University of Konstanz visited UP to learn more about their community engagement programmes.\nSouth African toolkit\nDr Martina Jordaan, head of community engagement at UP, said the institution, which has 56,000 students spread over seven campuses and nine faculties, builds community engagement into 226 modules and involves more than 20,000 students working at 323 sites.\nLast year, in collaboration with its community partners, who are also co-opted to monitor and evaluate student assignments, UP prepared an impact-focused toolkit to assist lecturers involved in curriculum-based community engagement modules “to show them what the steps are and how they get to the point where we want to be”, she said.\n“The idea of this toolbox is to guide universities to identify current community engagement practices, reflect on the achievements and areas for improvement in the engagement efforts, and engage in collaborative discussions with community stakeholders to develop the most strategic and impactful approach to the community engagement,” said Jordaan.\nAsked by University World News how the university ensured that the community is not exploited in the process, she said: “We really tried to make the community partners co-designers of the courses. And it's very important that they also take the responsibility to assess the coursework or the outcomes of the projects and what the students did with them.\n“Making them co-facilitators makes them more responsible. We want to move them to the point of being mentors instead of just observers and acceptors. And if they are mentors later on, then that is part of the development of the community”.\nUP’s Moja Gabedi gardening project is a good example of how this process works. Just four years ago the Moja Gabedi site, close to the university in Hatfield, was an eyesore, buried under 3,000 tonnes of garbage and attracting criminal elements.\nUP’s Unit for Community Engagement got the university’s agriculture and occupational therapy students to work with the community as part of their studies.\nNow, the space is a farmland producing 100% organic vegetables and fruit for the community, and the occupational therapy students conduct life-changing healing sessions with homeless people drawn from the local community. It has become an example of how a university can regenerate a ruined space with the community.\nJordaan told University World News the students develop personally and have an enriching experience in the process. “The students are most responsible if the community is actually assisting them,” she said.\nAustralian pathways approach\nDr Megan Donnelly, director of societal impact and evaluation at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney, said the university has embedded societal impact into its new 10-year strategy. The strategy has nine pillars, she said, with five pillars representing impact pathways and four representing impact focus areas.\n“The impact pathways are essentially a bit more typical of a university. They are about our transformative education, our innovative research, our genuine engagement with our partnerships and our communities,” said Donnelly.\n“Our impact pathway four is around our culture and our people, and five is around improving our environment so that we're more agile and more effective in the way that we work,” she noted.\nDonnelly said the impact focus areas are what differentiate this strategy “from the rest” and are currently being applied to the special educational needs of Australia’s indigenous people, which have been neglected for generations. As a result, their involvement with higher education has been negligible.\nAccording to Donnelly, Australia’s schoolchildren have also grown up with very little knowledge of the Aboriginal perspectives of their history and culture.\nUNSW has employed several Indigenous-identified staff and works in close partnership with a range of Aboriginal communities to develop new curriculum material on Aboriginal culture for the local Little Bay Community for Schools.\nFirst-year UNSW students also undertake a community-based course called Indigenous Perspectives in Education, with Indigenous perspectives embedded in every course in their first-year programme.\n“Cross-cutting themes such as inclusion, integrity, social justice and indigenous knowledges are critical to how we pursue all of our impact focus areas. And they will also be critical to the way that we measure impact across our strategic initiatives,” said Donnelly.\n“The purpose of impact evaluation is essentially to capture and elevate the impact across everything that we do,” she said. “So it’s not just research and education, although they are obviously core, but also how we engage – and our operations and governance practices as well. And the goal is to keep us accountable for societal change.”\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Sarlin's Foundation PS, for example, has funded over a dozen professorships at Finnish universities that are co-affiliated with the ELLIS Institute.\nThese universities include Aalto University, the Hanken School of Economics, Helsinki University, the University of the Arts Helsinki, University of Eastern Finland, University of Jyväskylä, University of Lapland, National Defence University, University of Oulu, Tampere University, the University of Vaasa, University of Turku, and Åbo Akademi University.\nCommenting on the benefits of Sarlin’s investment on the webpage of Foundation PS, Major General Mika Kalliomaa, rector of the National Defence University, said: “This important investment shows Peter Sarlin’s precise understanding of the need for improvement of AI knowledge and research in Finland.\n“This donation boosts the National Defence University’s academic AI research and studies within military sciences, defence and the context of comprehensive security.\n“It enables wide and fruitful possibilities to join the ELLIS network and to share and to receive expertise. Along with this donation, the National Defence University will establish a new AI professorship.”\nCommenting on the pre-launch of the ELLIS Institute on her Facebook page, Minister Talvitie wrote: “Happy to participate in the ceremonial ribbon-cutting duties at Aalto University! The new ELLIS Institute focusing on artificial intelligence research has now opened.\n“We are funding the ELLIS Institute with 40 million euros this term, and on top of this, a private donation from the Peter Sarlin Foundation is funding artificial intelligence professorships at universities across Finland in various disciplines.\n“Finnish artificial intelligence research is not only of a very high standard but also widely known worldwide”.\nThe importance of partners\nSpeaking at the pre-launch event, Kaski said: “We are scaling up the institute very quickly, with the first principal investigator recruitments currently being finalised and other operations kickstarting …\n“We aim to renew the very core of R&D by making machine learning better and more widely applicable and want to partner across academia and industry to make this happen.\n“Companies and society at large are now beginning to benefit from the wealth of basic research in AI and machine learning, but it is also obvious that many important problems have not been solved yet,” said Kaski.\n“We need research on new fundamentals that make machine learning more applicable, and we are also setting up ‘new fundamentals’ in how we work with partners to solve those problems with our combined expertise.”\nThe ELLIS Institute Finland is the second institute in ELLIS, the pan-European AI network of excellence founded in 2018 to focus on fundamental science, technical innovation and societal impact. The first ELLIS Institute was established in 2023 in Tübingen, Germany.\nFor researchers, the new institute offers a dynamic, international research environment; access to cutting-edge computing resources, including the European High-Performance Computing (EuroHPC) LUMI (Large Unified Modern Infrastructure) supercomputer; and has close ties to both academia and industry in Finland and beyond.\nThe European High-Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) is pooling European resources to develop top-of-the-range exascale supercomputers for processing big data, based on competitive European technology.\nPan-European pre-exascale supercomputer LUMI is located in CSC’s data centre in Kajaani, Finland, and is hosted by the LUMI consortium made up of Finland, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Iceland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, and Switzerland. LUMI is one of the world’s best-known scientific instruments for the lifespan of 2021-2027.\nInternational competition\nBernhard Schölkopf, scientific director of ELLIS Institute Tübingen and president of ELLIS, said: “The European AI community has been arguing that our governments ought to face the international competition in AI and the implied challenges for our societies.\n“Building on a broad effort of public and private funding, Finland’s announcement to found an ELLIS institute is forward-looking and sends a strong signal that this message is being taken seriously.”\nThe ELLIS Institute in Finland builds on the long track record of pioneering machine learning research at the Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence (FCAI), which currently hosts ELLIS Unit Helsinki, the local node of ELLIS that will be expanded into the new institute.\nKaski, who is the director of FCAI and the ELLIS Unit Helsinki, said: “Finland has been a forerunner in AI, and the ELLIS Institute will take us to the next level of quality and global attractiveness to experts.”\nThe dean of the faculty of science and computer science, Professor Sasu Tarkoma, told University World News that the University of Helsinki has a particularly strong research record in machine learning (including its mathematical foundations), language technology (notably large-language models), and broad interdisciplinary AI.\n\"The new ELLIS Institute builds on and expands the excellent collaboration among the University of Helsinki, Aalto University, and VTT [Technical Research Centre of Finland, one of Europe's leading research institutions] through our joint FCAI flagship programme. We are thrilled to receive this funding from the ministry to establish the institute,” Tarkoma said.\nHuman-centric AI\nSarlin told University World News the launch marked an important milestone for Finland and the broader European ecosystem, building as it did on “unique strengths to advance impactful, human-centric AI”.\nHe said the institute will host world-class talent rooted in academic excellence and a strong innovation culture; enjoy deep collaboration between research and industry, turning science into real-world solutions; pursue a shared vision for trustworthy AI that serves people, society, and industry across Europe; and represent a talent ecosystem that attracts the most talented people – creating critical mass and momentum.\n“A big thank you to everyone who made this possible through their hard work and dedication. The future of AI is being built here, and Foundation PS is honoured to contribute,” Sarlin said.\nKaski, who is currently sharing his time as a professor at both Aalto University and the University of Manchester, told University World News Finland had a strong history in artificial intelligence and machine learning research.\n“The establishment of the ELLIS Institute owes a lot to these foundations, and thanks to the partnership of 13 Finnish universities and the vital support of Finland’s Ministry of Education and Culture and philanthropist Peter Sarlin, we were able to seize the moment.\n“ELLIS represents the 1000+ best machine learning researchers in Europe, and it is an engaged community where it’s easy to collaborate – and in a small country like Finland, this collaboration is natural and a necessity.

This moment demands a response and solidarity from the global higher education community.\nBut how does starvation affect Gaza’s educators? What are the broader implications for the academic community and the future of higher education in Gaza? And how can we meaningfully support educators in Gaza and other conflict-affected regions experiencing starvation?\nIn a widely circulated video in Arabic from Al Jazeera Mubasher, a 68-year-old Palestinian man, Samir El Kabariti, is seen weeping. He tells the interviewer he has not eaten in two days and is searching for bread – or anything at all. Samir is now a wheelchair user, alone in his search for food for himself, his wife and his daughter. His son and his son’s entire family were killed in an Israeli airstrike. Another son survived but sustained serious injuries.\nOne viewer recognised Samir and wrote: “This is not just any man. This was my Arabic teacher. Seeing him today – broken by hunger, injustice and qaher [deep, searing bitterness] – my heart breaks. May Allah help you, my teacher, and help our people in Gaza.”\nThis testimony is not an isolated case. It represents the devastation Gaza’s educators face and the profound implications starvation holds for the academic fabric of the region.\nSystematic starvation\nAs Israel’s war on Gaza continues, Palestinians, including educators, are being subjected to what the UN Human Rights Special Rapporteur has warned may constitute ethnic cleansing, with the intent to displace the population permanently. Human Rights Watch has documented that starvation is being used as a weapon of war.\nSince October 2023, the trickle of aid into Gaza has been extremely inadequate. Aid convoys have been blocked, delayed or attacked by Israeli settlers with little intervention from the military. Within Gaza, aid distribution is hampered by security threats to both workers and recipients.\nIn one example, Israeli forces killed seven aid workers from the World Central Kitchen. Its founder, José Andrés, reported they were targeted “systematically, car by car”.\nUN relief official Tom Fletcher stated that humanitarian workers are being killed at unprecedented rates. Thirty-one civilians were recently shot dead while trying to collect aid at a US-backed distribution point. Philippe Lazzarini, the commissioner-general of UNRWA, the UN relief agency for Palestinian refugees, has stated: “Aid distribution has become a death trap”.\nThe crisis is further worsened by restrictions and defunding of UNRWA. Israel’s parliament has tried to halt its operations entirely, undermining the principal humanitarian lifeline for people in the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\nSevere fuel shortages, blocked or damaged transport routes, mass displacement and the destruction of water and sanitation systems have further crippled humanitarian operations, putting the whole population at risk, particularly the most vulnerable such as those suffering from injuries, pregnant women and those with chronic diseases.\nDespite the International Court of Justice (ICJ) finding that Israel’s actions plausibly amount to genocide and ordering the facilitation of aid, Israel has reportedly failed to comply.\nAccording to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Gaza’s population has dropped by 6% since the war began. Over 54,000 have been killed, more than 124,000 injured and many others remain missing. The remaining 2.1 million residents face risk of famine. At the time of writing, Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, called Gaza “the hungriest place on Earth”.\nDespite this, Gaza’s academic community continues to resist displacement. Students, educators and administrators strive to maintain a semblance of educational life in the hope of rebuilding when the war ends.\nAn educational crisis\nStarvation must not be viewed solely as a health or humanitarian issue – it is also an education emergency. Since October 2023, all of Gaza’s universities have been destroyed. Yet, some institutions remain partially functional, offering lectures and exams through virtual platforms. This resilience, though remarkable, remains fragile, and deepening hunger risks undermining these efforts if urgent support is not provided.\nImmediate impacts include poor attendance, increased dropout rates and early marriage – particularly affecting girls, whose higher education opportunities become curtailed.\nMalnutrition-related fatigue, anxiety and psychological distress also affect both student performance and academic staff productivity.\nThe broader social consequences are equally concerning. As hunger deepens, people grow desperate. Survival imperatives can drive self-centred or even aggressive behaviour, increasing competition for scarce resources. Trust begins to erode, and a fear of others sets in, disrupting the collaborative, communal spirit essential to any functioning university, now, and in the future.\nThis deterioration is not theoretical. In Gaza’s tightly knit neighbourhoods, where social norms have traditionally discouraged theft or dishonour, hunger is driving acts that were once rare. These include looting, especially in northern Gaza where aid remains largely inaccessible.\nPrior to the war, such actions carried not just legal consequences but intense social stigma, often extending shame to an entire family. The normalisation of these breakdowns marks a rupture in civil society itself – one that will directly affect universities, whose faculty, staff and students are drawn almost entirely from the local community.\nThe crisis takes on an even deeper cultural and psychological dimension when educators – historically respected figures in Gaza – are reduced to begging for food. In the widely shared incident, cited above, El Kabariti, recognised as a revered teacher, was seen pleading for sustenance. For his former students, this was not merely a scene of individual suffering – it represented a collective psychological wound, a breakdown of the very ideals that once anchored their sense of self and society.\nStarvation leads to trauma\nStarvation leads to significant psychological trauma: humiliation, helplessness, social withdrawal and a deep sense of futility. Dr Mahmoud Assaf, an academic and author, recounted being offered money by a clay oven owner to burn his library books as cooking fuel.\nTorn between preserving Gaza’s intellectual heritage and feeding his starving children, he said in an Arabic video interview by Al Jazeera Mubasher: “I was shocked when a local oven owner called and offered to buy what remained of my library – to use as firewood. For a moment, I actually considered it. I stood at a crossroads between two unbearable choices: the hollow, hungry eyes of my children suffering through hunger and deprivation – or the preservation of Gaza’s academic and cultural legacy, knowing I may never return to the place where it now remains.”\nWhen Assaf shared his dilemma online, many responded with pleas not to sell the library, assuring him that the hardship would pass. But to him, their words felt distant, almost meaningless. “I don’t think people truly grasp what we’re living through. My children need shoes. They need food – something, anything – to silence their hunger,” he said.\nHis most recent book is titled How Many Deaths Want to Claim Us? and its sequel, A Lifetime Equals Zero. Despite his credentials and contributions, Assaf was living in a tent at the time of the interview.\nStarvation also carries long-term health consequences. It can impair people’s cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, immune and reproductive systems, leading to both visible and invisible disabilities.\nThese, in turn, create new challenges for teaching, learning and university infrastructure.\nA future at risk\nThe consequences of starvation in Gaza risk reverberating across generations. High mortality rates and developmental delays in children threaten to erode the territory’s future intellectual and professional capacity. Malnutrition in early life has been shown to result in long-term damage to health, cognitive development and socio-economic potential.\nAs Muriithi Wanjiku G explains, malnutrition affects physical growth and health outcomes, often leading to stunting, wasting and nutritional deficiency diseases such as anaemia and impaired organ development.\nIn adulthood, it increases the risk of non-communicable diseases, including diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. Its impact on cognitive development and education is equally profound. Malnutrition can impair brain development, disrupting the formation and function of neural connections, and hinder core cognitive functions such as language acquisition, memory, attention and problem-solving. These effects severely compromise educational attainment and future economic prospects.\nThe potential loss of future generations of educated youth is compounded by the current brain drain. As conditions deteriorate, experts who once chose to stay are now forced to reconsider.\nDr Khamis El Essi, a neuro-rehabilitation specialist and professor at the Islamic University of Gaza, described his internal conflict in an interview with TRT Arabi.\nHe said: “I received job offers from abroad that promised better salaries, better opportunities and a better life. But I chose to stay – because so few specialist doctors remained in Gaza, and people needed help. Three or four months into the war, I began to reconsider – not for my own sake, but for the safety of my children.”\nEl Essi has been displaced more than a dozen times and, like many of his colleagues, has received no salary since the war began. He now survives by selling his remaining possessions and occasionally relies on the support of friends and neighbours.\nThe cumulative effects of starvation, displacement and economic collapse are not only destroying lives – they are dismantling the foundations of Gaza’s future.\nHow the global academic community can help\nThe global academic community can take meaningful action.\nImmediate steps:\n• Advocate for a permanent ceasefire, and unimpeded humanitarian access;\n• Donate to organisations supporting educators in conflict zones;\n• Provide cash assistance directly to families (for example, through instant/Express transfers, or whenever possible, bank transfers to family members you know there, or through trusted aid organisations);\n• Offer financial support to community kitchens in Gaza;\n• Support UNRWA’s vital services in Gaza, including aid, as well as health, education and other development programmes, and advocate for the lifting of the Israeli ban on its operations in the Occupied Palestinian Territories; and\n• Document the impact of starvation on educators through unions and human rights groups, as well as through academic writings and oral history interviews with those who survive it.\nLong-term solutions :\n• Strengthen international legal protection for civilians (including educators), and for aid and humanitarian workers;\n• Enforce water security in the Occupied Palestinian Territories;\n• Fundraise to rebuild higher education, including infrastructure that is accessible;\n• Offer psychological support and livelihood programmes;\n• Promote digital learning and offer remote work opportunities for Gaza;\n• Support agricultural education and survival skills as part of the curriculum;\n• Provide low-tech solutions for communities to use in times of emergency (for instance, solar cookers to reduce dependency on fuel);\n• Support the digital archiving of Palestinian academic and cultural heritage; and\n• Strengthen local community resilience in post-war reconstruction (for example, by revitalising farming capacity and promoting resource regeneration by restoring water wells, building solar energy infrastructure, rehabilitating damaged soil and ecosystems and by other means).\nThese interventions are not only relevant to Gaza but to all conflict-affected regions where education is under siege.\nBeyond the devastating personal toll, starvation in Gaza jeopardises the future of higher education, academic values and the right to learn and teach in dignity. What is at stake are the values we claim to uphold – justice, equity, human rights and the integrity of knowledge.\nThe global higher education community must speak out, stand in solidarity and take action to ensure that educators in Gaza – and anywhere facing such atrocities – are not left to starve in silence.\nDr Mona Jebril is a research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Business Research and a bye-fellow in education and academic development at Queens’ College, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.

In addition, future visa applications from China would face stricter scrutiny, he said.\nRubio’s statement was reposted the next day on the US Embassy in China’s webpage, which was instantly flooded with angry responses from Chinese netizens.\n“This isn’t self-defence; it’s self-harm,” read one highly upvoted comment.\nThe move, seen as part of a broader crackdown on foreign students in the US, followed a 27 April State Department directive instructing US embassies and consulates worldwide to pause student visa interview appointments.\nDisruption warnings\nIn reaction, Chinese education agents warned of short-term disruptions. Zhang Chunfei, a study abroad consultant from New Channel, a leading study abroad services provider in China, said the flurry of recent US policy shifts has sparked growing concern among Chinese families.\n“Due to the frequent policy changes, many students and parents have come to consult us, and parents are generally worried about the impact of policy uncertainty on their children's studies in the United States,” he told University World News.\n“Students who have completed visa appointments are basically unaffected, but students who have not yet made appointments may face delays, especially those who plan to enrol this fall. If they cannot successfully obtain visas before the start of school, they may need to consider delaying enrolment or taking alternatives such as online courses,” he noted.\nAccording to official data from the US-based Institute of International Education, in 2024, an estimated 280,000 Chinese students were studying in the US. However, it remains unclear how many may be impacted by the new restrictions.\nHoping for policy adjustments\nZhang, who focuses on admissions for US undergraduate programmes, added that agencies like his were watching closely to see whether US universities might pressure the government for policy adjustments.\nBut for now, prospective students were being advised to explore other study destinations. The UK, Australia, and Singapore are seen as favourite choices, offering not only a world-class education but also more “stable and predictable” visa regimes, according to Zhang.\nThis echoes recent advice from the Beijing Overseas Study Service Association (BOSSA), China’s biggest industry association of study abroad service agencies, which recently told its 300-strong members to diversify beyond the United States and steer prospective students towards alternative regions.\n“More investment can be directed toward ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations], the Middle East, and other areas involved in the Belt and Road Initiative,” said BOSSA’s president Sang Mingze.\nFor Chinese students already in the US, once they are notified their visas have been revoked, they should immediately contact their university’s international student office, said Zhang. “Most US institutions have experience dealing with these cases and can intervene quickly,” he noted.\nCarl Zeng, director of Beijing-based study abroad consultancy Lead the Future, stressed current students should remain in the US, where they would be in a better position to access legal assistance when hit with visa cancellations.\n“But if they were to come back [to China], there is a possibility that they will never be able to return [to the US],” he said.\nPlans in the air\nFor many students, the announcement has already put their plans in limbo. In particular, students set to begin their studies this fall semester face uncertainty over whether they can secure visas in time.\nAlina Chen from southern Fujian province was accepted into the University of Washington’s Master of Communication in Digital Media programme.\nAfter her F-1 visa application was rejected at the US consulate in Shanghai on 29 May, she said she planned to reapply – only to find that all new applications had been suspended, leaving her feeling “a long way off” from the United States.\nDelaying was not possible for her, as the University of Washington does not allow students to enrol at a later date. “I don’t know if they will change their mind given the latest policy,” she said.\n“I originally had a detailed and clear plan, but now I’m confused,” she told University World News.\nChen’s experience is far from unique. Posting on the popular Chinese social media platform Rednote, thousands of students said they were seeking alternative plans.\n“I felt this [news] would [make things] quite risky, so I plan on entering into the US early via the language programme in early June,” wrote a PhD candidate residing in Sichuan, referring to short-term courses offered at some universities during the summer.\nAnother undergraduate student admitted to Rutgers University commented, “At worst, I’ll just hope for a delayed enrolment.”\nConcern about sensitive subjects\nIn his 28 April statement, Rubio also identified students “in critical fields” as a key target of the new visa policies.\nAlthough this category was not clearly defined, students in areas deemed sensitive, such as aerospace, semiconductors, and AI, are already starting to look elsewhere, according to Zhang, due to heightened scrutiny and lengthy administrative reviews.\n“When preparing visa materials, attention should be paid to compliance in application materials, such as scientific research experience and internship background. This should be clear and standardised to avoid being misunderstood as sensitive content,” he stated.\nStill, there is some cautious optimism, as Zhang believes the current freeze may be temporary, citing strong support from US universities for international students and their reliance on global talent.\nIn the long run, however, Zhang noted US visas for sensitive majors in STEM fields will remain under strict review. “We believe that the door to studying in the United States remains open, but prudent preparation and a diversified strategy have become the new normal,” he said.\n“Although the overall educational quality of American universities is still attractive, the uncertainty of visa policies is indeed weakening the confidence of some students and parents. Whether the US policy is clear and predictable will greatly affect the willingness of Chinese students to go to the United States in the next few years,” Zhang said.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

My approach is this: when there is a threat, there is always an opportunity. We have to look at the other side of the coin,” Hamidi was quoted by Malaysian national news agency Bernama as saying.\nStudents currently in the US\nMARA is also studying the impact of current US policies on its students already there, Dusuki said. “We will make a decision on them once the study is completed,” he said, noting that it was important not to “demotivate” students already in the US.\nIn 2024 MARA sent a total of 4,577 Malaysian students abroad, with such scholarships accounting for RM706 million (US$166 million) out of an annual budget of RM2 billion for undergraduates, masters, PhDs and students pursuing professional qualifications abroad.\nWhile Malaysian students study in around 24 countries, the largest number is in the UK, which hosts 1,508 MARA-sponsored students.\nThe MARA announcement this week reverses an initiative announced just last year to send more outstanding Malaysian students to Ivy League universities in the US, including Harvard.\n“Our focus is to ensure more Malay students can attend Ivy League universities,” Dusuki also said in February, pointing at the time to special projects designed for students to gain entry to US Ivy League universities.\nBut at the same time MARA was also looking to send students, such as medical students, to cheaper countries due to rising tuition fee levels.\nUK universities offer tuition fee discounts\nMARA has negotiated tuition fee discounts of 10-20% with three UK universities, according to Dusuki, with Warwick University and Birmingham University offering 20% off fees and the University of Edinburgh 10% off.\n“Following negotiations with Warwick University, Birmingham University and Edinburgh University, all three have agreed to provide discounts of 10 to 20% for MARA students,” he said in a Facebook post this week.\n“To illustrate, Warwick University is offering a discount of up to £6,000 (US$8,100) a year. For a typical three-year undergraduate programme, that amounts to £18,000, around RM110,000 in total, significantly reducing the cost,” he stated.\nThe University of Birmingham declined to comment, citing “commercial sensitivities”. The University of Warwick also declined to comment.\nOne UK-based university source, not authorised to speak to the media, cast doubt on the size of the discounts announced and suggested agreements had not yet been finalised with universities in the UK.\nDusuki, in a social media post on 4 June, said many universities, including some in the UK, had contacted him to offer discounts of “up to 25%” on MARA students’ tuition fees. He noted after a visit to University College London: “The vice-president himself expressed readiness to offer MARA discounts.”\nThe British Council’s director in Malaysia, Jazreel Goh, told University World News via email: “Students as well as funders are looking for value for money and to stretch their investments further. These gestures [discounts] offered by UK universities would be very welcomed and appreciated by MARA.\n“The UK is very important, as we are a long-term and valued partner to Malaysia. In addition, our universities have a track record of working with MARA.”\nPointing to broader trends relating to Malaysian students going abroad, Goh, who is also East Asia Insights and Engagement Hub lead at the British Council, said: “In recent years, the number of Malaysian higher education students enrolled in the UK has actually been on the rebound, with the number of students in 2023 to 2024 being 8.6% higher than in 2020 to 2021.\n“In comparison, the number of students enrolled in the US and Australia are still about 12-15% lower than in 2020 to 2021, with the number of students enrolled in the US on a consistent decline.”\nShe added: “We expect the UK to continue to be the preferred study destination of choice for many Malaysians.”\nGoh also pointed to the 10,000 Malaysian students who were in China before the COVID-19 pandemic. There were an estimated 2,200 Malaysian students, including MARA students, in Japan and 4,800 in South Korea in 2022. “Those numbers have likely increased as well,” she said.\n“The number of Malaysian students in the UK, however, still remains significant at over 12,000; we would still place the UK as the top study destination for Malaysian students, though the competition [from other destination countries] is definitely more intense now than before,” she added.\nIndonesia looking for alternatives\nMeanwhile, the Indonesian government has also said it is exploring study opportunities at top universities outside the US for the country’s own students on government scholarships.\nIndonesia’s Higher Education, Science, and Technology Minister Brian Yuliarto said the government is committed to ensuring that Indonesian students can continue their education in the US without disruption.\n“We are initiating discussions with top universities in other countries to assess the feasibility of transferring students’ academic programmes,” Yuliarto said in an official statement on 29 May.\nAn Indonesian foreign ministry spokesperson said there are 87 Indonesian students currently at Harvard.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

It supports 24 calls for proposals in five strategic areas – public health, green transition, innovation and technology, capacities for science, and cross-cutting priorities.\nThese calls are aimed at advancing shared priorities between the African Union (AU) and the EU, and many explicitly require or encourage African participation alongside European partners, opening up new opportunities for universities, R&I institutions, and consortia of researchers across Africa.\nThe initiative was launched as part of Horizon Europe’s 2025 Work Programme, which outlines annual R&I priorities, including funding to address global challenges in health, climate, digital transformation, and international cooperation.\n25 years of AU-EU partnership\nThough it signals “a major intensification of cooperation”, the third wave of support to Africa under Horizon Europe “doesn’t come out of the blue”, according to Dr Laurent Bochereau, the minister-counsellor for science, technology and innovation at the EU Delegation to the AU.\nIt comes as the two continents mark 25 years of formal partnership and 15 years of science and innovation cooperation.\nKey milestones include:\n•\t2000: Africa-EU Partnership launched at first summit in Cairo;\n•\t2007: Joint Africa-EU Strategy (JAES) adopted in Lisbon;\n•\t2007-13: The EU’s 7th Framework Programme (FP7) includes early R&I cooperation with Africa;\n•\t2010: High-Level Policy Dialogue (HLPD) on STI established;\n•\t2013: AU adopts Agenda 2063, its 50-year strategic framework for inclusive and sustainable development;\n•\t2014: AU approves an STI Strategy for Africa; (STISA-2024);\n•\t2014-20: The EU’s Horizon 2020 framework funds R&I cooperation with Africa, though without dedicated work packages;\n•\t2017: Establishment of the Partnership on Food and Nutrition Security and Sustainable Agriculture (FNSSA);\n•\t2021: EU launches Global Gateway, a €300 billion plan (by 2027) to fund sustainable infrastructure worldwide, with the focus in Africa on the digital, energy, transport, health and education sectors;\n•\t2021: Horizon Europe succeeds Horizon 2020 as the EU’s main R&I funding programme (€95.5 billion, 2021-27);\n•\t2021-22: Horizon Europe’s Africa Initiative I provides €128 million in funding to 473 African organisations in more than 40 countries as part of 36 calls totalling €350 million;\n•\t2022: Joint Vision for 2030 adopted at the Sixth EU-AU Summit in Brussels – a strategic framework to guide cooperation between the two continents across shared priorities;\n•\t2023-24: Africa Initiative II consolidates Horizon Europe engagement (€300 million);\n•\t2023: AU-EU Innovation Agenda adopted, prioritising public health, green transition, innovation and technology, capacities for science, and cross-cutting issues;\n•\t2024: AU designates 2025-34 the Decade of Accelerated Education and Skills Development in Africa;\n•\tFebruary 2025: AU adopts STISA-2034, the updated 10-year continental strategy for science, technology and innovation; and\n•\t15 May 2025: Horizon Europe’s Africa Initiative III launched (€500.5 million).\n“Over the past decades, we have achieved impressive results by cooperating in diverse areas of R&I,” Nienke Buisman of the EC’s policy department for R&I, said in a recorded message played during a webinar on 28 May.\nTitled 'Horizon Europe's Africa Initiative III – Focus on South Africa' the webinar session focused on South Africa, but the initiative itself is Pan African in scope, and it is being rolled out across the continent, with outreach activities and information sessions held in multiple countries.\nDeepening Africa-Europe research ties\nOfficials on both continents say the Africa Initiative III signals more than a funding boost. It reflects the maturing of Africa-Europe research ties, a shift towards strategic partnerships grounded in mutual benefit, and a growing role for science diplomacy in tackling shared global challenges.\nSpeaking during the webinar, Tokozile Xasa, South Africa’s ambassador to the EU, said the “Africa Initiative III is not just a funding programme, but an opportunity to strengthen R&I ecosystems, support innovation-led sustainable development, and deliver shared solutions to the challenges we face.”\nDr Vincenzo Lorusso, the EC’s policy officer for STI cooperation with Africa, added: “Africa is our strategic partner in R&I. This initiative reflects a strong political commitment to co-developing and co-owning solutions, with African institutions in the lead or in truly equitable partnerships.”\nOpportunities for Africa\n“These calls are designed to involve African institutions and researchers, ensuring meaningful participation in consortia tackling shared challenges in areas such as climate change adaptation, clean energy, sustainable agriculture, digital innovation, science for policy, and equitable access to health,” the EU said in a media release.\nFunding is available, not only to senior researchers, but also to early-career scientists, historically disadvantaged institutions and innovation hubs. Many calls support interdisciplinary approaches and require consortia that span multiple countries and sectors, creating space for African leadership and agenda-setting.\n“We’re not only encouraging Africa-Europe collaboration,” Lorusso said. “Horizon Europe is also a tool to foster intra-African scientific cooperation – through joint participation in project consortia, by leveraging existing and supporting new regional networks, and through a deliberate effort to widen participation across the continent, including historically underrepresented institutions and countries.”\nResearch collaboration in a shifting world\nThe Horizon Europe funding arrives at a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty and funding cutbacks in traditional science powers. The US, UK, Germany and the Netherlands have all signalled reductions in higher education and international science funding.\nAgainst this backdrop, the EU’s model of science diplomacy – offering long-term collaboration rooted in reciprocity – has become a powerful form of ‘soft power’.\nThis echoes the EU’s recent European Framework for Science Diplomacy, which encourages strategic global collaboration through R&I.\nAfrican officials and scientists say this is welcomed – but they are also clear that partnerships must be equitable. As Xasa put it, in fostering “partnerships that can address our shared global challenges,” the continent’s focus is on “Africa-led R&I” and “the participation of African institutions and researchers”.\nFive strategic areas\nWith 24 call topics now open under Africa Initiative III, consortia are already forming. National contact points, science ministries and university research offices are mobilising to match researchers with calls, provide technical guidance and ensure that deadlines are met.\nThe Africa Initiative III spans five strategic areas:\n1. Public Health (€50 million): The development of antibodies and antibody-derived proteins for the prevention and treatment of infectious diseases with epidemic potential;\n2. Green Transition (€241 million): Climate change and sustainable energy; food and nutrition security; sustainable agriculture; water security and biodiversity;\n3. Innovation and Technology (€186.5 million): Disaster preparedness technologies; critical raw materials; industrial partnerships; semiconductor value chains; generative AI for Africa;\n4. Capacities for Science (€3.5 million): Bridging historical past and future potential through conservation, preservation and adaptive use of Europe’s contentious and dissonant heritage; and\n5. Cross-cutting Issues (€19.5 million): Migration and climate change; disaster risk management; open strategic autonomy, economic and research security in EU foreign policy.\nThese five strategic areas overlap to some extent with the six thematic clusters under Pillar II of Horizon Europe: health; culture, creativity and inclusive society; civil security for society; digital, industry and space; climate, energy and mobility; and food, bioeconomy, natural resources, agriculture and environment.\nWho can apply?\nAfrican and European universities, research institutions, NGOs, innovation hubs, and private sector actors can apply.\nCollaborative consortia typically involving multiple researchers and-or institutions from different eligible countries are also eligible. Most calls under the Africa Initiative III favour cross-border and cross-sectoral collaboration. While eligibility varies per topic, applicants are generally encouraged to form diverse consortia that include institutions from both Europe and Africa.\n“Success doesn’t depend on nationality,” Lorusso said. “It depends on alignment with the call, a strong cross-sectoral approach, and clear policy relevance. Proposals must also integrate social sciences, gender equity, and evidence of use for policymaking – missing these is a frequent reason for rejection.”\nApplicants are advised to consult the specific call texts available on the EU Funding and Tenders Portal to ensure compliance and competitiveness.\nCalls opened on 14 May 2025 and deadlines are set for between September and December 2025.\nSupport and outreach\nEfforts to promote the Africa Initiative III are continent-wide, and include support by EURAXESS Africa, a European Commission platform offering free access to information about job opportunities, funding schemes, hosting offers and mobility tools for African researchers.\n“We help you find the right calls, the right partners, and the right moment to apply,” says the platform’s Dr Yedilfana Setarge Mekonnen. “We aim to close the information gap – to ensure African researchers have the same timely access to funding opportunities as their European counterparts.”\nOn 21 and 22 May 2025, two high-level online information sessions – the first in French, the second in English – drew nearly 2,000 participants from across Africa.\nFurther outreach is planned, including a webinar to be co-hosted with Cabo Verde’s Ministry of Higher Education on 10 June, and a hands-on workshop in Kigali on 19 June focused on proposal development and mobility opportunities.\nTwo events are planned for 26 June – a dedicated hybrid session to support engagement by researchers and institutions in Nigeria, and an online seminar co-hosted with the University of Seychelles, offering practical guidance for researchers, academics and innovation stakeholders.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Between 2021 and 2024, Biden increased the grant from US$6,495 to US$7,395 – and had plans to increase it to US$8,145 if he won the 2024 election.\nBy contrast, and in contradistinction to the first Trump administration, during which there were modest increases in the Pell Grants, including through the 2019 FUTURE Act, which also increased funding for historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), the OBBB would cut the grant by US$1,685 to US$5,710 – US$788 less than it was in 2021.\n“Even during politically polarising times, the federal Pell Grant programme has historically seen broad bipartisan support,” said Melanie Storey, president and CEO of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, in a statement posted on the association’s website.\n“Significantly reducing the maximum Pell Grant – an award targeted to low-income students – while cutting or eliminating complementary programmes reverses decades of commitment to the promise of the Higher Education Act and would result in considerable harm for students pursuing postsecondary education,” she noted.\nReduced eligibility\nIn addition to reducing the grants made to students, the OBBB will save money by drastically reducing eligibility.\nCurrently, both full-time and part-time students are eligible. A full-time student is defined as a student taking 12 credits (normally three courses) per semester, for 24 credits per year. A part-time student normally would take six credits per semester for 12 credits per year.\n“They would make that 15 and 30 [for a full-time student],” Jon Fansmith, assistant vice-president of government relations for the American Council on Education (ACE), told a media briefing on 4 June. “That would also mean that the halftime level goes up because of the higher [full-time] threshold.\nThis change would eliminate the eligibility for all students studying less than half-time (as newly defined), which is one out of every 10 – or 700,000 – students, Fansmith explained.\nAccording to Fansmith, this change targets two groups. The first, and smaller, is the part-time population of residential four-year colleges.\nThe second and much larger group is enrolled in open-access community colleges, most of which offer two-year degrees that allow entry into the third year of four-year programmes in that state’s state university system and, thus, are escalators for poor students into the higher education system.\nMore than two-thirds of the nation’s almost seven million community college students are part-time. And of these, 1.3 million received Pell Grants for the current academic year.\n“These students are disproportionately working adults, disproportionately student parents. These are a population that ostensibly could get more aid if they took more courses, but realistically they don’t have the resources, the time, the money and the ability to juggle family life and work obligations to take more courses,” said Fansmith.\nWhile white Americans account for 58% of the American population, and blacks account for 13.7% and Hispanics account for 19.5%, in community colleges, the number of black and Hispanic students is almost equal to white students.\nSome 1.7 million community college students are white, and some 1.6 million students are either black or Hispanic, who, on the whole, are much poorer than are white students.\nAccordingly, the cuts envisaged by the OBBB will fall most heavily on black and Hispanic students.\nScrapping of loans\nOther measures in Trump's bill will also negatively affect low-income students.\nIf it becomes law, the Stafford Loan Program (SLP) will be eliminated. Under the SLP, established six decades ago, the federal government pays the interest on loans taken out by low-income students.\n“I was actually shocked when we ran the analysis,” said Fansmith.\n“That works out, on average, to costing those students over US$6,000 in terms of what their borrowing costs would be. Six thousand dollars more than low-income students will have to pay and not see any benefit whatsoever. They are borrowing the same amount; they’re just paying more to do it.”\nOther programmes that will be eliminated include the ParentPlus Loans, which allow a parent of a dependent child who is enrolled in a college or university to take out a government loan to help pay for their child’s education expenses not covered by other grants or loans.\nAlso targeted for elimination is the GradPlus Loan programme that is available to graduate or professional students.\nThe OBBB will also eliminate programmes that provide childcare for students on campus, further hampering the ability of low-income students to attend college or university.\nThe budget set aside for work study will be slashed by almost US$1billion: from US$1.2 billion to US$250 million.\nAs Fansmith explained, “The reason it’s being cut so low is because they [the government] would switch from the government providing 75% of the funding and employers 25% to employers providing 75% and the government providing 25%.”\nThere are no government documents available that indicate whether work study employers will continue to participate in the programme as it is reworked by the OBBB.\nCuts to outreach programmes\nOn 3 June, when she appeared before the Senate Appropriations Committee – four days after the TRIO programmes were given two days’ notice to shut down – Secretary of Education Linda McMahon defended the proposal to eliminate almost all of the US$1.2 billion budget of the TRIO programmes, a suite of eight outreach programmes designed to help students from disadvantaged backgrounds enter and succeed in college.\nThe cutting of TRIO (and the Job Corps programme, which was also given two days to wind up) is not part of the OBBB but, rather, money cut from this year’s budget, that is, money Congress authorised but the administration refused to spend. (It is, therefore, similar to the billions of dollars cut from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and USAID.)\nThe administration’s goal, she said, is “to make education better, fairer and more accountable by ending federal overreach and empowering families, schools and states who best know the needs of their students.”\nSpeaking of the TRIO programmes specifically, McMahon said: “While I absolutely agree that there is some effectiveness of these programmes, in many circumstances, these programmes were negotiated at very tough terms in that the Department of Education has no ability to go in and look at the accountability of the TRIO programmes. It specifically eliminates our ability to do that.”\nSenator Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, who co-chairs the Congressional TRIO Caucus, said at the subcommittee hearing she strongly disagreed with the proposed TRIO cuts.\n“From my experience in Maine, I have seen the lives of countless first-generation and low-income students, not only in Maine but across the country, who will often face barriers to accessing a college education, changed by the TRIO programme,” she stated.\nInternational students\nThe ACE briefing also discussed the chaos international students are facing. At this point, the pause in new interviews for visas that Secretary of State Marco Rubio put in place two weeks ago remains, though ACE believes that the renewal of visas is proceeding, albeit slowly.\nAccording to Sara Spreitzer, ACE vice-president and chief of staff for government relations, ACE is particularly concerned about the leaked policy which indicated that the State Department would start vetting social media accounts of applicants to Harvard.\n“Under that policy, it looked like whether or not there were things posted on social media that didn’t align with US policy, an applicant would be in jeopardy.\n“Most concerning was they said that lack of a social media profile would indicate concern. So, you couldn’t just go in and delete your social media accounts because they [the government] would take that almost as admitting that you had something to hide,” said Spreitzer.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

What institutions can do to safeguard academic freedom was the focus of a recent roundtable in Lebanon.\n“Since the attacks on higher education over the last couple of years, especially since 7 October 2023 [the Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent start of the Gaza war], we’ve seen a global crisis around academic freedom.\n“We need to explore strategies and discuss experiences to protect researchers, as well as foster collaboration and strengthen networks,” said Joanne Boustany, research coordinator on safeguarding knowledge in the Arab region, at the Beirut, Lebanon-based Arab Council for the Social Sciences (ACSS).\nSpeaking at the ACSS roundtable “Safeguarding Academic Freedom: What Should Institutions Do?” as part of the ACSS conference “Devastation, Imaginaries and Knowledge: Regional Junctures and Global Repercussions” in Beirut, Boustany said the state of academic freedom varies across the region and has been in flux since the so-called Arab Spring in 2011, when pro-democracy protests in the Middle East and North Africa challenged several regional authoritarian regimes.\nThe changing political context – marked by regime changes, such as in Egypt in 2011 (the fall of Hosni Mubarak), in Tunisia in 2011 (the fall of Ben Ali), and the collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria in 2024 – and crackdowns by authoritarian regimes has affected academic freedom.\nMeanwhile, in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, research into local political topics is considered taboo, but scientific research areas may be more open than in countries such as Lebanon, for instance, Boustany noted.\nNo safe space in diaspora\n“The turning point in academic freedom in the region was 2011. In Lebanon, there have not been big breaches in academic freedom, like in Jordan (where intelligence services monitor campus life, and scholarly material is scrutinised for politically sensitive content), Egypt and Syria, but since the war on Gaza, it is a global crisis. Academics in the [Arab] diaspora thought they had a safe space, but they've found they are not protected,” Boustany told University World News.\nShe said that some of the participants invited to the conference were unable to get visas to attend or were turned away at the Lebanese border, with Lebanese authorities denying them entry for unexplained reasons. Palestinian academics were also prevented from leaving by Israeli authorities, she added.\n“The issue of visa denial is a direct violation of academic freedom. And the same thing happens for Arab scholars who want to go to the West for conferences at prestigious universities,” she said.\nDealing with censorship\nAccording to ACSS researcher and project coordinator Reem Joudi, the collapse of higher education over the past decade in Yemen due to conflict “has made all topics sensitive”, while in Lebanon, since the civil war ended in 1990, research into corruption has been considered a particularly sensitive topic.\nPublishing under pseudonyms is a commonly used tactic to overcome censorship and silencing in more repressive environments. Carrying out field research has, however, been complicated by conflict and crises, while dissemination of research has also been a challenge, as it could put researchers and associates at risk with the authorities, said Joudi.\n“Language is a further issue, as publishing in Arabic is a big challenge and may open up access to the authorities, who can critique it, so research may be published in English instead, on social media platforms,” said Joudi. Such output limits readership to English speakers, curbing knowledge dissemination to the 373 million people in 22 countries who speak Arabic.\nThe clampdown on free speech and academic freedom in the United States and certain European countries, such as Germany, following Israel’s wars in the Palestinian Occupied Territories and Lebanon since 2023, has had a particularly widespread impact on researchers, said roundtable participants.\nIsrael attacked Lebanon after the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah joined the Gazan conflict in solidarity with the Palestinians.\n“I used to think that academic freedom was an issue related to us in the Arab region, but since October 7, we have a common difficulty with Europe and the US,” said Abaher El-Sakka, associate professor and dean of the Faculty of Arts at the Ramallah, Palestine-based Birzeit University.\nWhile local researchers are aware of country-specific taboo topics and have learnt how to navigate the political landscape by, for example, publishing anonymously, self-censorship has been increasing. It has been facilitated by donor pressure on universities and the harassment of researchers and deportation of academics from the United States over the past year.\n“We do self-censor, and in many places, we have faced double criticism because the power of knowledge production has been established in the Global North, and on the other side, regional academia is dependent on donor money and international visibility,” said El-Sakka.\nRepercussions\nSome academics, who spoke to University World News anonymously for fear of repercussions, said they faced repercussions in the region and in North America for denouncing the war in Gaza and associated research on Palestinians.\nThis has included fallout for attendance at the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of the Lebanese political party Hezbollah, killed by an Israeli air strike in Beirut in September 2024.\nOne academic said their departmental post was not renewed at a leading private Lebanese university after they posted on social media that they attended the funeral, held in February 2025 in Beirut.\nThe same source said no official reason was given for the non-renewal, but the source said they believed that external pressure had been applied to the university not to allow academics to attend Nasrallah’s funeral, adding that it was their right to attend for research purposes.\nHezbollah is a designated terrorist group in the United States and the United Kingdom, but its political wing is part of the Lebanese government.\nCuts to funding and donor interference in research and appointments of staff are considered some of the major threats to academic freedom in the Arab region. Cuts to foreign aid and academic institutions this year by US President Donald Trump’s administration have added to the pressure.\n“Funding priorities shape research agendas. Western donors may interfere in an institution's outputs, especially when they directly challenge Western power structures. It is important to think of the trade-offs – when to compromise or when to stand your ground. Negotiating with donors is a skill to master,” said Joudi.\nKnowledge as a public good\nNadim Houry, executive director of the Beirut-based Arab Reform Initiative, suggested institutions should create independent budgets to carry out research and knowledge generation on the topics that donors are unwilling to fund.\nFor research institutions to grow around the region and carry on amid funding struggles, funding needs to be diversified, he said.\n“That is easier said than done. It takes 70% of my time and involves certain trade-offs. If you want to grow fast as an institution, don't depend on half of your funding from one donor.\n“Developing robust institutions also means having regular, maybe uncomfortable, conversations with the board and staff. Are we willing to fight and die for these issues if I make a particular stand with a donor?” asked Houry.\nHoury also suggested that institutions adopt multiple legal structures to safeguard knowledge and adjust strategies to respond to varying political pressures.\n“We are registered in Lebanon and France, so when we lost access to bank accounts in Lebanon [due to the country's crippling financial crisis in 2019], we moved to France,” Houry said. “If you are only registered in the US and only work on Palestine, register somewhere else tomorrow. Safeguarding also means thinking about legal risk.”\nEnhancing support for knowledge production in the region requires that it be conceived as a public good, a conception that institutions will have to develop in order to have an impact.\n“The challenge is: Who are you producing knowledge for? A big frustration is gaining access to read an academic paper behind a paywall that costs more than a person's monthly wage.\n“The same applies to us as research institutions. If it mainly goes into the drawers of corrupt politicians or the United Nations never publishes research, why would society want to protect us? Is knowledge public to begin with? Is it accessible?” asked Houry.\nHoury said that safeguarding knowledge and its production should also be considered beyond academia. “Is academic freedom more important than other freedoms? Of course, we should organise and have coalitions for academic freedom, but what solidarity are we showing to other knowledge producers – journalists, bloggers, research institutions – if we don't stand with them, as well?”\nSupport for academics\nACSS research on silencing and censorship in knowledge production in the Arab region has found that educational institutions “did not have clear policies [and are instead] focused on risk mitigation, telling researchers to focus on no-harm principles on a case-by-case basis,” said Joudi.\nThe ACSS has been carrying out research on academic freedom through closed discussions and encouraging academics to anonymously submit reflection pieces and air their concerns. The centre aims to develop toolkits and launch an anonymous blog.\nA regional coalition under ACSS on academic freedom is also being planned, including Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Sudan and Algeria, according to Boustany. She said that closed discussions on academic freedom were “usually angrier” than the Beirut roundtable, with anonymity providing more room for open discussion.\nKasper Landmark, a programme advisor at the Norwegian Students’ and Academics’ International Assistance Fund (SAIH), gave an overview of the fund and how it operates.\nCore funding comes from 180,000 students who pay an annual fee of US$3-US$4, in addition to governmental grants and international partnerships. This has enabled SAIH to provide support to student activists who face repression around the world.\nHe said while the most visible form of repression is carried out by the state, for instance, through the actions of riot police, in many countries the biggest barriers to academic freedom occur in the institutions, with students expelled or having grades withheld.\n“It is not just the targeting of activist leaders or students that causes a chilling effect, as students are afraid of [politically] engaging due to the consequences,” he noted.\nActivist students “may spend a night or day in prison, but if they are expelled or lose scholarships, or their parents back out, that really hurts,” he said.\nLandmark said that SAIH was part of the United Nations’ Working Group on Academic Freedom (WGAF), which developed the report, Principles for Implementing the Right to Academic Freedom, released in 2024.\nHe argued it “could be a useful tool for the region as it clarifies what institutions can do beyond vague commitments to freedom and accountability mechanisms. Furthermore, it could also provide “some practical guidance on particular threats and offers a benchmark for universities to use”.\nThe document suggests, for instance, the establishment of offices or committees that are empowered to raise academic freedom issues proactively, such as an academic freedom ombudsperson or ambassador.\nIt also advocates guaranteeing the security of people and institutions while refraining from forms of militarisation and surveillance as these undermine academic freedom and autonomy.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

And since working with firearms also required a licence, the involvement of a local shooting association was suggested as well.\nSolutions for a changing world\nThe notion was discussed at the department board level, with the student representatives coming out against it.\nTogether with fellow students from Europa-Universität Flensburg, students launched the “Campus ohne Wehrtechnik” (campus without defence technology) to draw attention to their cause, arguing that the new measure would harm the university’s image and warning against putting research and teaching at the service of military interests.\n“We’re living in times in which right-wing forces are getting stronger and stronger and socio-ecological crises are on the rise,” said spokesperson for the initiative Clara Tempel.\n“Now, in particular, we shouldn’t be entering collaborative ventures with arms companies at universities. Instead, we ought to be developing forward-looking solutions for a changing world,” she noted. The new scheme was rejected by a clear majority at a further meeting of the board.\nNational context\nIn two of Germany’s 16 federal states, Bremen and Thuringia, civil clauses at universities have been given legal status. These clauses are commitments by the universities to focus on non-military research and teaching.\nTwelve further states leave a decision on whether military research should be conducted up to the universities themselves. In one of these states, Hesse, legislation addressing civil clauses is under review.\nFour states, including Brandenburg, whose regulations are said to clash with existing law, recommend research for solely peaceful purposes. In Bavaria, on the other hand, a law supporting the Federal Army obliges institutions to conduct military research “should the need arise”.\nAnd in cases of such a need arising, in line with Social Democrat Minister of Defence Boris Pistorius’ insistence in 2024 that the country be “made fit for war”, the Federal Ministry of Defence points out that civil clauses “can constitute a hindrance both to collaboration with universities and to researchers seeking to make their contribution to the defence effort of society as a whole”.\nPistorius himself has called for more cooperation between universities and the Federal Army.\nBan on civil clauses\nBavaria’s Minister-President Markus Söder, whose Christian Social Union is part of the new federal government, together with the Christian Democrats and the Social Democrats, would like to see the ban on civil clauses Bavaria introduced with its legislation on supporting the Federal Army in August 2024 imposed throughout Germany, as he already indicated in a “master plan” he presented for Germany’s armed forces at the Munich Security Conference last February.\nThe arms sector plays a prominent role in Germany’s economy, which is facing bleak prospects in many other areas. Next to the United States, Germany is the second largest arms supplier both to Ukraine and to Israel.\nChristian Democrat Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs Johann Wadephul’s announcement that Germany backed US President Donald Trump’s calls for more spending on defence among NATO countries saw a swift rise in shareholder value among the arms sector. Bavaria’s Hensoldt, just one of its several leading arms companies, topped gains at 6%.\nContact Michael Gardner at michael.gardner@uw-news.com\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The true impact of the grants is still a matter of debate.\nThe report produced by PLINT, the Platform for Internationalisation, earlier this spring, is titled How can we make it easier for exceptionally qualified tuition-fee-paying international students to study in Sweden?\nIt analyses data on grants given to tuition-fee-paying international students between 2013 and 2024 to develop a clear overview of the grants that have been awarded over the period.\nFigures show that 6,777 of the total grants of 10,615 were administered by the Swedish Council for Higher Education (UHR) under its Stipendieprogrammet för avgiftsskyldiga studenter (Grant programme for tuition-fee-paying students), which fully or partially covered tuition fees for students.\nA total of 3,838 comprised scholarships for global professionals administered by the Swedish Institute (SI), and these included tuition fee support and grants to cover living costs and travels.\nAccording to the report, the two grant programmes were introduced in response to concerns that the introduction of tuition fees in 2011 for students from outside the European Union (EU)-European Economic Area (EEA) would mean students from these areas, particularly those from low- and medium-income countries, would no longer be able to study in Sweden.\nSuch students had been studying in Sweden to contribute to development both in Sweden and in their home countries.\nThe UHR grant programme was intended to increase the attractiveness of Sweden as a study destination for “exceptionally qualified” tuition-fee-paying students.\nThe grant is distributed to higher education institutions, which in turn allocate the grant to reduce, either fully or in part, tuition fees for selected students at the institution for between one to six terms.\nPLINT worked with consultant company Ramboll to analyse the data.\n“We have focused upon systematising the information we already have to create a better picture of the impact of the programmes,” said Magnus Hallbåter, who coordinates the work of PLINT at UHR.\n“This can be of support for the respective authorities in their further development of the programmes. If there is a need, the material can also be useful in further evaluations; in that case, in coordination with the higher education institutions,” he noted.\nHallbåter said the collaboration between UHR and SI has contributed to a better understanding of “how we are handling the two programmes after the introduction of the tuition fees”.\nSweden as a study destination\nThe report indicates that the UHR grant programme for tuition-fee-paying students awarded 6,777 grants with a total value of SEK723 million (US$77.2 million) over the period under review.\nAccording to the data, the average allocation has been SEK181,018 (US$17,300). The value of the grant has been reduced over time in order to make more grants available. In 2022, more women than men received a grant, breaking an overall trend which saw 56% of the grants going to men.\nFigures show that over the 11-year period, grants were awarded to students from 104 countries. Fifty-three per cent of the total grants were given to students from China (19%), India (16%), Pakistan (8%), Iran (5%) and the United States (5%) – SEK430 million to a total of 3,868 grant holders. Over time, the number of grants to students in some countries in Africa increased.\nThe largest sending countries were India (1,399 individuals), China (1,220), Pakistan (602), Iran (372), Bangladesh (281), the United States (275) and Nigeria (274).\nThe grants were awarded to students at 36 higher education institutions. Lund University received SEK86 million for 539 grantees, KTH-Stockholm SEK 86 million for 610 students and Uppsala University SEK61 million for 354 students. These three universities received 32% of the budget.\nScholarships for Global Professionals\nAccording to the report, total funding for 3,838 grants under the Scholarships for Global Professionals programme, managed by the Swedish Institute (SI) and directed towards 41 selected collaborative countries (but not exclusively awarded to students from these countries), was SEK1.7 billion (US$181.6 million).\nThe aim of the programme is to strengthen leadership and capacity building in the collaborative countries and strengthen Sweden’s international collaboration.\nThe grants covered both tuition fees, living costs and travel support. Fifty-two per cent of the funding was directed at tuition fees, 45% for monthly living costs and 3% for travel support. The success rate of the programme was high: only 4% of the grantholders did not complete their studies.\nDuring the period 2013 to 2024, SI grant holders were accepted from 104 countries, the largest sending countries being Bangladesh (229 individuals), Ethiopia (198), Uganda (180), Rwanda (162), Kenya (156), Zambia (136), Sudan (132) and Indonesia (131).\nUsing the UN geographical region classification, Africa dominates in having the highest number of grantees, with 2,025 students, with 1,165 from the Asiatic group of countries, 412 from Latin America and the Caribbean, and 312 grantees from Eastern Europe.\nThe universities receiving the most students and the highest funding were Lund University (813, SEK360 million), Uppsala University (399, SEK184 million), KTH Royal Institute of Technology (274, SEK139 million), Gothenburg University (271, SEK126 million) and Umeå University (242, SEK108 million).\nA ‘limited’ investment\nHans Lundin, an international officer at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm who has published research papers on the tuition fee issue in Sweden – one exploring tuition fees as a policy instrument of internationalisation and another on fees as a policy instrument of cost sharing and control, or income generation – told University World News that the “vast majority” of the scholarships stem from the International Aid budget, with the aim to capacitate international students who are supposed to return home after their studies.\n“Although politicians frequently mention the importance of students coming and staying in Sweden as qualified workers, the investment to achieve such goals is rather limited. I don’t think the amount of these scholarships has increased since the introduction of tuition fees in 2011 (SEK60 million per year).\n“Furthermore, these scholarships do not cover living expenses. The internationalisation inquiry highlighted the fact that there are not really that many scholarships available for the purpose of strengthening Sweden as a knowledge nation,” Lundin said.\nIncreased collaboration\nInterest in the impact of tuition fees upon higher education in Sweden has been high, and the report discusses 22 contributions presented in the report.\nHowever, it is not often that those directly involved in the recruitment of fee-paying students report on their experiences.\nA report by Michael Oppenheimer of Dalarna University and Tomas Bengtsson of University West, published as a blog by the European Association for International Education website in the fall of 2023, noted that despite the initial decline in international student enrolments, the lasting legacy of the introduction of international student tuition fees has been an increased collaboration within the higher education sector.\nIn the wake of this new situation, a number of universities formed a collaborative group called “Study Destination Sweden”, wrote Oppenheimer and Bengtsson.\n“Twelve years after the introduction of tuition fees, most universities are active members in the Network for International Marketing and Communication (NIMK).\n“NIMK hosts workshops and inspiration days while also representing the interests of international student recruiters in national forums. Through the combined efforts of Swedish institutions and the Swedish Institute, the country has experienced a recovery in international student numbers,” they noted.\n“While the effects of tuition fees on higher education in Sweden continue to be debated, the focus has shifted towards maintaining a balance between affordability and sustaining the quality of education.\n“Even if the official stance from most universities is that tuition fees should not exist, an overwhelming majority of surveyed staff working with international students have said that they do not want to remove tuition fees.\n“The experience gained from managing the transition has enabled Swedish institutions to adapt and become more proactive and collaborative in their international recruitment efforts,” Oppenheimer and Bengtsson reported.\nQuestions about equity\nIn a  masters thesis in 2023 that examined the impact of the introduction of tuition fees in Sweden on international student mobility, Yixuan Sun wrote that despite the hope that the two scholarship schemes introduced at the time of the fee reforms would mean that wealthier international students would “self-fund” and Swedish taxpayer money could be “redirected to aid less financially stable international students and relieve the financial burden of the Swedish public fundings and ... ensure equity for international students from developing countries”, the findings indicate that the imposition of tuition fees for non-EU students still “significantly” influences the makeup of the international student population.\n“For instance, the student population from Pakistan, which was the second largest source of Asian students in Sweden in 2008 with 1,083 students, had reduced to just 602 by 2019. This is slightly more than half the number compared to the period before the introduction of tuition fees.\n“Similarly, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of international students from Iran. From a peak of 768 students in 2008, the count fell to just 290 in 2019, a drop of 62.2%,” Sun wrote.\nAndré Bryntesson, a member of the Higher Education and Research as Objects of Study (HERO) as well as the Swedish Centre for Studies of the Internationalisation of Higher Education at Uppsala University, who co-authored a 2019 study on international students in Sweden before and after the introduction of tuition fees and a 2018 report in which he argues that the tuition fees are set too high at Swedish universities in relation to the their cost covering objective, told University World News he agreed with Lundin about the inadequacy of funds allocated to attract highly qualified students.\n“A scholarship that only reduces tuition fees and does not cover living expenses is likely insufficient to attract some students to Sweden,” he said.\n“However, I would also like to reiterate the argument I’ve made elsewhere that I think it is highly problematic that tuition fees for students from developing countries are paid for through the Swedish development aid budget.\n“The reason is not only that fees are likely set too high (based on average rather than marginal costs), but that fees may also include things like marketing, new scholarships or capacity investments,” he added.\nThe need for data\nBryntesson said the report by Ramboll makes an important point regarding the lack of evaluation of the efficiency of the development aid scholarships.\n“While the policy of the Swedish Institute is that scholarship holders should return to their country of origin after graduation, it may very well be the case that the benefit for the country of origin and its people would be more substantial if the students were able to stay and work in Sweden instead, accumulating experience, building networks, sending substantial remittance money back home, and perhaps returning at a later point.\n“In the absence of evaluations, we don't know if the return home policy is good or if development aid is spent inefficiently on tuition fees,” Bryntesson noted.\nErika Dabhilkar, head of the international relations office at Research Support and External Relations at the Karolinska Institutet (KI) in Stockholm, said the KI awards grants are based on academic merit rather than financial need.\n“Nevertheless, most of these grants are awarded to tuition fee-paying students from low-income countries, particularly those pursuing studies in public and global health, as well as other areas within health and life sciences,” she told University World News.\n“Since medicine knows no borders, it is essential to educate talented individuals from less privileged regions who can contribute to strengthening health systems worldwide.\n“These grants help mitigate the negative effects of tuition fees for non-European students, ensuring that financial barriers do not prevent capable students from accessing high-quality medical education at KI,” she stated.\nProfessor Erik Renstrom, vice-chancellor of Lund University and chair of the internationalisation committee of the Association of Swedish Higher Education Institutions (SUHF), said the two scholarship programmes have contributed to Sweden being able to establish itself as an international study destination, but at the end of the day they financed a “very small part” of the international student population.\n“The major work is done at the universities, which supplement with their own scholarship programmes and other efforts.\n“A fundamental aspiration for many has been to achieve a truly international classroom where no single nationality dominates. For academic merit to be the guiding principle in selection, support is needed for less privileged students,” he noted.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Other countries are fully committed to knowledge and innovation. It is high time that the Netherlands does the same”.\nEducation is not a cost item\nUNL president Caspar van den Berg is quoted as saying: “What the Netherlands needs now is that politics from left to right starts looking at education, research and innovation as the strategic engine for prosperity, freedom and security.\n“This government did not do that and saw it as a cost item. It is to be hoped that political parties will quickly say goodbye to that short-sighted view and focus on what really helps the Netherlands move forward.”\nSpeaking to University World News, Ruben Puylaert, spokesman for UNL, said much was still unclear about what the government collapse will mean for universities.\n“The budget cuts for this year have been approved by parliament. However, the spring budget – which includes further cuts to higher education – still needs to be debated in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is still uncertain what impact the government-coalition collapse will have on the debate and vote in parliament on the spring budget,” he said.\nIn its own press release, the National Student Union (LSVb) said it was “with relief” that they noted that Wilders had left the coalition and the government had folded. They also expressed the hope, like UNL, that the fall of the government would mean changes in the university-related policies.\n“The National Student Union (LSVb) hopes that the fall of the government will mean the end of the terrible cuts and that the next government will invest in education, that the basic grant will increase and that there will be enough affordable student housing,” the press release stated.\nLSVb Chairman Abdelkader Karbache said: “The student movement is stronger than ever. Let this year's demonstrations be a warning to the next government. We have already stopped a large part of the cuts in education, and the budget has only been approved after months of delay and uncertainty.\n“Hopefully, it won't have to go that far again with the next government, but we are more than prepared to take to the barricades again. We are already in action mode!”\nWhat’s next?\nAnalysing the possible consequences for universities, VOX, the news magazine for the Radboud University of Nijmegen, said that the cuts in education and research will likely not disappear immediately.\n“One thing won’t change in the coming months: the government itself. It will continue to govern with an ‘outgoing’ status. The PVV ministers are stepping down, but Eppo Bruins is the education minister on behalf of NSC [National Social Contract] and is likely to remain in office until a successor takes over.\n“That could easily take a year. The previous government (with Minister of Education Robbert Dijkgraaf) continued to govern for 361 days before Prime Minister Dick Schoof’s team took office. The government before that (Rutte-III with Minister of Education Ingrid van Engelshoven) had an outgoing status for 360 days,” Vox wrote.\nHowever, Vox argued that the “Internationalisation in Balance” Act would probably not be put on the backburner, since its most controversial part – the government’s foreign language education test to establish the need for English-taught bachelor programmes – had recently been scrapped by Parliament.\n“The elections are an opportunity to reverse cutbacks, but it’s by no means a certainty that this will happen. That being said, it does seem unlikely that education and research will face even bigger cutbacks,” Vox argued.\nOngoing protest action\nMeanwhile, a new education-related strike is to take place on 10 June in The Hague, Ukrant, the magazine of Groningen University, reported.\n“Among others, the FNV trade union [Netherlands Trade Union Confederation] is calling on all RUG [University of Groningen] employees to participate in the new national education strike on Tuesday 10 June.\n“Under the motto ‘Stop the demolition’, thousands of people will probably travel to the Malieveld [Park in The Hague] that day to protest against the millions in cuts that the current government is imposing on higher education.\n“This strike follows the relay strikes of late March and early April, when universities went on strike one by one. The RUG also joined in on 18 March.\n“That strike culminated in a gathering of some 2,500 people on the Grote Markt. The unions had previously said they would continue demonstrating until something changed,” UKrant reported.\nIn its press release, FNV, the largest workers’ union in the Netherlands, said that getting rid of the Schoof government could be good also for higher education.\n“This dramatic cabinet has fallen; now their cutbacks,” said Sam Verduijn, head of FNV education and research.\n“The Schoof cabinet has made a mess of higher education. Jobs and training courses have disappeared due to indifferent, hard cutbacks of more than a billion euros. The workload and uncertainty are sky-high.\n“We sincerely hope that the next cabinet is convinced of the value of education and chooses to invest in the future of the Netherlands. Until then, we will continue to campaign to reverse the cutbacks, even if this cabinet continues in a caretaker capacity,” FNV said.\nKristy Claassen, a PhD candidate in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Twente, who has participated in the “Twente for Protest” action, said the collapse of the cabinet was a reminder of how quickly political tides can turn, for better or worse.\n“I hope this marks a shift in the right direction. Now, more than ever, education must remain at the heart of political priorities. What gives me hope is the emergence of strong activist networks in academia, as we have seen here in Twente, where the protest movement is more active and unified than ever before.\n“I believe this foundation will propel us forward in the coming months, whatever comes next,” she told University World News.\nCommitment to academic freedom\nEarlier, on 30 May, the rectors of Dutch universities issued a joint statement calling for respect for academic freedom at universities.\n“Universities must be able to operate independently, free from imposed political, ideological, or commercial influence. Institutional autonomy is not a privilege but a necessary condition for reliability and academic freedom. The government plays an essential role in safeguarding that autonomy,” the statement said.\nIndependent higher education strategist Peter van der Hijden said he saluted the rectors’ call for a national dialogue on academic freedom, which connects well with the Dutch tradition of “speaking your mind”.\n“Political parties will be open to arguments that interpret the nationalist Zeitgeist more positively, a window not to be missed,” he told University World News.\n“Therefore, universities should continue to demonstrate to the broader public their service to Dutch society in terms of appealing discoveries and their firm intention to open their degree-locked learning offer so that certified citizen-learners become allies and feel part of the local academic community,” he noted.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

That’s a good thing,” he noted.\nFluctuating student numbers have caused New Zealand’s universities significant financial difficulty since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but domestic numbers appear to have increased this year, and international enrolments have all but returned to pre-pandemic levels.\nNo change to funding levels\nUniversities New Zealand said by its calculation the net result of the government’s decisions was no change to their government funding next year.\nChris Whelan, its chief executive, said that was as good as the sector could expect given the difficult financial circumstances facing the government.\nHe said universities had had time to prepare for the government’s decisions, so the effect would not be as bad as he previously warned.\nBut, he said, overall funding still lagged behind rising costs.\n“Over the last five years, inflation’s been running at about 25%. Income, most of which is controlled by government, has probably gone up by about 15% ... So, we still have a gap,” he said.\nThe Tertiary Education Union was more outspoken in its criticism of the government’s decisions.\nThe union’s national secretary Dr Sandra Grey said even the funding increases for STEM subjects would not cover rising costs.\n“The shortfall of new money will be met by job cuts, increased student fees, and propping up the system by hoping more international students will come.\n“This is another example of a government that has created a fiscal hole, filling it by taking from the most vulnerable ... Instead of showing leadership by investing money in our future workforce, they would rather give tax breaks to landlords and tobacco companies.”\nConcerns over humanities\nCraig Marshall, an associate professor in the School of Biomedical Sciences at the University of Otago, said the government did not understand what a proper education system was.\n“For funding on STEM to almost match inflation is beneficial, but most universities would be looking at ways of ensuring that their humanities programmes remain viable,” he said.\n“If you don’t know the value of what people want and how they intend to use it, then the thing has little value. Humanities tell us about the way people think, which is something we also need to know.”\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Existing research partnerships and contracts will be honoured but not renewed.\nThe university said that there is “no evidence to associate any of these with breaches of international humanitarian law or human rights violations” and that it “cannot readily extract itself from these agreements”.\nHowever, it will not enter into any new European research consortia that involve Israel. It will also actively lobby the European Commission to exclude Israel from such collaborations.\nErasmus+ student exchange\nNor will the university continue to facilitate Erasmus+ student exchange agreements with Israeli universities. There are currently two Erasmus+ exchange agreements between Trinity and Israeli universities.\nIn an email to staff and students, it said that participation in these programmes has been “on an inbound basis only” since September 2023 and that no new agreements will be made after these end.\nThe Irish Times has reported that freedom of information records show the university’s endowment fund invested in 13 Israeli companies, three of which feature on a United Nations Human Rights Council list of companies involved in illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The university had already divested from some of these companies.\nThe decision by the country's oldest university caused little surprise in Ireland, which is one of the most trenchant critics of Israeli actions in Gaza and the West Bank and which was one of the first EU countries to formally recognise Palestine.\nAlthough the sixth president of Israel, Chaim Herzog, was born in Belfast and raised in Dublin, Ireland has long been a supporter of Palestinian rights. In 1980 it was the first EU state to endorse the idea of Palestinian statehood.\nThe Trinity moves were recommended by a task force comprising staff and student representatives which was set up last year as part of a deal to end a student Gaza Solidarity encampment on the campus. The protesters had prevented access to the university’s historic Old Library, which is one of Dublin's most popular tourist attractions.\nA ‘historic win’\nIn a statement following the vote, chairperson of the board of Trinity College Paul Farrell thanked members of the task force “who contributed significant time and expertise over the past year to consider these important issues so thoroughly”.\nOutgoing president of Trinity College Dublin Students’ Union Jenny Maguire welcomed the board’s decision, saying: “This historic win must be a catalyst for action across this island”. She thanked “everyone who has raised a sign, thrown down a tent and demanded a better world”.\nIt has been criticised by a number of individuals, including a financial supporter of the university, Dr Ed Abrahamson, who had cancelled his family’s bursary for disadvantaged students following what he said was the failure to protect Trinity's 100 or so Jewish students.\nIn December, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar ordered the closure of the country's embassy in Dublin, blaming Ireland’s “extreme anti-Israel policies”.\nSa’ar later said that Dublin encouraged antisemitism under the then prime minister Simon Harris, whom he accused of hating Jews. The Trinity decision has, however, been welcomed by the Embassy of the State of Palestine in Dublin.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

This is not protest – it is a calculated assault on dialogue, truth, and the fundamental dignity of an entire people.”\nThe Israeli embassy did not respond to a request from University World News to comment.\nOngoing protests\nSpeaking to University World News, Mohamed El Hassan Abdel Rahman, the deputy secretary general of the Mauritanian Medical Students Association in Dakar, described the actions by the students as a “courageous stance”.\nHe said the students’ actions embodied the university, which bears the name of a great fighter and one of the greatest defenders of justice and rights, Professor Cheikh Anta Diop, and “this university was and will remain a bastion of resistance and support for just causes, with the Palestinian cause at the forefront”.\nIn similar move to join the global students’ wave of outrage over the war on Gaza, some of Morocco’s student unions and other student groups joined a 28 May protest led by the Moroccan Front to Support Palestine and Oppose Normalisation in solidarity with the Palestinian people and protesting against “the crimes of genocide against the Palestinian people, the participation of the Zionist entity’s army in military exercises in Morocco, the continuation of official Moroccan normalisation with the Zionist entity and settler groups storming Al-Aqsa Mosque”.\nDeath and destruction in Gaza\nOn 28 May, which marked 600 days since Israel’s military invasion of Gaza, the estimated death toll in Gaza following Israel’s military operation stood at 54,084 (including about 8,304 women and 15,613 children) and more than 123,308 people had been injured, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) which also indicated that 87,000 tertiary students are left without access to formal learning space and 2,308 educational facilities, including universities, have been destroyed.\nAccording to an 8 April post on the official Facebook page of the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research, titled, ‘A summary of the impact of Israel’s attacks’, 1,180 members of the university community, including students and educational staff, have been killed and 5,719 injured. Also, 77 higher education buildings were completely or severely damaged in Gaza along with seven universities and colleges that were subjected to repeated raids.\nIsrael has kept Gaza crossings closed to food, medical and humanitarian aid since 2 March, deepening an already severe humanitarian crisis in the enclave.\nOCHA also noted that 100% of the analysed population in Gaza (2.1 million) is projected to face high levels of acute food insecurity classified as crises or above.\nIsrael’s military attack was triggered by the 7 October 2024 Hamas attack on Israel called ‘Al-Aqsa Flood’ during which 1,200 people were killed and around 240 hostages were seized. According to OCHA, on 28 May, an estimated 58 hostages remain in Gaza.\nOperation of Al-Aqsa Flood against Israel was aimed at alleviating the 16-year blockade in the Gaza Strip, end the Israeli occupation and recognise a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as the capital.\nThe International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.\nIsrael also faces South Africa’s genocide case at the International Court of Justice for its war.\nThis news report was updated on 5 June.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Attitudes towards GenAI also vary in different disciplines and faculties depending on perceptions and likely impacts of its use.\nThe challenges of adopting AI use in higher education and levels of AI competency among users were highlighted during an ethics and frameworks session at the virtual European University Association conference, titled “How universities are shaping the era of artificial intelligence” and held on 22 and 23 May.\nParticipants heard the experiences of three higher education institutions and how they were managing both the advances in the technology and its use among students and lecturers.\nA structural approach\nRoel De Meu, policy adviser at KU Leuven in Belgium, said the university was trying to approach the issue structurally, and it was important for practice to be underpinned by some guiding principles, such as transparency and verification, respect and responsibility, and sustainability.\n“Importantly, a key pillar of our approach is the skills gap, and we are all faced with that, especially in these stages of AI, and this is at several levels, inter- and intra-class between different staff and between support staff, who might already be more skilled in the use of GenAI than most or some of the students.\n“So, it’s important to invest in AI literacy at all levels of the university, including support staff, professors and also the students,” he stated.\nDe Meu said the university has assembled groups and committees to oversee AI use, user protections, and guidelines that would include all stakeholders in the institution.\nThis includes a table of information that students can use to check how they can use GenAI safely, honestly and with academic integrity. It helps students to be transparent about how they are using GenAI.\nHowever, Rune Vercauteren, a student at KU Leuven and a member of one of the GenAI committees at the university, stressed the widening of the skills gap among students in their knowledge of AI use.\n“Some don’t want to use it due to climate impact or fear of AI detection and getting penalties if it is not clear what the regulations are and what they’re allowed to do. Some students are more interested in AI and more technically skilled to use it.\nIt was clear that the AI usage gap was widening among students, “especially as the AI itself keeps getting better. We can see that in student assignments. There is a lack of clarity for students, and it is necessary for the university to set clear guidelines for its use.”\nMixed responses\nOther speakers also discussed the speed at which Gen AI was advancing and, in turn, the rate at which universities had to move to implement guidelines for its use, both practically and ethically.\nJames Mackay, associate professor of literature and digital culture at the European University Cyprus, said most universities had only relatively recently draughted and introduced guidelines around AI use to try to combat varying perceptions and misconceptions in use across different departments.\nHe said: “Our emphasis from the beginning was on guidelines. This arose from our first campus-wide consultation, which took place in February 2023 and which revealed an extremely wide range of responses across disciplines.\n“Within the department there were some academics, like me, who were enthusiastic experimenters, while others paid no attention whatsoever to generative AI. Some lecturers were punishing student use as simple plagiarism. Others were mandating Gen AI in their classes.\n“Some were putting all their trust in AI detection tools that had evident flaws, particularly for our students, while others were playing around with AI-assisted grading of student assignments,” Mackay continued.\n“Without a framework, there were evident reputational and even legal risks. At the same time, we had to recognise that uses varied by discipline, so medical sciences were very enthusiastic about AI-driven diagnostics and research, but in my own area of English literature you're immediately aware of the risk to original process-driven critical thinking,” he noted.\nA university-wide consultation on AI use delivered by a cross-disciplinary task group resulted in a framework at the university that is principle-based rather than prescriptive, with four core principles – human-centred inclusion, data privacy, safety and security, and communication.\nIt also explains the opportunities offered by the technology to automate routine tasks and to aid personalised learning experiences, Mackay added.\nAI in the institutional ethos\nMeanwhile, Dr Susanne Schumacher, co-chair of the digital council at Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) – which has an academic focus on film, music, drama and dance – said the diverse needs of its student and academic communities meant that competency development was a major challenge, alongside the rapid rate of AI development and the decentralised nature of the institution.\nHowever, unlike other conference participants whose universities have undertaken the creation of distinctly AI-focused frameworks and strategies, at ZHdK AI competency was embedded into its overall institutional culture and into existing programmes to build digital confidence among students.\n“We chose not to rely on a separate AI strategy but on the overall university strategy, which has a motto of artistic intelligence,” she said.\nInstead of an explicit strategy, “living documents” were created to establish the institution’s position on AI, which included an information sheet detailing rules around the use of AI from the university’s legal team.\nThe ZHdK also collected data through a university-wide survey that captured the extent of AI use and competency of AI users.\n“Students show a high level of critical awareness regarding the meaning and impact of AI. Text-based AI applications are widely used in different forms within the creative process,” Schumacher said, “and there is a growing demand and a strong willingness for critical and deeper reflection on AI.”\nThe university has an internal network that oversees aspects around digital technologies, including networking and exchanges of information and knowledge. There is also an AI forum and a curated online hub where tools are shared, and there are guidelines on its use, with signposts to useful resources.\nSchumacher added: “Reaching the next level of systematic integration of AI and an explicit AI strategy will be our next milestone. But we need a call to action. We need to keep asking, why are we using AI? How does it improve our work, and how can AI help us think and act better as humans in higher education?”\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The session highlighted practices of AI-driven learning and teaching.\nIn April 2024 Strikaite-Latušinskaja and Dr Paulius Jurcys, also a law lecturer, taught an intensive course on data protection and privacy law at Vilnius University and again in early 2025. “We knew right away back in 2024 that it couldn’t be a traditional course, not when students are already using various AI tools every day.\n“Instead of ignoring or discouraging them from the use of generative AI, we made a different choice. We decided to adapt the course to the reality of today’s students and teach them not only legal content but also how to work with AI tools properly, which is vitally important,” said Jurcys.\nThis was brought home to the law lecturers in 2023 when a New York lawyer used ChatGPT to find legal precedents – but several of them were fabricated. Judge P Kevin Castel stressed AI’s potential but criticised the lawyer’s lack of verification and warned of the vital need for responsible AI use with human oversight to ensure accuracy.\nThe avatar innovation\n“So from day one we told our students, use any AI tools you may find helpful,” he noted. This is stated clearly in the course materials. “This open approach led to meaningful conversations about source reliability, about hallucinations, about bias and what it means to trust or to question AI-generated answers. But actually, we didn’t stop there; we wanted to go one step further,” he explained.\nThe innovation of Strikaite-Latušinskaja and Jurcys began with this question: “What if each and every student could have a 24/7 version of their professor, ready to explain, guide or support them throughout the course? Imagine professors being available at 2am, without coffee, without the morning grumpiness, no office hours needed, just simply good WiFi.”\nThe young academics developed chatbot versions of themselves – Goda AI and Paul AI – which were trained on their academic work, lecture slides, research papers, course materials and so on. “They weren’t built on generic internet data.\n“They were designed to reflect how we teach, what we value, and how we explain things. They became a way for students to interact with our knowledge even when we weren’t available, outside office hours,” Strikaite-Latušinskaja noted.\n“As far as we know, this was the first time in the world where personal AI knowledge twins were integrated into a live university course.” She reads the AI-generated reports of student interactions every day, among other reasons, because it is informative to see what is asked and answered.\nStrikaite-Latušinskaja continued: “The avatars weren’t meant to replace us. They were designed to extend what we could offer. The idea was to make our knowledge accessible in a student’s own rhythm. Of course, once we introduced the knowledge twins, we couldn’t just keep teaching the same way we did before.”\nPushing boundaries is a challenge\nPushing boundaries and changing can be challenging, she acknowledged: “To be honest, it would have been much easier for us to reuse last year’s PowerPoint slides, ask a few multiple-choice questions and call it a day. But our students were evolving, so we had to.\n“First of all, we rethought all the lectures. If students could just pop a question and get an answer instantly to definitions, summaries and other information, there was no point in us repeating textbook content in class.\n“So we shifted toward more interactive sessions like debating, problem solving, analysing real-world examples, and so on. Since students could get answers quickly, from a teacher’s perspective this led to more sophisticated discussions. We’re not only talking about what something is; we’re focusing on why it is like that.”\nThen the big challenge came – the exam. Students were allowed to use AI tools during the exam, which forced a complete rethink of how to assess learning in general.\n“To prepare for the exam, we consulted with educators and edtech experts from Japan, the United States, Denmark and the Netherlands. It took us a while to come up with the exam task. In the end, we focused on open-ended questions requiring legal reasoning, practical application of knowledge and critical thinking.\n“We didn’t test what they knew, but how they thought,” she stated.\nStrikaite-Latušinskaja said students were positive about the experience of working with AI for learning. “One student told us. I’ve never seen AI and professors working hand in hand before, and it gave me confidence and curiosity throughout the course.’ Another said, ‘I often worry that I’ll forget something or I’ll misunderstand. AI gave me more confidence.”\nProgress but with downsides\nStrikaite-Latušinskaja and Jurcys are currently developing two sets of guidelines – one an AI knowledge plan and one teaching students so that they know how to prompt. “What we also discovered, which is an important issue, is that digital literacy among students is uneven.”\nThey are also working on a set of guidelines for other professors – how to use the AI twins, for example – because the plan is to expand this work to other faculties.\n“While this initiative has been positively received by many and students as well, we are also encountering some resistance from our colleagues, to be honest, who are hesitant to adopt AI twins in academic settings,” Strikaite-Latušinskaja noted. One reason is lack of familiarity with the tools, and another is that it needs additional time and resources to use AI tools effectively.\nOf course, said Strikaite-Latušinskaja, there are other challenges, such as academic integrity, data protection and transparency. “But ignoring AI doesn’t protect students. We believe it just leaves them unprepared. That’s why we believe that the future of education isn’t AI or human, but AI and human, working together, learning together, teaching together,” she emphasised.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

A developing disruption, according to Renda, is ‘digital twins’ for academics that can deliver lectures (in multiple languages) and interact with students.\nRenda has been very heavily involved in shaping rules on AI at the European Union level as a member of the EU High-Level Expert Group. He also led the impact assessment of what became the 2024 EU AI Act.\nHe was speaking at the 2025 European University Association AI Conference, “How universities are shaping the era of artificial intelligence”, held on 22 and 23 May, online from Brussels.\nIt seems that universities are being shaped by, as much as shaping, the era of AI.\nRenda believes universities need to think not only about how they bring disciplines together so as to study AI from a variety of perspectives but also “really focus on what makes us human in the sense of what agency and control will enable us humans in the future to make the most of our cooperation with machines.\n“This is essential. We have to find a way to accommodate AI in a human-centric way and find a new frontier for humans, for augmented humans”, he told a plenary session of the conference on principles and policies in AI and their implications for research and education.\nRenda has studied what happens to artists when they are challenged. For example, when photography challenged their painting skills, artists became more subjective and interpretive – think the Impressionists, the Cubists, contemporary art in general.\n“This is something we now have to replicate at scale for many other fields of study where the augmented human will have to focus on having agency and control of what AI can do and then specialise in what is eminently human,” he said.\nThe human component and critical analytical skills are what matter when becoming augmented humans.\n“I don’t think we are advanced enough in the study of this complementarity of skills going forward,” Renda said.\nThe 2025 EUA AI Conference\nThe EUA – an association of more than 800 universities as well as rectors’ conferences across Europe – has become acutely aware of challenges faced and the diverging approaches to AI among the university community.\nSome individuals and institutions are approaching AI cautiously and others with optimism, and some in the middle ground – cautious optimism.\nIn response, it established a group of experts to guide the work programme on AI.\nThe conference highlighted best practices, showing how some universities are deploying and supporting responsible use of generative AI; the importance of policies and guidelines; and the crucial need for training in AI competence among students, lecturers and staff.\nEUA membership and project coordinator Clare Phelan said universities in Europe had an “enormous appetite for guidelines that can support the creative and safe use of AI.\n“What we see is universities in this very interesting phase, a juncture perhaps, where they’re simultaneously developing strategies and still exploring the potential of the technologies.”\nThe outburst of experimentation with generative AI will inform decisions and policy-making around implementing AI in higher education, she said.\nWhile he has been involved with AI at the EU policy level, Andrea Renda has also been at the coalface of AI in education, as a university adjunct professor who – post November 2022 and the arrival of ChatGPT – faced the dilemma of whether to accommodate AI, embrace it and demand more from students, or ban it – or somewhere in between.\nIn Europe, Renda said, while levels of AI investment and progress have not been as high as in some other parts of the world, there are nevertheless hubs of excellence located in areas where universities play an important role – Paris, Eindhoven, and Munich. Even London post-Brexit, as it remains connected to Europe.\n“I’m currently in a research project that leads me to tour these ecosystems and hubs of excellence in AI.\n“You see how important the presence of an established tradition in engineering and social sciences is, universities that really shape the environment and have helped the local ecosystem to develop excellence in AI and related technologies. That is very important, but extremely localised,” he stated.\nThe EU tries to build solutions for all of Europe, Renda continued, but AI requires computer infrastructure, skills, relatively deep financial markets, and universities that are powerful and multidisciplinary. Europe will need to grasp the challenge of both deepening and spreading AI benefits.\nRegarding higher education, Europe trains more leading AI scientists than the United States (but not China), but very many end up in other parts of the world, especially America: “Let’s see what happens now,” he noted.\nA changing world is also changing higher education’s skills imperatives. While there has been a lot of emphasis on the STEM fields and coding, “today there is growing emphasis on other types of skills for the future, multidisciplinary skills, empathy and social skills, the ability to connect the dots, and the ability to bring disciplines together”, Renda said.\n“The future of humans is a future of generalists with deep knowledge of many fields. This is where we’re headed as mankind in the age of AI. We need to catch up with developments fast, and we have to think not only about the jobs of the future but also about the university of the future in a different way,” he noted.\nRenda screenshared a video clip of an avatar of himself, “a friend of mine”, which looks and talks like him, though it is still in draft form.\nThe digital twin, developed after Renda had spent less than 10 minutes reading a text and making facial expressions and so on, now says words he has never spoken – they were written for him.\nIt is already possible to use avatars for ‘master classes’ that are able to be taught in multiple languages. The digital twin can be interactive, in the way ChatGPT is, “and could become my own teaching assistant, trained on things I’ve written and said in the past.\n“It will be able to represent me while I’m hopefully somewhere on the beach. It can reach out everywhere in many languages, in an asynchronous way and in an interactive way.\n“As you can see, this has enormous opportunities”, said Renda. “But you can also see the enormous risks: impersonation, confabulations, hallucinations, deviations from reality, the same things that we see in a GPT today.\n“How do we master a world in which a few minds can spread their thoughts in an interactive way? We probably don’t need many mid-level scholars, but we need the top scholars because they can reach out with their avatars to many more people around the world. Are we going to need fewer universities?” he asked.\nHence the need for a university rethink.\nBuilding an AI ecosystem in Europe\nSession moderator Professor Wim van de Donk – rector of Tilburg University in the Netherlands and a board member of the EUA – said universities have, over the past 1,000 years, been confronted by new technologies, from the printed book to the internet.\n“The general notion about technologies in universities is that we tend to overestimate the consequences in the short term and to underestimate the consequences over the long term,” he said.\nThis may prove to be true for AI, but in the meantime, universities are responding, and there has been a lot going on at the policy level and in the private sector across Europe.\nThe 2024 EU AI Act – the world’s first comprehensive regulation on AI by a major regulator – and its Digital Decade strategy place strong emphasis on trust, transparency, safety and human-centred design.\nThe need to embed principles into practice across all curricula and research across Europe at local, regional, national and European levels was emphasised by Dr Jose Martínez-Usero, director for projects at DIGITALEUROPE, which represents digitally transforming industries and works closely with the EU to accelerate the digital transformation of Europe.\nThe question is how to translate these values into actual job roles or real skills? To this end, DIGITALEUROPE has been collaborating with Europe’s main standardisation bodies to develop standards for critical areas including AI, cybersecurity, data, and smart technologies.\nAt the end of last month, DIGITALEUROPE launched a free pre-standardisation activity and framework.\n“The objective is to define exactly the competencies and knowledge needed for professionals working in AI across different sectors in all of our countries,” said Martínez-Usero, who also teaches at the International University of La Rioja in Spain.\nUniversities across Europe are “helping to ensure our educational offer meets the evolving needs of AI labour markets, while at the same time being ethical and with scientific rigour”.\nBut there is a growing skills gap. Many thousands of professionals need to be skilled, reskilled and upskilled to work in the AI market. Martínez-Usero said that over 70% of member companies of DIGITALEUROPE and National Trade Associations report problems in recruiting AI professionals.\nFor the moment, only some higher education institutions in Europe offer dedicated AI programmes that are fully aligned with the market. Though, it is very difficult to understand what is fully aligned with the market when the market is evolving so fast.\n“We at DIGITALEUROPE, representing the digital transforming industries, are trying to tackle this scale-up together with many, many partners across academia and research. We are promoting scalable, certified and inclusive learning paths to meet real industry needs.\n“We need you to really innovate in the curriculum, to work across disciplines, and to embed both ethics and excellence in AI learning programmes.”\nEurope will depend not only on AI technology but also on an educational and job market ecosystem, said Martínez-User. “We have to do it together: academia, industry and policymakers,” he said.\nA tangle of AI and data laws\nThe final speaker was Dr Heidi Beate Bentzen, a lawyer and researcher in the Institute of Health and Society at the University of Oslo in Norway, who said the 2024 EU AI Act will be applied over two years and will harmonise AI rules across Europe.\nIt aims to promote the uptake of human-centric and trustworthy AI and uses a risk-based approach.\nThe AI Act does not replace any existing laws but is in addition to them. “The legal landscape for AI development is becoming very complex and fragmented, with rules spread across many legal instruments, each of which is quite comprehensive,” she said.\nJust one of these is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which covers processing of personal data.\nWhile the AI Act does not apply to AI systems developed for the sole purpose of scientific research and development, it does apply if an AI system is placed on the market as a result of research and development, Bentzen explained. Violations of the Act are serious, as they can carry fines of €35 million (US$39.88 million).\n“It’s worth noting that many large projects will have an AI component, and in many cases, it is completely unproblematic – but far from always. It’s therefore important also to keep in mind how the big funders deal with this issue,” Bentzen told the conference.\nThe EU requires ethics approval for a lot of the AI research it funds. “If your country or university does not have a system in place for ethics review of AI research, you may get a negative remark about this at the point where the project is shortlisted for funding but where the final decision is not yet made,” she noted. Having an ethics committee is a good idea, she added.\nSo, what is so special about AI research? “It’s mostly that existing ethics issues are exacerbated. For example, if you process personal data in research projects, you’re familiar with the ethical challenges that entails. But with AI on board, it often comes on a larger scale and with more ethically challenging processing methods,” she stated.\nBentzen outlined three less talked-about challenges for universities.\nEuropean universities face hidden legal challenges in AI collaboration with United States federal institutions. Because of US sovereign immunity, rights for EU research participants are not guaranteed. This breaches EU data protection laws and blocks legal data transfers, even for joint AI projects under US national labs.\n“This means that AI collaboration with some of the best research institutions in the field in the US is therefore highly legally complex and can quite easily lead to a breach of the GDPR, ” Bentzen noted.\nFurther, Bentzen said, EU rules treat pseudonymised data as personal. Re-identification risks are growing and are now accelerated by AI.\nStudies show that machine learning can re-identify individuals from anonymised data, which raises concerns for open science. To protect research participants, “data must be as open as possible, but as closed as necessary”.\nFinally, said Bentzen, “gone are the days where environmental impact largely focused on reducing the number of flights taken. AI is incredibly resource-demanding and has a huge environmental impact.”\nAI should therefore be used by universities with appropriate care, and environmental aspects of the work should be considered.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The online conference, titled “How universities are shaping the era of artificial intelligence”, was held on 22 and 23 May.\nNordic AI Hub\nProfessor Thomas Moeslund, from Aalborg University in Denmark, outlined how the university was working alongside Lund University in Sweden and Bergen University in Norway. All three institutions had anticipated the rise in technologies such as ChatGPT years ahead, with AI centres opening in 2019, 2018 and 2021, respectively.\nInitially, AI initiatives started out as small “bridging” interdisciplinary projects to see how information and experience might be shared within an institution. “The three universities are independent of each other, but all of us had built bottom-up initiatives with top-down support.\n“The money came from the top, but it was led from the bottom because it is researchers and educators who know what is needed,” said Moeslund.\n“For example, we engaged in ‘bridging’ projects which involved two different disciplines working together with funding of around €7,000 [US$8,000] per project. We were sceptical at first that they would want to get involved, but it turned out to be a huge success, especially for younger researchers because they built connections within the university.”\nAs AI evolved, universities began to discuss the implications with each other. Professor Kalle Åström, of the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at Lund University, said that an initial exchange of ideas led to the universities seeking funding from the Nordic Council of Ministers to allow the network to take off.\n“We use the funding for small projects, to run seminars and workshops, and to try out different models and ideas to promote AI use.\n“But we are also now onboarding other initiatives primarily in the Nordic countries and the Baltics. We are continuously talking to universities in these areas to try to find out if there are any other initiatives that would like to join the Nordic AI hub,” he said.\nIrish Innovation\nIn Ireland, meanwhile, seven universities are now accessing information, experiences and outcomes via an open access platform that shares case studies of how generative AI is being used.\nThe initiative was the brainchild of Dr Ana Elena Schalk and Dr Pauline Rooney from the Centre for Academic Practice at Trinity College in Dublin, who spotted the potential challenges that ChatGPT might cause.\n“We firmly believe that while generative AI raises challenges for us and for the academic community at large, it also presents opportunities for enhancing teaching, learning and assessment.\n“And this raised two pivotal questions for us. First, how can we best support our educators in responding to these challenges? And secondly, how might we influence and support strategic initiatives and policy development regarding generative AI at the institutional level?” Rooney explained.\n“We knew that colleagues across the sector were grappling with the same challenges, and so we decided that the best approach would be to tackle these questions together,” she noted.\nDiscussions were sought with colleagues in other Irish institutions to find out how AI was being used, and an open-access digital publication was created, which could be constantly updated with case studies and reflections on new developments and lessons learnt.\nEach institution had an ‘editor’ who brought together the stories from their university or college using a template which described the context of their innovation, how it was implemented and what results it showed. The site now has more than 30 articles from across all university disciplines and faculties.\nLeveraging expertise in Germany\nRuhr University Bochum is one of 40 universities in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, involved in projects relating to the use of AI technologies. The projects are funded by the state ministry of science after Ruhr University initiated the first strategy for meeting the challenges of new technologies.\nRobert Queckenberg, project coordinator at the university, said: “The project rests on three pillars, which support three strategies: giving staff and students safe access to commercial AI tools; evaluating the potential of open-source tools and providing training, guidance and networking activities.”\nThe network organises small-scale pieces of research and larger conferences and has some funding for projects at other universities, the outcomes of which can add to the sum of knowledge about AI use and applications. It also organises training activities and provides resources.\n“We have built, with good communication, network building and activities, a community of experts and institutions that we can leverage for the work we’re doing now and in the future,” Queckenberg added.\nLifelong learning in Belgium\nA regionalised approach is also used in Flanders, where the Flanders AI Academy (VAIA) has been established to deliver lifelong learning not only to university staff and students but also to upskill the existing workforce in AI use and knowledge.\nLise Hilte, liaison for the University of Antwerp at the VAIA, said: “We believe that lifelong learning is the key – to educate yourself and the entire staff of your institution, and in Flanders, the government is actively stimulating this.\n“We have an AI policy plan in place, with the AI Academy as a non-commercial institution to facilitate learning. But we also bridge the gap between industry and higher education.”\nThe VAIA has implemented a learning trajectory for learners, with a range of nine modules that learners can sign up for, including an introduction to AI, using AI for research and dealing with sensitive data. To date, more than 500 people in higher education institutions alone have already accessed the courses.\nAnother project focuses on the use of AI by doctoral students, said Tine Goovaerts, liaison for Ghent University at the VAIA. It analysed what Flemish universities themselves offered in terms of AI training.\n“We found that while the offer was quite big, it was very general and lacked the specific types of courses that would benefit PhD students. For example, it would be useful to know how AI can be used to benefit research and where I can find this,” she said.\nThe academy plans to create a separate training track, including a more modular course design, which would be tailored to the needs of specific groups of students, such as those doing PhDs.\nAs generative AI reshapes teaching and learning in universities across Europe, collaboration – not competition – has become key to tackling the technology’s complex challenges and opportunities. Perhaps, when it comes to AI, universities can achieve more together than going it alone.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The implications for universities, research institutions and the broader innovation ecosystem are nothing short of catastrophic.\nFor decades, the US has benefited immensely from the influx of international students, particularly those from China, who have contributed disproportionately to graduate programmes in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).\nAs of the 2023 to 2024 academic year, Chinese nationals comprised roughly 270,000 of the 1 million international students in the US, with nearly three-quarters pursuing STEM fields.\nAccording to the National Science Foundation, Chinese students earned 13% of all engineering doctorates and 15% of computer science doctorates in the US in 2022. Many went on to work in leading laboratories, corporate research divisions and academic institutions – becoming integral to the US research enterprise.\nLasting harm\nThere is no doubt that removal of this cohort will inflict lasting harm.\nUniversities will face both academic and financial repercussions. Chinese students, who largely pay full tuition at the undergraduate and masters levels, contribute more than US$15 billion annually to the US economy through tuition, fees and living expenses.\nInstitutions like Purdue University, Carnegie Mellon and the University of Illinois have long depended on these students to support graduate education and research productivity.\nIn many STEM departments, Chinese students account for 30-50% of doctoral enrolments. Losing them will significantly weaken the human infrastructure underpinning major federally funded research initiatives.\nMoreover, these students and scholars are not replaceable overnight. Their absence will delay research timelines, slow lab-based discoveries and reduce publication output. Projects in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, cancer therapy and climate modelling are at risk of stalling.\nFaculty who rely on graduate researchers from China will likely struggle to find equally skilled replacements, and many collaborative ventures involving Chinese and US counterpart institutions may be abandoned under political duress.\nA self-imposed disadvantage\nThe policy’s impact extends beyond academia. Chinese-born engineers and scientists play vital roles in US industry and entrepreneurship. Silicon Valley is replete with Chinese-American innovators, including Eric Yuan (founder of Zoom), Jensen Huang (CEO of NVIDIA) and Jerry Yang (co-founder of Yahoo). These individuals began their journeys in US universities and built companies that now form the backbone of global digital infrastructure.\nWithin national labs and corporate research and development centres, Chinese and Chinese-American scientists contribute at the highest levels.\nThough they comprise less than 2% of the US population, individuals of Chinese descent account for over 10% of PhD-trained professionals in high-priority fields such as semiconductors, synthetic biology and advanced materials. Their forced departure risks creating a brain drain of America’s own making.\nPerhaps most dangerously, the Trump administration’s decision sends a signal to the global academic community: the United States is no longer a stable or welcoming destination for top talent.\nThis reversal of image – so carefully cultivated by American universities over the past half-century – could lead to long-term reputational damage.\nCompetitor nations such as Canada, the UK and Germany are already stepping up efforts to recruit the very students the US is expelling. And Chinese institutions are more than willing to welcome them back home.\nThe history is ominous. This mass visa revocation echoes the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and post-9/11 visa restrictions that decimated international enrolments.\nThese precedents demonstrate that once trust is lost, it can take decades to rebuild. In a globally competitive knowledge economy, the US may soon find itself at a huge disadvantage it imposed upon itself.\nThe cost of silence\nUniversity presidents, faculty leaders and higher education associations must speak with urgency and clarity. This is not merely a policy disagreement; it is an existential threat to the global engagement that has defined American higher education since the Second World War. The costs of silence are too great.\nHigher education institutions cannot remain on the sidelines as political decisions dismantle the very structures that have allowed them to thrive.\nIt is imperative that the sector mobilise – through legal challenges, coordinated advocacy and reaffirmation of core values – before the damage becomes irreversible.\nThe United States became a global leader in research and innovation not by closing its doors but by opening them to the world’s brightest minds. The revocation of Chinese student and scholar visas not only contradicts that legacy – it endangers the future of US leadership in science, technology and higher education.\nDenis Simon is a visiting professor in the Asian Pacific Studies Institute at Duke University and a non-resident fellow at the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft in DC.

It is interesting to note that even South Africa is mentioned as a country that is quietly making strides towards increasing its market share for hosting international students.\nYet, unlike some of the emerging countries that are mentioned in the study, India, traditionally a major sending country, has a competitive edge due to its widespread usage of English, which in the long run will assist in attracting international students in combination with recent investments in emerging technologies and other innovations.\nFocus on technology\nThough India is still not one of the nations that has a substantial market share in the global student mobility space, the country has launched noteworthy initiatives to develop education and talent in areas that have a strong academic focus on critical and emerging technology.\nThis transformation stems from India’s strategic imperative to enhance capabilities in areas like space science and technology, semiconductors and quantum computing, areas that are essential for national self-reliance and global competitiveness. The India Semiconductor Mission and the National Quantum Mission are part of the country’s broader efforts not only to become a self-reliant economy but also to take a leadership role on the global stage.\nThe All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the statutory body overseeing the development and planning of technical education in India, has introduced new undergraduate and postgraduate programmes on semiconductors and quantum computing.\nIn 2023, over 600 engineering colleges launched semiconductor technology programmes across all degree levels, offering more than 16,000 places. Beginning in July 2025, AICTE will roll out undergraduate programmes in quantum technology at 75 universities.\nThese initiatives aim to enhance the employability of graduates in both domestic and global markets. By rapidly expanding these cutting-edge programmes nationwide, the government seeks to build a robust pipeline of industry-ready professionals.\nIn a short time span, India has transitioned from a beginner to an emerging global player in several critical and emerging technology domains.\nLeveraging India’s advantages\nOne of the reasons for India emerging as a leading student-sending destination is, ironically, the combination of ‘push factors’ which made India unattractive to its own students who could afford to pursue quality higher education abroad.\nThat trend is now changing with institutions in India rolling out new courses that are more aligned to the emerging needs of India and the world, with returning students putting their knowledge of new technologies to good use to build India’s standing.\nIndia can offer the world high-quality education at a significantly lower cost. The academic quality of its programmes and the dynamic curriculum are elements that Indian institutions need to highlight, both to domestic and international constituents, as part of their internationalisation strategy.\nThe new academic programmes are being offered across all types of educational institutions in India, ranging from reputed public universities like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology to private universities.\nSome private universities are offering these programmes in collaboration with the IITs to enhance students’ academic credentials. In addition, the leading body involved in skills development in India is providing industry internships that will lead to future career opportunities.\nDisproportionate focus on dual degrees\nOver the past five years, as part of the internationalisation strategy as envisioned in the National Education Policy 2020, there has been a disproportionate focus on rapidly establishing dual-degree programmes with foreign universities.\nDual-degree programmes remain one of the most sought-after partnership models for Indian universities, yet they are often difficult to implement effectively. Disparities in accreditation standards, curriculum structures and credit recognition between Indian and foreign institutions present significant hurdles.\nHowever, what is increasingly emerging are pathway programmes, where students begin their academic journey at an Indian institution, but transition to a foreign university to complete their degree.\nIn most of these arrangements, students ultimately receive their first degree from the Indian institution but spend considerable time and money at the foreign partner university, often without the full benefits of an internationally conferred credential. These programmes often come at a high cost and are available in popular but limited academic disciplines, such as data science, business and finance.\nFuture-oriented curricula\nAs India strengthens its position as an emerging economic powerhouse, its focused efforts to develop a skilled talent pipeline in critical and emerging technologies are beginning to reshape the country’s academic ecosystem. Universities across India are introducing robust, future-oriented curricula at both undergraduate and graduate levels in areas such as quantum computing, semiconductors, artificial intelligence (AI) and space science and technology.\nDisseminating information early – while students are still exploring higher education options – can empower them to make informed, future-ready decisions. In alignment with the growing emphasis on future-oriented education, Indian school boards are increasingly incorporating emerging technologies like AI, robotics and data science into their curricula in line with the National Education Policy.\nThe Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has offered AI as an elective since 2019, while the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) introduced AI and robotics for Classes IX and X in 2023-24 and plans to expand that to senior secondary levels by 2025-26. State school boards, including West Bengal and Assam, have also begun offering AI and data science at senior secondary levels.\nIndian higher education should embark on outreach initiatives, which should include partnerships with high schools and national awareness campaigns and should organise immersive summer camps at premier institutions like the IITs, allowing students to engage first hand with emerging disciplines.\nEncouraging both students and their parents to critically evaluate the academic and financial dimensions of studying in India versus abroad will help position Indian programmes not only as being cost-effective but also academically competitive alternatives on the global stage.\nA unique opportunity\nOver the next five to 10 years, as geopolitical uncertainty continues to reshape traditional patterns of international student mobility, India has a unique opportunity to emerge not just as a major talent exporter, but also as a compelling destination for domestic and international students.\nWith its investment in critical and emerging technologies, its expanded academic offering and its commitment to affordable, high-quality education, India is well-positioned to claim a meaningful share of the global student mobility market.\nBy aligning national education priorities with global demand and reinforcing its internationalisation efforts, India can transform itself from a peripheral participant to a central player in the global higher education ecosystem.\nDr Diya Dutt is adviser to the Association of Indian Universities and Sudarshan Saha is founder-director of the Center for Study Abroad, India.\nThis article is a commentary.

Ngugi, a towering intellectual figure, a fierce advocate for linguistic decolonisation, and a political dissident of global resonance, has produced an oeuvre that extends far beyond his fiction.\nHe redefined the purpose of African literature, insisting that it must speak to its people in their own languages, reflect their histories, and resist the epistemic violence of colonial modernity.\nThis essay seeks to trace the core elements of Ngugi’s intellectual and artistic legacy, examining the evolution of his literary consciousness, his pivotal shift to writing in Gikuyu, his contribution to African thought, and the unfinished project of decolonisation that he so passionately championed.\nThe making of a literary icon\nNgugi’s early literary success was meteoric. At Makerere University, Uganda, he wrote his first major novels, Weep Not, Child (1964) and The River Between (1965), which quickly established him as one of Africa’s most compelling literary voices.\nBoth novels, written in English, explored the cultural and political disruptions caused by colonialism in Kenya. But, as he would later reflect, this early period of acclaim also masked an internal contradiction: the medium through which he wrote, English, was itself a vehicle of colonial domination.\nIn My Life in Between Languages, Ngugi recalls, “I started writing seriously in the 1960s … in English. It seemed natural. The writers that I had read and studied had written in English.” At that time, the very idea of writing in African languages was marginalised, even among Africa’s emergent literary elite.\nNonetheless, even within the anglophone mode, Ngugi’s writing was never apolitical. His works such as A Grain of Wheat (1967) and Petals of Blood (1977) reveal his commitment to portraying the contradictions of post-independence Kenya, where the promises of liberation were increasingly betrayed by elite capture, economic inequality, and neo-colonial repression.\nIn Writers in Politics (1981), he stated unequivocally that the writer is “a pathfinder” who must uncover “the social conflicts and tensions in his changing society”.\nLinguistic decolonisation and the turn to Gikuyu\nThe true revolution in Ngugi’s intellectual trajectory came in the late 1970s. Disillusioned by the limits of writing in English, Ngugi began to champion African languages as a foundation for cultural reclamation.\nThis transition was not merely linguistic, it was epistemological and political. The turning point was his involvement in community theatre in Kamirithu, where he co-wrote Ngaahika Ndeenda (I Will Marry When I Want) (1970) a Gikuyu-language play that exposed the exploitation and hypocrisy of Kenya’s ruling elite.\nThe play’s popularity among ordinary citizens quickly drew the ire of the state. Ngugi was imprisoned without trial in 1977, an act that transformed him from a dissident intellectual to a political martyr.\nDuring his imprisonment, Ngugi composed Caitaani Mutharaba-Ini (Devil on the Cross) (1980) on toilet paper, the first modern novel written in Gikuyu. This was not only a symbolic act of defiance but also an affirmation of linguistic dignity.\nFor Ngugi, language was not just a medium of communication; it was a carrier of memory, identity, and worldview. His now-famous work Decolonising the Mind (1986) became a manifesto for linguistic decolonisation: “Language carries culture, and culture carries … the entire body of values by which we come to perceive ourselves and our place in the world.” He argued that writing in European languages perpetuated a colonial hierarchy of knowledge and that African writers must embrace indigenous languages to truly liberate their narratives.\nAs he poignantly noted, “The domination of a people’s language by the languages of the colonising nations … is the most effective form of enslavement.” In this context, Ngugi’s refusal to write fiction in English after 1977 was not a rejection of readership, but a radical realignment of whom his writing was for, and whose stories deserved primacy.\nThe Writer as Revolutionary\nNgugi did not merely theorise the writer’s role; he embodied it. As Dr Nasir Umar Abdullahi notes, Ngugi’s work consistently performed “the role of a leader, who leads his or her society to a better tomorrow, a social prophet who delivers an instructive message … a revolutionary”.\nHis literature critiques, not only colonialism, but also its afterlives in the form of corrupt governance, capitalist exploitation, and the erosion of African cultures under globalisation.\nThis revolutionary stance placed him in the lineage of Frantz Fanon, Amílcar Cabral, and other thinkers who viewed cultural resistance as central to liberation.\nNgugi’s insistence on structural change, including in education, language, and power, was part of a broader critique of the neocolonial state. Unlike many of his contemporaries who remained within academic or literary circles, Ngugi’s blurred the lines between intellectual, activist, and artist.\nIndeed, Ngugi’s career maps the trajectory of an African intellectual who refused to be co-opted by dominant power structures. From his early days at the University of Nairobi, where he helped establish African literature as a legitimate field of study, to his years in exile in the United Kingdom and United States, he remained a staunch advocate for the poor and the marginalised. Even after returning to Kenya in the 2000s, Ngugi continued to agitate for linguistic justice, educational reform, and the democratisation of knowledge.\nExile, return, and the global stage\nNgugi’s decades in exile did not mute his voice. Rather, they amplified it. While in exile, he published extensively, delivered lectures across the globe, and continued to reflect on the conditions of African modernity. He held professorial positions at Yale, New York University and the University of California, Irvine, where he founded the International Center for Writing and Translation.\nDespite this international recognition, Ngugi never distanced himself from the struggles of ordinary Africans. In fact, his later works, including Dreams in a Time of War (2010), In the House of the Interpreter (2012), and Birth of a Dream Weaver (2016), form a trilogy of memoirs that revisit his youth through the prism of language, colonial education, and resistance.\nThese works demonstrate a masterful blend of personal memory and political analysis, reaffirming his commitment to the broader struggles for freedom and dignity.\nHis final years were marked by numerous accolades, including honorary doctorates, international prizes, and perennial nominations for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Yet he remained grounded, often reiterating that the real prize would be the flourishing of African languages and literatures.\nThe enduring legacy\nNgugi wa Thiong’o’s legacy is multifaceted. As a novelist, he expanded the possibilities of African narrative forms, bridging oral traditions with the novel. As a theorist, he reshaped debates on postcolonial identity, language, and the politics of culture.\nAs an educator and public intellectual, he inspired generations of writers, scholars, and activists to think critically about the lingering structures of coloniality.\nImportantly, his call for linguistic decolonisation remains urgent. In a continent where European languages still dominate education, media, and government, Ngugi’s challenge to return to African languages as a basis for epistemic justice has yet to be fully realised.\nAs he once asked: “How can a nation be said to be independent if it still communicates with itself in the language of its former colonisers?”\nBeyond Africa, Ngugi’s ideas resonate with indigenous struggles across the globe – from the Americas to Oceania, where communities continue to fight for cultural survival and linguistic revival. His legacy is, thus, not only African but global.\nA path yet to be completed\nNgugi wa Thiong’o’s life was a testament to the power of language, memory, and resistance. He taught us that literature is not neutral; it is either complicit in domination or complicit in liberation. In choosing the latter, he carved a path that many fear to tread, one that demands intellectual courage, cultural fidelity, and political conviction.\nHis death is not an end, but a call to action. As we mourn his passing, we must also recommit ourselves to the ideals he so passionately defended: the right of every people to speak, write, dream, and imagine in their own tongue; the responsibility of writers to confront injustice; and the necessity of decolonising, not only our institutions, but our imaginations.\nNgugi wa Thiong’o lived, wrote, and resisted between languages, between worlds, and between epochs. He has now joined the ancestors, but his words, his vision, and his fire endure.\nProfessor Emnet Tadesse Woldegiorgis is the director of the Ali Mazrui Centre for Higher Education Studies at the University of Johannesburg, South Africa. As a PhD student in Germany, Woldegiorgis took a course given by Ngugi wa Thiong’o and engaged in his intellectual discussions.\nThis article is a commentary.

Meanwhile, 60% of employers struggle to find skilled workers, underlining the urgent need for upskilling and reskilling.\nAs the region experiences a demographic peak in its working-age population, microcredentials can support workforce readiness, promote social mobility and advance lifelong learning, particularly for marginalised communities.\nOne in three students in the region has already earned a microcredential, primarily driven by the desire for employability. Meanwhile, most institutions that are not currently offering microcredentials intend to do so within the next five years.\nThese trends signal a growing need to integrate microcredentials into national education policies and workforce development strategies.\nLearners – particularly older adults, women and those from rural or lower-income backgrounds – are increasingly turning to microcredentials. Female participation is higher than in most regions, with many women pursuing STEM fields.\nEmployers also recognise the value of microcredentials, especially in addressing skills mismatches; however, adoption remains uneven due to concerns about the variability in quality.\nHigher education institutions and private providers dominate microcredential offerings in the region. Higher education institutions are the primary source of course content, often partnering with digital learning platforms to provide students with access to relevant materials. Coursera and edX are the most popular. Tech giants whose primary business is not education, as well as intergovernmental organisations, are also playing a growing role.\nAt the same time, regional providers, such as the Crehana and EducaciónIT platforms, as well as Laboratoria – a startup targeting disadvantaged women – are gaining traction. Some studies suggest that localised providers can achieve higher completion rates among learners, as they are more attuned to local needs, thereby also reducing systemic dependencies on global providers.\nDigital certification platforms support distributed, secure and transparent certification systems, but reliance on these can pose challenges in terms of technology dependency and sustainability.\nThe rapid proliferation of microcredentials has revealed several bottlenecks that could undermine their long-term sustainability if left unaddressed.\nInternational consensus on a definition of microcredentials has been difficult to achieve, as the field is relatively new and unregulated. This is particularly evident in the variation regarding course duration and number of credits. National definitions are rare in the region. These are far more prevalent among higher education institutions.\nTo guide policy-makers in defining what microcredentials constitute, UNESCO IESALC proposes an overarching definition in the study, which may evolve as the field matures.\nRegulation and quality assurance\nMost countries are also still in the early stages of developing regulatory and quality assurance frameworks. A few are initiating important reforms, such as Jamaica, Uruguay, Chile and Colombia.\nWhile overregulation should not be the goal, establishing national frameworks can help standardise quality and enable providers to develop specifications that suit their specific contexts.\nMicrocredentials could also be integrated into national qualifications frameworks (NQFs) – which are still under development in many countries. In Latin America and the Caribbean, often, the main objective of NQFs is to facilitate lifelong learning – an approach that can readily incorporate microcredentials.\nUNESCO’s recognition conventions provide a foundation for enhancing the quality assurance and recognition of microcredentials as components of prior or partial learning and underscore the need for interlinking national, regional and global systems. However, balancing harmonisation and cultural relevance remains a critical challenge for many countries in the region.\nThe uncontrolled expansion of microcredentials risks market saturation and credential inflation, which could dilute their value and fragment learning pathways. A sustainable ecosystem in the region must encourage cross-provider collaboration, such as through joint course development, stackable credentials, public-private partnerships, credentialing networks and resource sharing. Engagement with industry and learners is crucial to ensure relevance and adaptability.\nHigher education institutions often face difficulty in integrating microcredentials into traditional curricula, requiring flexibility in academic structures and arrangements for the recognition of prior and subsequent learning. Faculty buy-in is usually the top challenge to expansion.\nInvesting in capacity development at national and institutional levels is essential to reverse these trends. Over the last two years, several sub-regional initiatives have emerged, such as those of INQAAHE-REALCUP or MOCHILA or the Commonwealth of Learning and Caribbean Examinations Council. However, more is needed to achieve the scale of transformation required.\nMicrocredentials are more affordable than traditional degrees, yet their financial sustainability remains a concern. Many rely on short-term public funds or one-time investments. Low-income learners also often face hidden costs, such as access to devices and the internet. Governments should establish continuous financial support schemes for providers and learners and also consider innovative financing models that combine cost-sharing and public-private partnerships.\nOverall, the evidence is limited regarding the impact of microcredentials on improving employability, social mobility and lifelong learning. Robust monitoring and evaluation systems are needed to track learner outcomes, employer uptake and alignment with national skills needs. This would facilitate continuous improvement of policies, offers, quality assurance and funding models.\nRegional framework\nUNESCO IESALC is leading the development of a regional framework setting minimum standards on microcredentials, focusing on design, management and quality assurance to guide policy-makers and providers.\nA draft was presented at the Meeting on the Quality Assurance and Regulation of Microcredentials in Montevideo, Uruguay, on 26 and 27 May, supported by the Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean and Uruguay.\nThe framework will undergo a broad consultation process with key stakeholders across the region, with the goal of adoption in the coming months. A capacity development offer through the Campus IESALC hub will support it.\nFrancesc Pedró is the director of the UNESCO International Institute for Higher Education in Latin America and the Caribbean (UNESCO IESALC).

The findings of that study have now been published.\nThis study is a follow-up to previous research that examined Italian universities’ perspectives on post-Brexit collaborations with UK institutions.\nIt expands on that research by incorporating the viewpoints of UK higher education providers and focusing more specifically on academic cooperation through double degrees and transnational education (TNE) partnerships. It also addresses related topics, such as student mobility and research collaboration.\nThe final report provides an overview of UK-Italy higher education cooperation, focusing on student mobility, TNE, and research, along with the policy environment for inbound TNE in Italy.\nIt presents findings from surveys, interviews and a workshop at the Italy-UK Pontignano Conference 2024. It includes recommendations for policy measures to strengthen academic cooperation. It also includes lists of existing UK TNE partnerships and UK-Italy double degree programmes as well as case studies of UK validation and franchise partnerships in Italy.\nImportantly, the report includes several policy recommendations aimed at strengthening bilateral academic ties. One such recommendation urges the UK government to pursue post-Brexit agreements with EU member states to facilitate reciprocal student mobility.\nThe recent announcement of a new UK-EU agreement, which includes plans for deeper collaboration through a “youth mobility scheme” and raises the prospect of the UK rejoining the Erasmus+ programme, is a particularly encouraging development for the future of UK-Italy academic cooperation.\nUK-Italy academic cooperation\n• Student mobility:\nThere has been a significant decline in Italian students enrolling in UK higher education since the UK’s departure from the European Union, with a 51% drop overall and a 57.8% decrease in first-year enrolments between the 2020 to 2021 and 2023 to 24 academic years.\nHowever, most of the decline occurred in the first few years, and mobility from Italy has since stabilised. This mirrors broader trends with EU student mobility to the UK.\nInterestingly, in the same period, there has been a 15.3% increase in UK students enrolling in Italian universities, with Italy representing the fourth most popular country under the Turing outward mobility programme.\nDespite these trends, the UK remains a popular destination for Italian students, and there is still a significant difference in student flows between the two countries.\n• Transnational education:\nIn 2023 to 2024, there were 2,885 students enrolled in UK TNE programmes in Italy, making Italy the 10th largest destination for UK TNE in the EU. This represents a 19% growth since 2018 to 2019, before COVID-19 and the UK’s departure from the EU.\nJust over 50% of UK TNE in Italy is offered through distance learning, the remaining through validation and franchise partnerships with local institutions, often in niche subject areas.\nBased on a comprehensive review of Italian and UK universities’ websites, there are currently just over 60 known double degree programmes between UK and Italian universities, with the UK ranking fifth among countries with such agreements with Italy. Italy, in turn, is the fourth-largest partner country for double degree agreements with UK universities.\n• Research:\nItaly is a key research partner for the UK, with Italian academics forming one of the largest foreign communities in the UK higher education sector.\nThis significant presence of Italian academics in the UK has been crucial in maintaining strong academic ties between the two countries. However, recent trends show a decline in the number of Italian academic staff in the UK.\nDespite concerns surrounding the impact of Brexit, Italian researchers remain keen to continue collaborating with the UK. European funding has traditionally supported most research collaboration between the two countries.\nThe UK’s quick re-entry into Horizon Europe is therefore regarded as crucial for preserving and strengthening ongoing research collaboration.\n• The Italian policy landscape for TNE:\nThe Italian policy landscape for inbound TNE distinguishes between two main types of foreign higher education presence: branch campuses and subsidiaries (filiazioni).\nBranch campuses allow foreign institutions to offer study programmes and award degrees recognised in Italy. Currently, only one branch campus, the French ESCP Business School, operates in Italy.\nSubsidiaries, on the other hand, enable foreign institutions to decentralise part of their academic programmes in Italy, primarily for study-abroad purposes. There are over 130 subsidiaries (or study abroad centres) in Italy, all operated by US universities.\nThere are legal constraints regarding the decentralisation of full degree programmes, particularly in regulated fields such as medicine, to avoid an oversupply of graduates in these regulated professions.\nRecognition of TNE qualifications in Italy requires compliance with strict quality and equivalence criteria, including institutional recognition, scientific relevance, adequate facilities and faculty qualifications.\nQualifications from validated or franchised partnerships are not recognised in Italy due to quality and quality assurance concerns. There might be potential to overcome these recognition barriers through improved cooperation in quality assurance between Italian and UK regulatory and quality assurance bodies.\nFindings from stakeholder engagement\n• Fees and visa regimes:\nBrexit has significantly hindered academic collaboration between Italian and UK universities, primarily due to increased tuition fees for Italian students and complex visa requirements, especially for stays over six months.\nThe UK’s withdrawal from Erasmus+ has further strained mobility programmes, although UK and Italian providers have tried to mitigate impacts, such as through institutional financial support, short-term options (for example, summer schools), and virtual and hybrid models.\nPostgraduate programmes and cooperation with Italian private universities are less affected, while undergraduate exchanges and internships face the most challenges.\n• Reciprocity:\nDiffering fee structures and an imbalance in student mobility hinder UK-Italy academic collaboration, with far more Italian students studying in the UK than vice versa.\nBarriers include limited English-taught programmes in Italy (although numbers are quickly growing), differing durations of masters programmes and UK students’ reluctance to study abroad.\nThe Turing scheme aims to support UK mobility but faces challenges, such as insufficient funding for disadvantaged students and declining modern language programmes, which have traditionally driven UK student exchanges – although four of the five top destinations for Turing-funded students are EU countries, with Italy being the fourth most popular destination under the Turing programme.\n• Awareness of opportunities and strategic alignment:\nStrategic misalignment and limited awareness of existing opportunities hinder UK-Italy academic cooperation.\nUK providers and students are often unaware of Italy’s growing offer of English-taught programmes and underestimate the quality of higher education in Italy. Perceptions of Italy as bureaucratic and less receptive to internationalisation further deter collaboration.\nDespite Italy’s growing internationalisation efforts, UK providers often prioritise markets with higher student volumes, although Brexit has prompted some to reconsider European partnerships as part of a strategic decision to strengthen engagement with EU countries, including Italy.\nBoth UK and Italian providers see the potential role that the British Council, working with sector bodies such as Universities UK and the Conference of Italian University Rectors, could play in facilitating reciprocal understanding and creating networking opportunities.\n• Research:\nResearch cooperation between Italian and UK universities, traditionally supported by EU funding like Horizon 2020, faced challenges during the UK’s brief exit from Horizon Europe. The UK’s re-entry is seen as positive, though rebuilding trust and collaboration may take time.\nBoth sides emphasise the importance of joint PhD programmes, research mobility and leveraging Italian academics in the UK to strengthen ties, particularly with renewed access to Horizon Europe funding opportunities.\nWhere next?\nCosts are an important factor to address. A recommendation coming from the report’s findings is that the UK government should explore post-Brexit agreements with EU countries to facilitate reciprocal student mobility and lower costs via government or institutional initiatives. The announcement this week is a start, and we await the details.\nWhen it comes to strategic priority areas, institutions should prioritise short-term mobility opportunities to boost two-way student mobility, such as summer schools.\nThey should also look to expand virtual exchanges, develop joint PhD programmes, increase English-taught programmes at Italian universities, and leverage European University Alliances.\nIn addition, UK and Italian sector bodies should facilitate a better understanding of each other’s higher education systems and opportunities for collaboration. The British Council can play a key role in these efforts.\nAs far as TNE is concerned, a dialogue needs to be established between the quality assurance and regulatory bodies of both countries to foster mutual understanding of TNE, its quality and quality assurance, and support reciprocal recognition, thus unlocking TNE’s potential to meet ongoing demand for UK degrees in Italy while supporting Italy’s aims to retain talent and attract international students.\nFinally, a joint UK-Italy taskforce is needed to address key challenges and find actionable solutions for long-term academic collaboration.\nDr Fabrizio Trifiró is an international education expert and practitioner, with over 15 years’ experience in the quality assurance and regulation of international education. He recently hosted a podcast series on ‘Experiences of International Education’. Fabrizio is a member of the board of directors of the International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education and has recently taken on the role of programme director for the Education World Forum, now under the stewardship of Times Higher Education.\nThis article is a commentary.

The arrangement is usually that these international campuses are locally managed, owing in many cases to legislative restrictions, which can lead to several challenges.\nThe local management of the international campus, by people who may not have experience of working in higher education, can often be different to the management and employment practices of the home campus. It is especially problematic when expatriate academics employed at the international campus, usually hailing from the Global North, expect alignment between operations at the international and home campuses, especially if this is their first experience of employment overseas.\nIt can be a particularly jarring experience for academics who witness such incongruities first-hand if their expectations were not initially managed at the point of recruitment and job offer.\nMore troubling than unmet expectations can be instances of unethical employment practices at the international campus, which the home campus may distance itself from, leaning on the fact that employment is a local issue and any problems should therefore be locally resolved.\nPoor employment practices, so-called toxic workplace cultures, lack of adjustment support and underdeveloped infrastructure can lead to workplace challenges and consequently poor well-being for expatriate academics, and inevitably contribute to the high turnover rates often witnessed at international campuses.\nDuty of care\nThe home campus needs to recognise that, just as corporations cannot be absolved of issues along their supply chain, the home campus needs to be mindful of the operations of the international campus and the situation for staff working there.\nOne way for the home campus to meet its duty of care in this respect and to realise its social responsibility, is to cross-fertilise effective human resource practices, which tend to be substandard in developing nations. Doing so can help not only to safeguard employee well-being, but also reduce turnover rates and protect the home institution from reputational damage, both of which can be costly. It can also support the transition, socialisation and development of staff.\nInitially, managing expectations at the stage of recruitment and selection is important. Many expatriate academics from the Global North may not be aware that an international campus’s operations are distinct from those of the home campus. In fact, they may come to believe that because the international campus ‘belongs’ to the home campus (at least this is how it tends to be marketed), it operates in very similar ways.\nWhen they start their role, they may be surprised and frustrated by the reduced autonomy and close monitoring (even micromanagement) of staff, which may be something they are not typically accustomed to. The international campus therefore needs to be transparent about any differences in operation between the two campuses, while the home campus needs to do more than simply approving hiring decisions and must oversee this process.\nMale academics may be more likely to work abroad and this can impact the organisational culture and potentially lead to a patriarchal culture at the international campus. Effective human resources policies that focus on promoting female representation, such as through suitable maternity or paternity leave provision, as well as suitable family accommodation, can be helpful in facilitating the recruitment and adjustment and support of female academics and their families.\nPower imbalance\nStaff at international campuses tend to perceive the home campus as embodying a top-down and superior position. This can translate into a power imbalance for local academics when co-developing and delivering the curriculum with their home campus academic counterparts. This can undermine local equivalence and promote compliance with, as opposed to enhancement of, quality standards in teaching.\nTo address this, the leadership staff employed by the home campus to work at the international campus and charged with overseeing its academic functioning, can play a vital role in facilitating links between the two campuses. They need to be cognisant of not allying themselves with their employer (ie, the home campus), and instead work to become bilaterally recognised by both campuses.\nProviding greater power to such leaders can also be helpful in allowing them to intervene to resolve problems that may arise at a local level, such as instances of unethical workplace practices.\nAn infrastructure based on shared international services based at the home campus can also be useful in overseeing open communication channels between both campuses. This can also provide an effective mechanism for expressing dissent. For instance, should local academics have an issue at the international campus which cannot be resolved, there should be a way for this to be escalated to the home campus for mediation and resolution.\nParity in facilities and services\nFinally, while the international campus tends to exist primarily to teach students and provide degree certificates from an established Western brand, the home campus needs to be careful that its international campus does not merely become a certificate factory.\nInstead, greater efforts are needed to improve the provision of facilities and services at the international campus (such as academic support, accommodation and recreational facilities), similar to the efforts extended for the home campus, especially as students at the former tend to be paying at least as much, if not more, than students at the latter.\nAlongside teaching, a parallel culture of research needs to be nurtured at the international campus. There is evidence that supporting both a research and student focus can help to foster the success of international campuses.\nDr Nishat Babu is a lecturer (assistant professor) and chartered psychologist based at Loughborough University, United Kingdom. Her research adopts a psychological lens to critically examine the dynamics of (in)effective leadership, and their implications for individual well-being and performance. She also explores how micro-level social responsibility, shaped by individual values and behaviours, can contribute to addressing broader societal challenges.

The EU has a similar agreement with Australia.\nBoth sides have come a long way since April 2024. That was when the EU launched a proposal for a four-year scheme that would give young people such ‘experience’. The UK cried foul: that was freedom of movement.\nThe House of Lords, the research section of the House of Commons, and the energetic German Ambassador to the UK, Miguel Berger, have used their good offices to encourage the more constructive attitude that emerged in the reset talks.\nPoints to sort out\nThere are still important points to sort out. If the YES scheme is to be capped because of UK immigration fears (though one-year schemes don’t count in the statistics), what should the number be? What about the other requirements: a down payment for access to the health service, evidence of resources and no right to bring in dependants? What should the type of visa be?\nThe UK seems less keen on the possibility of an Erasmus+ association, although it was mentioned in the Common Understanding document of the reset, signed off on both sides.\nThomas-Symonds did not even mention the programme in the readout on the talks. For the UK it raises the old Erasmus problem that UK universities lose fee income on incoming students.\nThe European Movement, the body established in the aftermath of the Second World War to promote good relations among the democratic countries of Europe, has made some robust comments on both the YES proposal and a potential Erasmus+ association. They emphasise that the focus in both cases should be on young people who have historically been a minority concern – those from further education.\n“The priority is to engage the plus element of Erasmus+, not the original university-oriented Erasmus,” says Alfred Quantrill, a first-year philosophy student and head of the youth section of the European Movement.\nIt’s not about the hospitality industry\nThe European Movement’s campaign manager Richard Kilpatrick, who has extensive experience in the education sector, says policy thinking must rise above the notion that these young people are merely needed to alleviate the challenges faced by the hospitality industry.\nHe talks of the spark of excitement that the YES scheme and Erasmus+ would generate to propel young people in both directions across the English Channel, saying: “There are the vast opportunities presented by overseas experience in education, training and, in the YES case, work experience, as we know from previous experience and from Erasmus summer schools with themes as diverse as teacher updating and prisoner rehabilitation.”\nHe is sceptical of the HM Treasury and vice-chancellors’ argument that Erasmus+ represents a financial loss. Even when considering a cost-benefit analysis, “it’s a win-win for local areas to have these young people around, and for the young people concerned,” he says.\nThe under-30s eligible for YES or eventually for Erasmus need proof that the UK and EU were not simply spinning when in the reset documents they talked about the mutual need for both sides to develop an ambitious relationship, which “puts people at the centre of the European Union-UK relations”. This is the chance for the UK and the EU to provide it.\nDr Anne Corbett is senior associate at LSE Consulting, London School of Economics and Political Science, United Kingdom. Her 2005 book Universities and the Europe of Knowledge (Palgrave) has a detailed account of how the Erasmus decision was developed and agreed.\nThis article is a commentary.

Learn about ways of embedding sustainability in teaching and learning across the university, in a free webinar with international experts.\nThe experts will explore how individual academics, staff and universities can become agents for sustainable change in the webinar titled “Time to Act: Embedding sustainability in higher education”. The webinar is co-hosted by University World News and ABET, the United States-based but global operating quality assurance and accreditation agency.\nPanelists so far include Professor Fernando Reimers of Harvard University, an expert in education policy, global education and education for sustainability; Dr Debra Rowe, president of the US Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development; and Dr Ratna Lindawati Lubis, a professor at Telkom University in Indonesia and an entrepreneurship education expert.\nModerated by Brendan O’Malley, editor-in-chief of University World News, the experts will explore a range of questions.\nFor instance: How might faculty embed sustainability knowledge and skills into existing curricula and courses, equipping students with awareness of sustainability issues and preparing them with the skills to become sustainability drivers in the future workforce? And how might university leaders and staff advance an institution-wide focus on sustainability through policies, strategies, training and support? What are the good practice examples?\nThe webinar will debate how universities – under increasing pressure to align with global sustainability targets – can act now to embed sustainability as a core institutional value rather than an add-on, and support faculty in their sustainability efforts. The discussion will include insights into balancing global frameworks like the SDGs with local relevance, ensuring that sustainability teaching and learning is meaningful and context-specific.\nAs with all University World News webinars, the aim will be to combine high-level debate with practical guidance. Participants will come away with real-world examples, ideas and approaches that academics can apply directly to their own teaching and curriculum design – whether they’re new to sustainability or already engaging with it in their work.\nThe webinar will be held on Thursday 26 June at: 8.00am LA, 11am NYC, 4pm London, 5pm Cape Town and 8.30pm Delhi.\nREGISTER HERE\nSpeakers\nProfessor Fernando M Reimers is the Ford Foundation Professor of the Practice of International Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he leads the Global Education Innovation Initiative. He is an expert in the field of education policy, global education, and more latterly on aligning curriculum with the SDGs. Aside from many other prestigious appointments, he is an elected member of the National Academy of Education, the International Academy of Education and the Council on Foreign Relations.\nDr Debra Rowe is internationally respected for her work in education and sustainability. She is president of the US Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development, and co-authored the UNEP Global Guidance for Education on Green Jobs. Rowe is a leader of the Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI), a partnership between 10 United Nations entities and the global higher education community, co-chairing two of its action groups – Education for Green Jobs and its SDG Publishers Compact Fellows programme.\nProfessor Ratna Lindawati Lubis is a professor of economics and business at Telkom University in West Java, Indonesia, and a fellow of the SDG Publishers Compact of the United Nations’ Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI).

It is more about the expression of a profound human desire to understand the world we live in, to improve the quality of our lives and to go beyond the status quo.\nHowever, as the world races into the 21st century, we realise that teaching is not solely a matter of acquiring facts. In the world of environmental insecurity, turbulence brought on by new technologies and the threat of nuclear weapons, knowledge alone will not be enough.\nStudents today have inherited a world where the increase in scientific and technological power is progressing faster than our ability to fully understand its long-term implications on humanity and the planet.\nTechnologies that were previously miracle cures of the past – vaccines, computers, putting humankind into space and mapping the human genome – have slowly revealed themselves as double-edged swords. While they bring unprecedented options for advancing society, they also bring fundamental ethical, social and existential questions.\nThe question is not, “What do we know?” but rather, “What do we do with what we know?”\nThis shift to ethical and existential thought rather than just knowledge and skills is the advent of ethical foresight.\nThe most significant outcomes of education are not always academic, although these are very important; they are human. Education should equip learners for work and living within a hyperconnected, uncertain and risk-filled world.\nTo meet this mandate, education systems will have to undergo a fundamental transformation – one that returns wisdom, agency and humanity to the focal point of scientific education.\nFrom knowledge economy to learning society\nFor decades, the knowledge economy drove the world’s education policy. The objective was straightforward: create workers with good technical skills for competitiveness, innovation and development.\nScience education increasingly centres on quantifiable outcomes: better exam results, more STEM graduates and improved research pipelines. These efforts have yielded some undeniable benefits, but they have also highlighted some limitations.\nThis narrow focus on knowledge production, and less interest in ethical foresight, fails to equip students to deal with the ethical impacts of science and technology.\nClimate science, biotechnology and artificial intelligence are not value-neutral subjects. They have a direct role in defining the futures of human society, the environment and even humanity’s very character. Students should not just be able to work in these fields but should be enabled to lead within them, responsibly, ethically and with an awareness of their implications.\nUnless science education becomes more than a passport for a profession, the next generation will be a generation of good technicians without the critical judgment required for responsibly using their skills.\nEthical reasoning is not optional\nEthical reasoning is not something optional or supplementary within a new scientific consciousness. It’s a basic competency.\nWhen students learn genetics, they must grapple with privacy, consent and fairness questions. When they study computer science, they will have to deal with algorithmic bias, surveillance and digital ethics issues. When students study environmental science, they are confronted with questions of justice, sustainability and stewardship for future generations.\nEthical reasoning should not be instructed as a theoretical philosophy, but as a lived practice grounded in actual cases and actual experience, taken from the real world.\nStudents should be encouraged to think of themselves not as passive consumers of scientific knowledge but as active participants in a continuing ethical discussion about the role science plays in shaping the world.\nA deeper scientific consciousness also involves a broader and more honest representation of science. Science isn’t a distinct realm of abstract reason. It’s a profoundly human endeavour, as culture, history, politics and emotion are deeply embedded within it.\nStudents should understand that science always exists within human meaning and power relations. It expresses human values and biases as much as objective facts about the physical world.\nThis calls for a more inclusive and questioning science curriculum that acknowledges the work of Indigenous knowledge traditions, female scientists, scientists from the Global South and marginalised voices that have been traditionally excluded from the scientific mainstream.\nScience should not be a monolithic subject, but should be presented as a rich, dynamic conversation of many perspectives.\nPlanetary stewardship and global interdependence\nThe paramount challenges of our time (climate change, pandemics, food insecurity and mass migration) are transnational and require global solutions.\nScience education should thus impart a global awareness to students. Students must learn how scientific activities in one corner of the globe impact lives and ecosystems everywhere. They must learn to look beyond national interests and short-term gains and adopt a sense of planetary stewardship.\nPractically, this would mean integrating global case studies into the curriculum, increasing cross- border scientific cooperation and teaching students that scientific literacy involves more than reading a graph or designing experiments, but making ethical choices.\nThe most significant challenge of developing a new scientific consciousness is accepting uncertainty. Science does not have all the answers. Technology cannot eliminate all risks. Students must be prepared for a world where perfect solutions are rare, compromises are unavoidable and improvement occurs in a non-linear manner.\nThey need to build the resilience to deal with complexity, the courage to confront ambiguity and the humility to acknowledge when answers are incomplete. This requires a pedagogy that focuses on questioning, conversation, reflection and doing.\nIt encourages educators to provide space for students to grapple candidly with big questions, in a setting where scepticism isn’t punished, but rather admired as a necessary part of the educational process.\nIt demands a new definition of success: the ability to make thoughtful, ethical decisions about things under conditions of uncertainty.\nA genuinely progressive education\nThere comes a point where science education must be more than a gateway to economic development; it must also be a melting pot for human development.\nA genuinely progressive science education will foster the acquisition of professional competence and ethical reasoning. It will portray science as a human, cultural and ethical activity. It will create a sense of global consciousness and collective responsibility. It will enable students to face uncertainty with resilience, humility and integrity.\nOur world’s future, our communities’ future and our shared humanity are not determined by what they know, but by who they shall be because of what they know.\nIf we can achieve this new scientific consciousness, education will have fulfilled its ultimate role: not merely disseminating knowledge, but disseminating wisdom; not only training professionals, but educating human beings who can lead with vision, compassion and courage in an uncertain future.\nPatrick Blessinger is president and chief scientist for the International Higher Education Teaching and Learning (HETL) Association in the United States.

The vibrancy of American research, teaching, and innovation relies on this intricate network of global ideas and relationships.\nAt Harvard, international students and scholars are not an incidental aspect of our campus; they are central to our mission.\nA long tradition\nOur identity as a global university was shaped by Charles William Eliot, Harvard’s transformative 21st president, who looked abroad for wisdom, travelling to France and Germany to study the role of higher education in economic development, and returned imbued with the conviction that relevance in education could only be achieved through international engagement.\nUpon return from this trip, he published an article on the role that universities should play to promote economic development, which caught the attention of the Harvard Corporation. He was subsequently appointed president of the university.\nUnder his leadership, Harvard ceased to be a provincial college and emerged as a beacon of cosmopolitan learning – one that would draw faculty and students from all continents and considerably expand graduate research programmes and professional education in order to become more relevant to the needs of society.\nThis tradition continues today.\nThe global makeup of Harvard’s campus provides an unparalleled intellectual environment: students and faculty exchange ideas, challenge worldviews, and broaden both scholarly and ethical horizons. The lifelong bonds formed here lay the foundation for future professional collaborations and breakthroughs.\nTo cut off this flow – to imagine a Harvard or an American university whose campus is limited to those carrying only one nation’s passport – is to relegate ourselves to irrelevance not only in the classroom but in the world’s bigger conversation about how to improve the human condition.\nAutonomy, a prerequisite for democracy\nLet us be clear: the move to bar international student and scholar participation is not rooted in the law, nor in any defensible rationale of national interest.\nIt is an act of reprisal driven by a desire to punish institutions that refuse to bend to political overreach – universities that challenge autocratic attempts to control who belongs in our classrooms, what is taught, and who may teach.\nFor Harvard and our peers, acquiescence would mean the loss of autonomy essential for free inquiry – a prerequisite for democracy itself.\nThe consequences of such policies ripple well beyond our gates. International students and scholars are vital not only to Harvard’s teaching and research but to the very fabric of American higher education.\nIn the sciences, mathematics, and engineering, they comprise about half of all graduate students and postdoctoral researchers; foreign-born inventors account for over half the patents awarded at leading United States universities.\nAmerican innovation – including Nobel-class and entrepreneurial contributions – brings together the world’s brightest minds. This is not accidental; it is the direct result of a system open to the world’s talent, perspectives, and ambitions.\nMoreover, our global students and alumni magnify Harvard’s purpose far beyond our campus. Many return home to lead, teach, and serve, taking with them values rooted in inquiry, dialogue, and shared humanity.\nThey strengthen global networks that aspire to justice, evidence-based policymaking, and peaceful cooperation. To shut down these exchanges is to diminish both America and the planet’s capacity to meet its gravest challenges.\nThis latest episode also reveals a sobering vulnerability. Even storied institutions like Harvard, which have weathered centuries, are not immune to political whim or ideological pressure.\nAutonomy and openness – pillars of American academic excellence – can be quickly undermined if we do not collectively defend them.\nThe future of a free, democratic society depends on universities’ ability to remain independent, to select their faculty, shape their curricula, and open their doors to all who can contribute, regardless of nation of origin.\nDo such policies have a chilling effect on academic freedom and institutional courage?\nParadoxically, though intended to instil fear and limit voice, these attacks have instead sparked widespread resistance and mobilised allies across academia and society.\nThe academic community, students, and civil society have begun to challenge these intrusions, seeking legal recourse and raising awareness of what is at stake.\nHow must universities respond?\nLooking forward, how must universities respond?\nFirst, we must reiterate and defend the principle that our autonomy is fundamental – not as a privilege, but as the cornerstone of democracy and social progress.\nSecond, we must educate and mobilise the public, lawmakers, and courts to resist political attempts to curtail global academic collaboration and to protect institutional independence.\nLegal challenges, principled advocacy, and transparent dialogue with policymakers are all necessary. Universities must never barter their global mission and integrity for short-term compliance.\nFinally, we must recognise that global engagement is not an ancillary value or an administrative preference – it is the engine of innovation and understanding. Harvard, and American higher education more generally, must continue to draw students and scholars from every country.\nThis diversity keeps our ideas vibrant, our research relevant, and our societies prepared for a common purpose.\nIn closing, I urge everyone – citizens, legislators, journalists – not only to resist the effort to estrange the world’s students and scholars from our universities but to reaffirm the foundational truth: education’s highest purpose is realised only through openness and collaboration.\nTo retreat now into isolation is to undo decades of steady, transformative progress. Harvard survived its provincial era once; to revert would be a tragedy not only for this institution or country but for humanity as a whole.\nLet us take this moment of risk to renew our commitment to the internationalisation of higher education – not just for Harvard’s sake, but for the world we all share and the future we all shape together.\nFernando M Reimers is the Ford Foundation Professor of the Practice of International Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he leads the Global Education Innovation Initiative and chairs the Global, International and Comparative Education Concentration in the masters programme.

As the Department of Homeland Security declared: “Harvard can no longer enrol foreign students, and existing foreign students must transfer or lose their legal status.”\nThis move, part of a broader pattern of Trump-era interventions, exemplifies a troubling trend: states increasingly assert control over global academic mobility.\nHigher education in an era of nationalist backlash\nWhile this case is rooted in US politics, it reflects a global phenomenon. The rise of right-wing populism and neo-nationalism worldwide is putting higher education, especially its ‘international’ dimensions, under growing pressure.\nAcross continents, international students and scholars face visa denials, detentions or severe restrictions. Institutions sever global partnerships, especially with geopolitical rivals, or relocate entirely, as seen in the forced move of Central European University from Hungary to Austria.\nThese developments are not mere bureaucratic glitches but signal a deeper reassertion of nation-state power over knowledge production, mobility and collaboration.\nMany in academia respond with concern, defending academic freedom and global engagement, as Harvey Charles and Anthony Ogden did recently in their article in University World News.\nOthers, like internationalisation expert John K Hudzik, propose pragmatic strategies, urging universities to demonstrate the relevance of internationalisation through intentional, integrated and outcomes-driven approaches that prioritise quality, civic engagement and global relevance, hoping this will create space to remain globally connected.\nThese responses, while necessary, also prompt a more fundamental question: What do we mean when we say ‘international’ or ‘internationalisation’? What worldviews underpin these concepts?\nThe invisible framework: Nation-state thinking\nThe answer lies in a nation-state ontology – a foundational assumption that the world is divided into discrete, bounded national units. Internationalisation thus becomes the space between these units, reinforcing rather than challenging the idea of fixed national borders.\nThis ontology becomes built into our identity, our institutions and into the identities that we as educators foster in others.\nWe see ourselves first and foremost in terms of national identity and focus on national interest, not mutual interest. Internationalisation thus becomes self-centred and self-enclosed, something that concerns our own practices, values and political-economic goals alone, rather than building a shared global space in which we engage deeply and learn through both similarity and difference, while acknowledging our power differences.\nThe word ‘international’ itself reveals this legacy. Coined by Jeremy Bentham in 1780, it described laws governing relations between sovereign states.\nBentham’s ‘international’ was intended to clarify the “law of nations” by focusing on interactions between distinct, self-contained political entities. Originating from a European legal framework, the term inherently assumes a world partitioned by sovereign borders.\nGiven this history, it is unsurprising that an ‘international student’ is defined not by transnational identity or experience but by citizenship status and immigration policy. The global, it seems, always appears within the grammar of the national containers.\nIt becomes impossible to imagine the world as a whole, the world as a single political subject with its own interests, an interdependent world, with a common ecology and a shared human (and non-human) planet.\nFrom the national container, the world appears only as a space to be fought over by nation-states, as a resource to be divided up and exploited, and as the target of violence and war.\nWar between and within nations (Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Gaza, Sudan…) is not an accident or an exceptional pathology. It is fundamental to the nation-state project.\nBecause that project is an artificial one, it has often been instituted by violence – and once national assertion spills over into military conflict, the nation-bound kind of international education is one of the casualties.\nThe ‘Velcro’ of internationalisation\nThe ‘nation-state ontology’ acts as the invisible framework underpinning internationalisation. It’s the ‘Velcro’ sticking to nearly every aspect of global higher education, from university branding and rankings to mobility programmes, yet it often goes unquestioned.\nEven well-meaning initiatives, like regional exchange schemes or global competency programmes, reinforce national entities as the core unit of difference.\nThis logic is starkly evident in the treatment of international students: frequently seen as temporary economic assets rather than integral members of academic communities or people with rights.\nIn the US, recent crackdowns – exemplified by the Harvard case – expose how foreign students have become proxies in broader political battles over sovereignty, immigration and national identity; not only forced to conform to US policy but also snatched off the street and detained without limit, performatively sacrificed in a display of ‘Make America Great Again’.\nRethinking the frame\nWhy does this matter? Because the persistence of nation-state frameworks limits our ability to envision more just, flexible and relational forms of global education. In a world facing planetary challenges such as climate change, pandemics and technological disruption, thinking globally through national lenses feels increasingly inadequate, if not counterproductive.\nYet the nation-state’s grip tightens: visa systems become more restrictive, partnerships face geopolitical scrutiny and universities prioritise national compliance over global principles – not out of malice, but institutional necessity.\nMeanwhile, internationalisation is often depoliticised, marketed as a neutral or benevolent force while quietly reproducing inequalities tied to citizenship, economics and colonial histories.\nSo, what would it mean to internationalise beyond the nation-state?\nOne possibility is shifting the focus from national affiliation to relational belonging. Instead of treating students and scholars as state-linked assets, we could centre ethical connection, mutual care, learning from each other and decolonial solidarity.\nGlobal education would then be measured not merely by mobility or prestige but by the depth and equity of the relationships it fosters.\nThis shift demands more than new tactics; it requires ontological reflexivity – interrogating the frameworks we take for granted and loosening the nation-state’s compulsive grip.\nThe stakes for global higher education\nIf internationalisation remains tethered to the nation-state, it risks becoming an empty project – glossing over global aspirations without systemic change. To be truly global, higher education must confront its complicity in national agendas, colonial legacies and wars, past and present, imagining more expansive and inclusive models of engagement.\nThis moment – marked by geopolitical tensions and the rapidly accumulating climate crisis – is also an opportunity. It calls us not only to defend internationalisation but to reimagine it: not as a tool for national advantage but as a commitment to shared futures.\nWhat kind of world are we building through education – and for whom?\nRiyad A Shahjahan is professor of higher, adult and lifelong education at Michigan State University in the United States.

What are the implications for academic practice? Why is this work important, and how can we support it?\nGaza’s universities have faced huge challenges in continuing to offer some form of higher education to nearly 100,000 students since the start of Israel’s ongoing war on the Gaza Strip. Their struggles and how we look to rebuild in the future are of relevance to educational leadership in other conflict-affected areas.\nUniversity leadership typically involves structured risk management and problem solving – negotiating budget constraints, faculty shortages, accreditation hurdles, policy changes, adapting to technological advances (such as remote learning) and responding to crises such as pandemics.\nEducational leadership at Gaza’s universities has had to deal with all of these, as well as operate under conditions of occupation and prolonged siege for the last 17 years.\nSince October 2023, however, higher education in the Gaza Strip has faced unprecedented challenges that have threatened its very existence.\nAlmost all of Gaza’s universities have been destroyed, completely or partially, leading to the loss of essential infrastructure, decades of hard work and investment, and academic, technical and financial resources, as well as disruption to teaching, learning and graduation for tens of thousands of students and the livelihoods of academic and administrative employees.\nMore than 97 academics have been killed in Gaza, including three university presidents and nine college deans.\nBoth staff and students who remain in Gaza continue to suffer from indiscriminate killings, from the possibility of life-changing injuries, multiple instances of displacement and other experiences of loss, fear, humiliation, disease, thirst and starvation; those who left Gaza are separated from their loved ones, mourning what they left behind while grappling with an uncertain future.\nPermanent crisis mode\nThe current challenges that Gaza’s educational leadership is facing have gone far beyond problem-solving – they have become existential and permanent, necessitating a shift to survival management.\nGaza university leaders are continuously asking: “Is this lecturer still alive?”; “Is there electricity or internet to deliver teaching?”; “Can students enrolled on this course remain in one fixed place long enough to complete a module, or are they on the move?”; “After losing her hands, is she still able to type, to organise, to hold the system together?”; “Can starved students sit exams?”\nThese survival issues are not the same as administrative logistics. They don’t just slow or hinder higher education; they reset any progress made.\nAt a conference at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in April 2025, Dr Raed Al Hajjar – the Al-Aqsa University vice-president for academic affairs in Gaza, who, after leaving Gaza due to the war, is directing academic processes for his university from abroad – compared their efforts to maintain teaching and learning processes to someone rowing through the sea while desperately trying to grasp at a piece of string in the water; each time he grabs for it, it slips into the water, and he keeps searching for it, again and again.\nAl Hajjar also explained that lecturers are facing huge and ongoing difficulty in maintaining any online connection with students in Gaza. Instructors often find themselves repeatedly asking during class: “Do you hear me? Do you hear me?” They hope for signs of connection yet often hear a reply from just one student, if any.\nHe likened the experience to someone who is calling out to a person who is trapped in a well, a metaphor that indicates the isolation and helplessness of students in Gaza.\nThe metaphor also speaks to the problems for educational leaders who work to support these students living in permanent crisis mode, which include stress, exhaustion, mental overload, grief, loss and additional time and effort that may not be required by typical educational leaders at universities around the world.\nMany of Gaza’s university leaders remain in the Gaza Strip, trying to lead. Like students, they worry about their immediate safety and survival needs, live in tents, eat one meal a day and queue for hours to fetch some water on a daily basis.\nGaza’s universities are also suffering from a substantial financial crisis, particularly since they rely heavily on tuition fees to fund their operational costs and staff salaries, as well as their pensions.\nThis puts extreme pressure on leaders and staff, particularly since they and their families may not be able to afford the skyrocketing prices of essential goods in Gaza, if any are available at all as a result of the prolonged Gaza border closures by Israel and the destruction of livelihoods and community assets in the coastal enclave.\nIt is in this context and amid these extreme conditions that Gaza’s universities are continuing to operate to offer higher education to students in Gaza. But this context makes superficial and instrumentalist approaches to teaching and learning the norm because expecting quality higher education at this critical time has become an unattainable luxury or even irrational idealism.\nResisting erasure of higher education\nWhile working to support higher education in Gaza might be perceived by many around the world as a matter of human rights, social justice and wider global development, for Palestinians it carries additional layers of urgency, including a national responsibility to resist the erasure of their past and present and to build a future for a new generation.\nIn fact, Palestinians’ dedication to their education and to higher education against all odds is a historical legacy. For example, during the first Intifada (1987 to 1990), Israel’s punitive measures against Palestinian schools and universities intensified. This included killings, injuries, expulsions, harassment and arbitrary closures of university campuses.\nIn my research on higher education at Gaza’s universities, one academic interviewee recalled how her “biology teacher took many of the teacher’s tools, including live cells, to her home”, which she turned into a small university space to continue teaching her students despite the university’s closure.\nMary W Gray (1990) also explains that during the Intifada, Palestinians continued to hold educational meetings with “the meeting place, maybe the home of the faculty member or a student, the back room of a shop, or even an automobile. A day may include several classes in widely separated locations, to which many faculty members will walk or catch buses or share taxis”.\nSimilarly, in their open letter to Al Jazeera in May 2024, the Emergency Committee of Universities in Gaza wrote: “We have come together as Palestinian academics and staff of Gaza universities to affirm our existence, the existence of our colleagues and our students, and the insistence on our future, in the face of all current attempts to erase us …\n“We issue this call from beneath the bombs of the occupation forces across occupied Gaza, in the refugee camps of Rafah, and from the sites of temporary new exile in Egypt and other host countries.”\nEducational leadership in Gaza and conflict zones can be a crucial frontline form of civic defence against aggression and ethnic cleansing.\nDocumenting and archiving as much as possible of the acts of leadership (lessons, decisions, challenges, adaptations and innovations) may be helpful when it comes to empowering educational resistance more generally, as well as challenging the stereotypical and neutral perception of learning, particularly in a war that was declared by the International Court of Justice on 26 January 2024 to be, plausibly, a genocide.\nBut it is important not to idealise the current educational leadership of Gaza’s universities and their capacity to respond collectively. My research has shown that even prior to Israel’s war on Gaza, there were limitations on leadership, and reform was required in several aspects (for example, in terms of representation, gender distribution, bureaucratic style, lack of collaboration and other areas).\nStudents’ motivation and determination to learn is a key driver of the continuation of such efforts, as is support from the Gaza community, the Palestinian diaspora and other regional and international solidarity initiatives.\nPost-war reconstruction\nThe unprecedented challenges facing higher education in Gaza today, and later after the war ends, cannot be addressed by Gaza universities’ leadership alone, nor by conventional methods.\nThere is a need to empower educational leadership in Gaza and other conflict-affected areas to strengthen their ability to mitigate some of the challenges of widespread local collapse.\nThis includes supporting Gaza’s universities through global solidarity, sharing of expertise, funds and resources, and the establishment of twin systems with institutions, which may also involve diaspora scholars, to provide temporary relief and help higher education to continue. For other ways of supporting Gaza universities, see my policy brief here.\nLessons learnt from the experiences of educational leaders in this war should inform post-war reconstruction of Gaza’s universities. Some recommendations include:\n• Decentralising educational infrastructure (for example, through modular curricula, mobile teaching kits and peer educators and distributing leadership both across the institution and in terms of geographical areas and specialisation as the result of the collapse of a formal hierarchy).\n• Investing in offline-first learning tools (portable servers and low-tech back-ups).\n• Enhancing collaborations and teaching across different institutions in terms of expertise and resources.\n• Empowering sector leadership (for example, pre-coordination of emergency leadership through the Ministry of Higher Education and trusted non-governmental organisations in Gaza, the West Bank, and the Palestinian diaspora.\n• Investing in mobile learning centres and digital hubs.\n• Offering training in adaptive leadership and in risk and emergency management.\n• Establishing working relationships between higher education leaders and leaders of other humanitarian organisations operating in the Gaza Strip, exploring ways to offer mutual support at times of war and crisis.\n• Offering psycho-social and moral support to educational leaders across Gaza’s universities to strengthen their resilience and ability to endure, self-heal and support others during difficult times.\nIn their open letter to Al Jazeera, academics and staff from Gaza’s universities say: “Education is not just a means of imparting knowledge; it is a vital pillar of our existence and a beacon of hope for the Palestinian people.”\nDespite commendable efforts to close the gaps in higher educational offerings to students in Gaza, as Israel’s war on the Gaza Strip continues, the efforts of educators are being constantly undermined, keeping them in a loop, circling the void, which gets larger every day.\nDr Mona Jebril is a research associate at the University of Cambridge’s Centre for Business Research and a Bye-Fellow in education and academic development at Queens’ College, University of Cambridge.

This single act underscored how geopolitical distrust now directly affects academic lives and partnerships.\nDemographic trends\nInternational student flows remain robust but are more unevenly distributed. Jinlian Zheng of the Center for China and Globalization in China presented data showing that international enrolment has surpassed 6.8 million globally, with middle-income countries such as India and China supplying the majority of outbound students.\nThese demographic trends reflect both the democratisation of overseas education and the heightened role of education in upward social mobility. However, host countries are now enacting targeted controls.\nChristopher Ziguras from the Centre for the Study of Higher Education at the University of Melbourne, Australia, revealed how Australia and Canada, previously liberal international education markets, have shifted to experimental governance models.\nThese include fee levies, enrolment caps by institution and programme and cohort-based controls that attempt to better distribute international students across geographies and sectors.\nHousing provision, strategic partner preferences, and even regional development objectives are now influencing admissions policies. The goal, he argues, is no longer just economic return but managing population growth, ensuring housing availability and supporting social cohesion.\nThis shift from open systems to “managed trade” is profoundly altering the dynamics of international higher education, particularly for students from low- and middle-income nations whose mobility aspirations are now increasingly shaped by political calculus rather than personal choice.\nGovernments are balancing diplomatic relations, labour market needs and public opinion, creating a more volatile and unpredictable environment for universities.\nThe United States in particular is seeing growing visa restrictions and institutional mistrust. Several speakers described this as part of a “chilling effect” discouraging Chinese students from applying or continuing their studies at US institutions.\nOther speakers emphasised the enduring role of academic diplomacy and people-to-people exchanges in an era of geopolitical turbulence.\nHongxia Wei, chief senior fellow of the Academy of Contemporary China and World Studies (ACCWS), argued for the proactive safeguarding of US-China educational ties through diversified pathways and innovation in bilateral cooperation.\nSimilarly, Qian Xiao from the Office of International Affairs at Tsinghua University presented Tsinghua’s evolving strategies to sustain global engagement, emphasising cross-regional alliances and interdisciplinary capacity-building.\nJin Liu of the School of Education at Beijing Institute of Technology contributed a complementary perspective by tracing the shifting global mobility patterns of Chinese diaspora scholars, highlighting how national talent strategies and diasporic networks are increasingly intertwined with institutional internationalisation agendas.\n‘Space-making’ in research collaborations\nWen Wen of the School of Education at Tsinghua University introduced a powerful theoretical lens: international collaboration in higher education as ‘space-making’ under geopolitical constraints.\nHer framework shows how China is repositioning its international research ties from a liberal, West-centric model toward multi-polar, state-aligned strategies. Rather than retreating, China is making new spaces – collaborating with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the African Union, and Belt and Road countries through state-organised platforms and big science initiatives.\nThis is not a withdrawal from global science, but a strategic recalibration. Wen’s argument – building on Henri Lefebvre and Simon Marginson’s work – positions space-making as an active reconfiguration of material, symbolic and institutional terrain.\nRankings, branch campuses, international research centres and MOOCs become instruments in an evolving geopolitical geography of knowledge. China’s efforts to construct academic alliances with the Global South are part of a long-term plan to rebalance global scientific influence.\nTransnational education\nThe session on transnational higher education, led by Kun Dai from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and others, drew attention to the rapid growth of joint programmes, intra-country campuses and dual-degree arrangements.\nDai mapped the contours of transnational higher education across China, emphasising the diversity of student motivations – from lowering cost barriers to enhancing global employability – and the uneven quality of experiences.\nCase studies highlighted both the opportunities for intercultural learning and the difficulties of adaptation, including language barriers and institutional misalignment.\nFutao Huang from Hiroshima University focused on the success and failure of global university expansions.\nCase studies such as Temple University Japan, Nottingham Malaysia and the now-closed Yale-NUS College illustrate that success is determined not just by enrolments or finances, but by three interrelated dimensions: institutional alignment, cultural congruence and policy-operational flexibility. These factors affect long-term viability and stakeholder legitimacy.\nThis was echoed by Chen Huirong of the Research Centre for Higher Education at Northwestern Polytechnical University, who conducted a study applying principal-agent theory to show how overlapping authority across multiple national systems introduces governance risks in international branch campuses.\nThe research shows that unclear mandates, conflicting accountability structures and regulatory asymmetries can lead to strategic drift and operational failure.\nOne exemplary case is Xiamen University Malaysia (XMUM), presented by Ying Zhang, the vice-president of Xiamen University Malaysia, which was highlighted as a flagship of sustainable Chinese internationalisation.\nWith government support from both China and Malaysia, XMUM has cultivated strong regional integration, high research output and effective talent pipelines aligned with the Belt and Road vision.\nIts success demonstrates how cultural reciprocity and institutional adaptability can be harmonised. Ying Zhang also emphasised the role of institutional support and regional partnerships in ensuring long-term sustainability.\nJoint venture universities\nDenis Simon, former executive vice-chancellor of Duke Kunshan University, offered one of the most sobering analyses of the conference. Drawing on the experience of joint venture universities such as DKU, he argued that these institutions now operate under increasing legal and political uncertainty.\nSimon noted that the expansion of national security laws, ideological scrutiny and US bipartisan scepticism about China have created a chilling effect. Several past joint venture efforts (for instance, Georgia Tech-Tianjin and the University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiao Tong University Joint Institute) have faltered or closed, while current ventures are experiencing growing “dual accountability” dilemmas.\nFaculty self-censorship, student disengagement around sensitive topics and compliance with contradictory regulatory regimes are becoming common.\nHe also pointed to the growing pressure on US universities to reevaluate their foreign partnerships. Congressional scrutiny, concerns over data privacy and media coverage have created a climate of suspicion. These tensions place joint venture administrators and faculty in difficult positions, often forcing them to navigate incompatible regulatory and cultural expectations.\nSimon suggested that future joint venture models must include clearer red lines and “road maps” to indicate acceptable research domains and governance practices. Areas such as AI and quantum computing may remain off-limits, but there is still room for collaboration in climate change, health science and social research.\nDespite these challenges, Simon remains a cautious optimist. He emphasised that joint ventures still play a critical role in building trust between societies, developing cross-border talent and offering alternatives to zero-sum narratives.\nThe question he posed is not whether joint ventures should continue, but how they can evolve to survive in a climate of declining trust and intensifying rivalry. New models of governance, shared values and clearer legal frameworks are urgently needed.\nThese discussions underscore not only the institutional and geopolitical complexity of internationalisation but also the urgent need to articulate a principled vision for its future trajectory.\nA new compact\nThe Tsinghua conference demonstrated that the internationalisation of higher education is undergoing a fundamental transformation. It must now be strategic, aligning closely with national priorities while embracing global responsibilities; inclusive, extending opportunities to under-represented regions and institutions; and governance-focused, with resilient, transparent mechanisms for regulation and accountability.\nCrucially, it must also be ethically grounded and purpose-driven, rejecting commercial excess and contributing to a more just and sustainable world.\nIn this context, institutions must avoid overdependence on any single geopolitical bloc and instead foster diversified and mutually respectful collaborations that reflect shared global challenges.\nInternationalisation today is no longer merely about crossing borders. It is about why and how we cross them. The future lies not in numbers but in values, not in reach but in relevance. What is needed is a renewed compact – one that recognises the power of higher education not only to connect the world but to help transform and heal it.\nFutao Huang is a professor at the Research Institute for Higher Education, Hiroshima University, Japan. Wen Wen is vice dean and professor at the School of Education, Tsinghua University. China. Qian Xiao is dean of the Office of International Affairs, Tsinghua University, China.\nThe Tsinghua Education Salon was held on 24 May 2025 and organised by the School of Education and the Office of International Affairs at Tsinghua University.

Liverpool is the second foreign university, after the UK’s Southampton University, to be issued a LoI under the regulations of the University Grants Commission (UGC) relating to the establishment of foreign universities in India.\nSouthampton began academic courses this year at its Gurugram campus in Haryana state.\nPradhan noted: “The University of Liverpool is the fourth foreign university to publicly announce its presence in India. By this academic year, 15 foreign universities will be coming to India, especially in STEM [science, technology, engineering and mathematics].”\nOthers are Australia’s Deakin and Wollongong universities in Ahmedabad’s GIFT City in Gujarat, and the UK’s York University in Mumbai, as well as Southampton University.\nThe UGC, the country’s higher education regulator, confirmed several international institutions were in advanced stages of setting up campuses.\nAccording to the Association of Indian Universities (AIU), which represents more than 1,000 universities in India, new foreign campuses present a “remarkable opportunity”, as about one to 1.2 million Indian students are currently pursuing education abroad.\nAIU Secretary General Pankaj Mittal told University World News: “Many foreign universities charge higher tuition fees for international students, but studying in India can alleviate this financial burden and, by remaining in India, students can sidestep the high living costs often associated with studying overseas, thus making quality education more accessible and affordable.”\n“This setup can provide students with a cost-effective way to access international education while enjoying the benefits of living in their home country,” Mittal said.\nCampus in Bengaluru\nThe University of Liverpool, one of the UK’s leading research-intensive institutions, received formal approval from the UGC to open a campus in Bengaluru (Bangalore), the capital of the southern state of Karnataka, which is a major technology industry hub and home to the headquarters of global Indian tech companies such as Infosys, CISCO, and Wipro, as well as a major centre for Google and Microsoft.\nLiverpool is also the first foreign university campus in Bengaluru. While London’s prestigious Imperial College in April announced it is establishing an innovation hub in Bengaluru, this will not be a teaching campus.\nLiverpool already has experience of operating a campus in Asia, having set up its first foreign campus in 2006 in China in partnership with Xi’an Jiaotong University. Known as Liverpool Xi’an Jaiotong University, it is situated in China’s east coast town of Suzhou in Jiangsu province.\nAmong other universities set to begin operations between 2026 and 2027, two are from Australia and one each from the US and Italy.\nAustralia’s Western Sydney University (WSU) will set up in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, close to New Delhi, for its first Indian campus and has applied for UGC permission to set up others in Mumbai and elsewhere in the country.\nWSU also has experience of operating campuses abroad, having opened a new branch campus in Surabaya, Indonesia, last September. WSU is recognised for its leadership in innovation and technology education.\nAnother Australian university with plans to set up in India, Victoria University, has not thus far revealed the location of its branch campus; it has said it plans to introduce flexible learning models tailored to local needs, with a strong emphasis on practical education in business, IT, and hospitality.\nChicago-based Illinois Institute of Technology (Illinois Tech) will be the first US university to open a physical campus in India, in Mumbai, leveraging its strengths in engineering, technology, and applied sciences.\nThe proposed new campus is part of Illinois Tech’s push into Asia, with approval by China’s Education Ministry this month to set up the Illinois College of Engineering in China, in partnership with the Beijing Information Science and Technology University.\nThe Istituto Europeo di Design (IED) from Italy is renowned for its excellence in fashion, design, and visual communication, with multiple campuses in Italy, including Rome, Milan, Turin and Venice, as well as campuses in Spain and Brazil.\nIED said it now aims to bring its European creative heritage to a campus in India, offering aspiring designers access to global expertise.\nGlobal exchange opportunities\nScheduled to welcome its inaugural cohort of undergraduate and postgraduate students in August 2026, Liverpool will initially offer programmes in business management, accounting and finance, computer science, and biomedical sciences.\nNotably, it will also introduce a programme in game design – a unique offering for a UK university campus in India. It will also provide UK-based students with exchange opportunities to India.\n“The Indian government’s ambition to significantly increase enrolment in higher education is visionary, and we are excited to be developing plans to play our part.\n“Opening a campus in the State of Karnataka and [city of] Bengaluru feels like the next natural step, building on the fantastic partnerships and collaborations we already enjoy there,” said Liverpool Vice-Chancellor Tim Jones.\nAccording to the Education Ministry, the Bengaluru campus will create a research-intensive environment, with important fundamental, applied and industry-driven research based on the Bengaluru campus, “providing solutions to a range of global and local challenges and needs”.\nIndia as a ‘trusted partner’\nPradhan said this week the Liverpool LoI “reaffirms India's emergence as a trusted partner in global higher education”.\nHowever, even as more foreign universities are entering India to promote academic collaboration and knowledge exchange, several prominent Indian universities are opting to cut ties with institutions in countries like Turkey, Pakistan, and Bangladesh.\nThese nations are perceived as politically hostile to India after they openly supported Pakistan in last month’s military attacks on each other’s territory in the wake of the 22 April terrorist attack on mainly Indian tourists visiting Pahalgam in Indian-administered Kashmir.\nThe AIU also encouraged Indian higher education institutions to end academic partnerships with universities in these countries. In a letter dated 15 May, the AIU highlighted the support Bangladesh and Turkey provided to Pakistan as the rationale behind the move.\nSeveral universities, including Delhi’s prestigious Jawaharlal Nehru University, and several Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), including IIT Roorkee and IIT Bombay, cancelled or, as in the case of Delhi University, said they were reconsidering their collaborative agreements with universities in Turkey.\nConcerns have been voiced privately by Indian academics that such politically motivated actions could compromise the credibility and autonomy of Indian universities and could lead to Indian institutions being perceived as unreliable global partners, susceptible to sudden policy shifts driven by geopolitical tensions.\nThis could deter some foreign universities from establishing campuses in India, they noted.\nThe AIU’s Mittal stressed the importance of academic institutions refraining from engaging with nations perceived as “hostile” to India. “AIU is concerned about the ties between Indian institutions and their Turkish counterparts due to Turkey's stance on Pakistan,” she said.\nNational interests\n“Given the current geopolitical situation, we believe that national interests should take precedence. We’ve written to universities, requesting that they reconsider their partnerships with Turkish institutions if they perceive Turkey's actions as unfriendly towards India.\n“The letter asks them to evaluate their relationships and potentially sever ties with Turkish universities if deemed necessary,” she noted.\nMittal, however, stressed that this is an appeal rather than a mandate. “AIU doesn't have the authority to make it obligatory for universities to snap ties with Turkish institutions.\nNonetheless, in the national interest, AIU is appealing to them to consider this matter and take action if they deem it appropriate,” she said.\nMittal said: “Unlike regulatory bodies like the UGC, which can enforce mandates, our role is to facilitate and appeal to universities to make their own decisions regarding their international partnerships.”\nUWN Asia Editor Yojana Sharma contributed to this article\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The multipolar world now taking shape may offer new room for manoeuvre but, unless the continent’s states and institutions cultivate the strategic capacity to navigate it, this opening could become another missed opportunity.\nThis was the stark message delivered by Professor Adam Habib on Africa Day, 25 May 2025. He was the keynote speaker at Africa Week 2025, a biennial science leadership summit hosted by the Future Africa platform of the University of Pretoria (UP) in South Africa.\nFuture Africa is a pan-African research and convening hub. The summit was supported by South Africa’s Department of Science, Technology and Innovation (DSTI), as well as the country’s National Research Foundation (NRF).\nA seasoned political scientist and higher education leader, Habib is currently vice-chancellor of SOAS (School of Oriental and African Science) University of London. He previously served as vice-chancellor of the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits), deputy vice-chancellor for research at the University of Johannesburg (UJ), and professor of development studies at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN). A co-founder of the African Research Universities Alliance (ARUA), he is widely recognised for his contributions to academic freedom, university transformation and science policy.\nThe world to come\nIn an address that combined sobering analysis with an urgent call to action, Habib challenged African leaders – including those in higher education – to confront the continent’s fragilities with pragmatic resolve.\n“Africa is hopelessly out of its depth,” he said, referencing the continent’s faltering diplomatic capacity, governance failures and squandered economic leverage. But he also outlined a pathway towards relevance and agency: deepen integration through the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), professionalise public administration, and elevate excellence as a guiding value.\nHabib warned that we are living in a period of global volatility, fractured alliances and weakened multilateral institutions.\nYet, he stressed, “Africa’s collapse is not inevitable.” The continent can shape “the world that is yet to come”, but only if it develops the political will and institutional strength to do so.\nFrom rhetoric to agency\nHabib’s keynote examined South Africa and Africa’s place in a reconfiguring global order. He described a world in which American hegemony is in retreat, China is leveraging trade and diplomacy to reshape norms, and Europe is caught between ambition and hesitancy. In this context, he argued, African countries could increase their strategic relevance – but only if they develop the necessary capabilities.\nStrategic autonomy, he argued, must move beyond rhetoric. It is not merely about choosing non-alignment or balancing relationships. It requires leverage, competence and agility. India has its massive internal market; Brazil its scale and political influence in South America. Even Ireland, though small, has used its EU position effectively. Africa, by contrast, lacks the cohesion, institutional capacity and integrated markets needed to turn potential into power.\nHabib’s diagnosis was especially pointed when it came to governance and diplomacy. South Africa’s embassies, he said, are so hollowed out by political appointments that many could close with “minimal impact”. The continent’s mineral wealth has enriched elites but not served development. “We have squandered our political cache,” he said, and the erosion of bureaucratic capability is “an indictment” of how transformation has been implemented.\nStill, Habib argued, this decline is not irreversible. Reclaiming strategic autonomy will require professionalising the public service, investing in education and research, and forging a credible national identity that avoids chauvinism and ideological grandstanding.\nHe warned against a political culture driven by what he called “silly politics” – racialised provocations and emotive, immature slogans – and urged leaders to steer public discourse towards national cohesiveness.\nUniversities and competence\nWhile geopolitical in framing, Habib’s address cut to the heart of debates about the role of universities in society. One of his most urgent themes was the need to reconcile transformation with excellence.\n“Representativity without excellence violates our constitution, as does excellence without representation,” he said. The South African higher education system, he suggested, too often approaches transformation and excellence as a trade-off rather than a synthesis. In doing so, it undermines both institutional credibility and broader social trust.\nFor universities, the implications are significant. As state capacity declines, institutions of higher learning may find themselves increasingly responsible for driving science diplomacy, regional integration, and public policy innovation. But, to do this, they must also confront their own weaknesses – in governance, research management and the often polarised nature of campus politics.\nHabib pointed to Singapore as a model of transformation that is not afraid of merit. The lesson, he said, is that countries – and, by extension, universities – must build professional competence if they want to command respect and effect change. “We lie to ourselves if we hold that this is not the case,” he warned.\nRethinking security\nAfrica Week brought together university leaders, researchers, policymakers, business figures and civil society from across the continent and beyond.\nThe 2025 edition took place under the theme, ‘Global Security, Global Africa’, probing the many faces of security in today’s complex world – not only military threats, but also pandemics, digital technologies, environmental breakdown and socio-economic exclusion.\n‘Knowledge imperative’\nIn opening the summit, UP Vice-Chancellor Professor Francis Petersen underlined the responsibility of universities in advancing African agency. Reflecting on the continent’s diversity and talent, he said: “If afforded the opportunity to be the best they can, our youth will contribute significantly to innovation and scientific research excellence.”\nHis remarks linked this year’s summit to broader continental efforts, including the African Union’s Agenda 2063 and the body’s 2025 theme on justice and reparations. These connections reinforced the idea that African universities are not peripheral to policy or politics – they are central to envisioning and enacting the future.\nMyranda Lutempo, the senior policy officer and head of programmes at the AU’s Southern Africa Regional Office, echoed the summit’s core themes. She described strategic autonomy, not only as a political ambition but as a “knowledge imperative”, stressing the need for universities to align their research and teaching with Africa’s development agendas.\nCourage required\nAs Africa navigates a fragmented international order and contends with compounding challenges – from conflict to climate risk – the idea of security, itself, must be rethought. That was the provocation behind Africa Week 2025’s core theme.\nRather than viewing security solely in military terms, the summit explored its social, ecological, economic and digital dimensions. It asked how African states and institutions could contribute to more just and sustainable global futures, and how knowledge systems might support resilience, rather than reproduce inequality.\nHabib’s contribution brought needed clarity to this agenda. He reminded the audience: “Here we are again.” Africa, he said, faces “an unstable political environment” in which its nations risk being “played off against each other” – as they were during the Cold War – with mineral spoils and extractive relationships repeating themselves under new guises.\nWhile the international landscape may be beyond Africa’s control, the competencies required to act within it are not. For the continent’s universities – and its leadership – the challenge is to shift from rhetorical defiance to strategic competence.\n“We can be the architects of our own collective future,” Habib said. “But it will require courage, competence and the willingness to make hard decisions.”\nThat challenge was laid bare at Africa Week 2025. It is now up to Africa’s universities and leaders to respond with resolve.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

After the 2014 revolution ousted those officials and Ukraine has seen a broader shift towards Europe, the early 2000s golf club – always more about status than love of sport – languished for years.\nStarting next year, KSE, one of Ukraine’s top private universities, will reopen the site as a new campus focused on expanding its STEM programmes to train engineers, mathematicians and tech professionals needed for the country’s defence, recovery and economy. KSE says it has already hired four mathematics professors from abroad to staff the math degree. The campus will also be open to the public.\nFull report on the Kyiv Independent site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Burroughs last month had blocked Trump from implementing a separate order prohibiting Harvard from enrolling international students, who make up more than a quarter of its student body.

United States President Donald Trump’s clampdown on foreign student visas is barely a week old, but it places the spotlight on a broader trend for Arab school-leavers to have alternatives at hand, writes Daniel Bardsley for The National.\nCountries such as Canada and Australia are seen as alternatives by those concerned that tighter restrictions under Trump, who took office for the second time in January, may scupper their dream of an American education.\nAs The National reported earlier this year, Gulf students are increasingly shifting away from US universities, though this is not necessarily linked to the Trump administration. The number of Emiratis studying in the US nearly halved between 2015 and 2023, from 2,900 to 1,500, while the number of Saudi students in the US fell from 61,287 to 15,989 in the same period.\nFull report on The National site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

However, Frederiksen, who is also the leader of the country’s Social Democrats party, wants to change this, stating that limiting the ban in this way had been a mistake.\n“There are gaps in the legislation that allow Muslim social control and oppression of women at educational institutions in Denmark,” Frederiksen told domestic media. “You have the right to be a person of faith and practise your religion, but democracy takes precedence.”\nFull report on the EuroNews site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Losing accreditation could hurt Columbia because it’s required for university students to gain access to federal money, including student grants and loans. It remains unclear how the commission will respond to the Education Department’s notification.\nFull report on the CNN site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The document mentions only the two federally controlled tribal colleges – Haskell Indian Nations University and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute – but notes the request for postsecondary programmes will drop from more than US$182 million this year to just over US$22 million for 2026.\nIf Congress supports the administration’s proposal, it would devastate the nation’s 37 tribal colleges and universities, said Ahniwake Rose, president and CEO of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium, which represents the colleges in Washington, DC. “The numbers that are being proposed would close the tribal colleges,” Rose told ProPublica. “They would not be able to sustain.”\nFull report on the ProPublica site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The payout – revealed in an Employment Court decision on Wednesday 4 June – is towards Wiles’ legal costs, after a three-week hearing in the Employment Court last year, reports RNZ.\nIn that case, the court found the university breached its contractual obligations to protect Wiles as harassment against her intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, it did not find the university had breached Wiles’ academic freedom, or claims related to Te Tiriti.\nIn her decision on Wednesday, Judge Joanna Holden said the parties were encouraged to agree to costs, but due to the university’s response Wiles found it necessary to return to court.\nFull report on the RNZ site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Geert Wilders, leader of the far-right Party for Freedom (PVV), pulled the plug on the government. Sometime in the autumn, the Netherlands will go to the polls again. Universities hope that policy-makers will once again allocate extra money to education and research, reports Hoger Onderwijs Persbureau.\nThe effects of the cuts are already visible, says umbrella association Universities of the Netherlands: “Layoffs, discontinued study programmes and stagnated research. It is imperative that policy-makers reverse this destructive government policy before it is too late,” a response reads. The Dutch Student Union has something similar to say. It hopes that the fall of the government “means the end of the horrendous cutbacks, and that the next government will invest in education, that the basic student grant will go up and that enough affordable student housing will be created”.\nOne thing won’t change in the coming months: the government itself. It will continue to govern with an “outgoing” status. The PVV ministers are stepping down, but Eppo Bruins is the education minister on behalf of New Social Contract and is likely to remain in office until a successor takes over.\nFull report on the Vox site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

An eighth fell off the list of the top 10% entirely, reports the Buenos Aires Herald.\nArgentina’s public university system has suffered from waves of cuts and budget freezes since President Javier Milei began his agenda of state cuts in late 2023. Universities struggled with the lack of a budget adjustment for 2024 despite 211.4% inflation in 2023, which resulted in massive marches and other protests to defend public education.\nDuring 2024, the situation was so dire that universities across the country were forced to switch off the lights and the heating because they couldn’t afford the bills, while the Hospital de Clínicas, part of the University of Buenos Aires, was forced to suspend some medical procedures. The government eventually increased the budget for basic operational costs and paid a meagre salary raise, but later vetoed a bill that would have granted universities a funding increase. The academic community continues to denounce non-existent research funding, evaporating salaries, and widespread cuts.\nFull report on the Buenos Aires Herald site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

He said the funding cuts were significant and carried the potential of long-term consequences for researchers, patients and participants, the broader university community, as well as medical research and healthcare across the country.\nSU spokesperson Martin Viljoen said: “SU confirms that, like other research-intensive universities in South Africa, it is also affected by the geopolitical funding policy changes. The university is still in the process of finalising its contingency plans towards optimally mitigating the associated risks. As such the university is not in a position to provide further comment at this stage.”\nFull report on the IOL site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The Bologna Process has adopted the 3-2-3 system of education: three years for an undergraduate degree, two (mostly) for a masters and three for a doctorate. Among EU states, only Bulgaria, Cyprus and Greece do not offer three-year undergraduate degrees and the government is trying to attract more foreign students with English-language programmes.\nPrivate universities that will soon start operating in Greece will offer three-year bachelor degree programmes and provide competition for state institutions, but their Greek graduates, as well as those studying abroad face some bureaucratic issues.\nFull report on The National Herald site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Mahila Court judge M Rajalakshmi handed down the sentence four days after convicting Gnanasekaran on 11 charges, including rape, abduction, wrongful confinement and criminal intimidation under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), the Information Technology Act, and the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act.\nThe judgment came nearly six months after the survivor, a 19-year-old student, filed a complaint on 24 December 2024. According to police, on the night of 23 December, the student and a male friend were sitting in the university campus when Gnanasekaran, a 37-year-old roadside biryani vendor with a long criminal record, confronted them. He pretended to record a video of the pair and used the threat of exposing the footage to manipulate and separate them.\nFull report on The Indian Express site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

So that was quite a technical obstacle,” said Professor Aaron Koller, who later this year will become the first Jewish occupant of the post since 1540.\nHenry’s motives for founding the Regius professorship of Hebrew studies read like a chapter from Wolf Hall, bound up with the aftermath of his divorce from Catherine of Aragon and England’s break with the church of Rome. Koller suspects Henry wanted to boost England’s intellectual firepower after the rupture with the papacy, with Hebrew a critical tool for retranslating sections of the Old Testament and offering competing interpretations to those used by the church in Rome.\nFull report on The Guardian site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The transition, formalised in a government decree published on 30 May, marks the latest milestone in Hungary’s ongoing restructuring of its higher education system. Five years ago, the government transferred state universities to public foundations run by public interest trusts.\nFull report on the bne IntelliNews site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The students were referred to the institution’s disciplinary committee after reports that they were part of a group of about 20 who, for about 90 minutes on 9 October, occupied the office of an academic they believed was integral to the university’s partnerships with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.\nFull report on The Guardian Australia site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The Competition and Markets Authority said it wanted to support collaboration where possible in a “very challenging” financial situation for the sector. A government review of how higher education will be funded in the long term is under way in England, and is expected to be published later this year.\nSir Nigel Carrington, who led the review for Universities UK, said more clarity was needed to prevent universities having to make decisions about which courses to close, or merge, in isolation from one another. He told the BBC there was a risk of “cold spots emerging in which there will be no opportunity for prospective students to study the subjects they want to study in their home cities or their home regions”.\nFull report on the BBC News site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The Max Planck Society, a German state-backed network of research centres, received 81 applications from the US this spring in its latest call for promising early-career women scientists looking to set up their own research labs. Last year’s call received 25 applications.\nFull report on the Reuters site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",
