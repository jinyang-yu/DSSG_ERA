The company is backed by decarbonization solutions provider ACT Group.\nAccording to Green Project Technologies, the new solution provides a renewable energy procurement platform, enabling enterprises to help suppliers of any size to purchase traceable clean energy, and connecting suppliers with renewable energy certificates (EACs).\nIn collaboration with ACT Group’s registry infrastructure platform CerQlar, the solution automates EAC transactions and registry operations to help ensure traceability and auditability, and helping to track, validate and report on supply chain emissions reductions.\nACT Group CEO Colin Crooks said:\n“By leveraging ACT Group’s market infrastructure, act50 ensures that every transaction is real, traceable, and credible,” said Colin Crooks, CEO of ACT Group. “It brings the same level of trust and rigor to Scope 3 action that companies have come to expect from their Scope 1 and 2 strategies.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Amazon pledged in 2019 to match all of the electricity consumed across its global operations, including data centers, corporate buildings, stores and fulfillment centers, with 100% renewable energy by 2030. While the company announced in July 2024 that it achieved its 100% clean energy goal 7 years ahead of schedule, it also stated at the time that the increasing demand for generative AI “will require different sources of energy than we originally projected,” and that it will explore new carbon-free energy sources in addition to its continued investments in renewables. The company recently revealed that it has invested over $1 billion over the past year in nuclear energy projects and technologies.\nThe transaction marks an expansion of the relationship between the companies. Last year, Amazon announced a deal to co-locate a data center facility next to Talen’s nuclear facility in Pennsylvania, helping to power data centers with carbon-free energy and preserving Talen’s existing reactor.\nTalen President and CEO Mac McFarland said:\n“Our agreement with Amazon is designed to provide us with a long-term, steady source of revenue and greater balance sheet flexibility through contracted revenues. We remain a first mover in this space and intend to continue to execute on our data center strategy. Talen is well-positioned to support Amazon’s energy needs as it invests further in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.”\nUnder the new agreement, Talen will provide Amazon with 1,920 megawatts of nuclear power through 2042, with options to further extend its duration, with the delivery schedule ramping over time, and reaching full volume by 2032.\nTalen and Amazon also said that they will pursue expanding the nuclear plant’s energy output through uprates, with the intent to add net-new energy to the PJM grid, and that they will explore building new Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) in Pennsylvania.\nAWS Vice President of Global Data Centers Kevin Miller said:\n“Amazon is proud to help Pennsylvania advance AI innovation through investments in the Commonwealth’s economic and energy future. That’s why we’re making the largest private sector investment in state history – $20B – to bring 1,250 high-skilled jobs and economic benefits to the state, while also collaborating with Talen Energy to help power our infrastructure with carbon-free energy.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The CSDDD was adopted with a 1,000 employee threshold in 2024, but had initially been set to apply with a 500 employee threshold before last-minute changes.\nThe EPP’s draft, however, would reduce the scope much further, with the proposal raising the threshold of companies covered by the CSRD and CSDDD to those with more than 3,000 employees and €450 million in revenue.\nSeveral of the proposals in the Commission’s Omnibus package target reducing reporting burdens on smaller businesses, including creating a limit, based on voluntary standards for SMEs (VSME), that larger companies can request from smaller companies in their value chains.\nThe EPP’s draft retains the VSME limit for smaller companies, but raises the threshold of smaller companies to 3,000, and adds language limiting value chain reporting requirements for companies, stating that if information is not available, companies should be allowed  “to explain the efforts made to obtain the necessary information about their chain of activities, the reasons why that information could not be obtained, and their plans to obtain such information in the future,” in order to be in compliance with their sustainability reporting obligations. For obligations to identify adverse impacts in supply chains, the draft adds language stating that for smaller companies, “companies within the scope should not seek to obtain information from their business partners but rely only on information that it already reasonably available,” except in cases of identified likely adverse impacts.\nAnother key change proposed by the EPP draft includes removing requirements for climate transition plans, replacing it with reporting on transition plans if companies have them. Additionally, the EPP draft removes language allowing member states to individually introduce more stringent sustainability due diligence requirements for specific areas such as emerging risks linked to new products or services.\nThe draft changes may make it more difficult for lawmakers in Parliament to find a compromise position on the Omnibus package. Initial debates on the package in March indicated a lack of consensus, with positions ranging from scrapping the CSRD and CSDDD altogether to pushing back substantially on the reductions proposed in the package.\nIn a post announcing the release of the proposal, Warborn said:\n“I’m entering this process with a clear ambition: to cut costs for businesses and go further than the Commission on simplification. Less red tape and fewer burdens for businesses. That’s how we strengthen Europe’s economy.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The IFRS released the inaugural general sustainability (IFRS S1) and climate (IFRS S2) reporting standards in June 2023. Following the release of the standards last year, IOSCO, the leading international policy forum and standards setter for securities regulators called on regulators to incorporate the standards into their sustainability reporting regulatory frameworks.\nAlongside its update, the IFRS Foundation announced the publication of an initial set of 17 “jurisdictional profiles” and 16 “jurisdictional snapshots,” aimed at providing transparency and evidencing progress towards adoption of ISSB Standards. Profiles are published when a jurisdiction’s approach to sustainability reporting is finalized and no longer subject to consultation. The publications are aimed at showing how ISSB Standards are being incorporated into jurisdictions’ frameworks, and to help jurisdictions draw from the experience of other jurisdictions.\nThe 17 jurisdictions profiled include Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Chile, Ghana, Hong Kong SAR, Jordan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Chinese Taipei, Tanzania, Türkiye and Zambia. Of these, the IFRS Foundation said that 14 have set a target to fully adopt the ISSB standards, while two are adopting the standards’ climate requirements, and one is partially incorporating the standards.\nAmong the 16 jurisdictions covered by the snapshots, 12 have published standards fully aligned with ISSB Standards or designed to deliver outcomes functionally aligned with those resulting from the application of ISSB Standards, the IFRS Foundation said, with three proposing standards incorporating a significant portion of the  ISSB standards, and one considering permitting the use of ISSB Standards. The IFRS Foundation said that it will publish profiles for these jurisdictions when they have finalized their decisions.\nFaber said:\n“The ISSB Standards are bringing clarity to investors on the risks and opportunities lying in value chains across time horizons in a rapidly changing world. A year ago, we committed to publishing detailed jurisdictional profiles describing adoption of our Standards to complement our Inaugural Jurisdictional Guide. The profiles provide a detailed current state-of-play to investors, banks and insurers who continue to struggle with the lack of appropriate, comparable and reliable information on these critical factors affecting business prospects.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

In 2023, lululemon launched a partnership with Samsara Eco as the recycling company’s first textile partner, working with the company to pioneer a new technology to extract nylon 6,6 from end-of-life textiles, and in February 2024, the companies announced the production of the first-ever product to be created using this form of circular solution for the difficult to recycle material. Later in 2024, the companies announced the launch of a new jacket, the first ever product to be produced using enzymatically recycled polyester.\nPaul Riley, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Samsara Eco, said:\n“Our expanded partnership with lululemon represents a strong step forward to help create a fully circular ecosystem and further highlights the industry’s commitment to transition to more circular materials. The technology to make circular materials is not a pipe dream – it is here, ready for adoption by forward-thinking companies. I’m incredibly optimistic about how we will help fuel circular apparel over the next decade with lululemon.”\nNylon 6,6 is one of the most commonly used plastics in the textile industry for the production of clothing, sportswear and outerwear fabrics, and accounts for a substantial portion of the materials used by lululemon, with benefits including durability and toughness, which also make it difficult to recycle. Polyester is Lululemon’s largest procured material by weight, at slightly over a third of the total materials used in its products, followed closely by Nylon.\nUnder the new agreement, Samsara Eco will supply lululemon with recycled nylon 6,6 and polyester.\nThe new agreement will support lululemon’s sustainable materials goals, which include targets to source 75% “preferred materials,” or those with improved environmental or social sustainability outcomes and impacts compared to conventional production, by 2025, and 100% by 2030. Earlier this year, lululemon announced a multi-year collaboration with biotechnology firm ZymoChem aimed at expanding the use of sustainable bio-based nylon in its products.\nTed Dagnese, Chief Supply Chain Officer at lululemon, said:\n“As we work toward our 2030 impact goals, we’re taking a diversified approach—investing in multiple partnerships to advance solutions and help reduce our reliance on fossil-fuel derived resources. Together with our partners, including Samsara Eco, we’re helping to turn our vision of a circular model into a reality.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Nescafé launched the strategy in 2022, with a commitment to invest over $1 billion in the plan by 2030.\nNescafé’s 2030 plan focuses heavily on helping farmers in its supply chain transition to regenerative agriculture practices. Regenerative agriculture practices are aimed at addressing the environmental impact of farming, and include techniques to improve and restore ecosystems, build soil health and fertility, reduce emissions, enhance watershed management, and increase biodiversity, resulting in increased yields and more climate-resilient soils, as well as improved farmers’ livelihoods.\nAs part of its initiatives, supporting coffee farmers transition to practices such as optimized fertilization, soil cover, mulching and composting, with the aim of improving productivity and lowering their costs.\nThe adoption of the regenerative agricultural practices also helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with Nescafé noting that participants of the Nescafé Plan achieved a reduction ranging from 20% to 40% of GHG emissions per kilogram of green coffee in 2024.\nWith the initial target met, Nescafé said that it is now pushing towards its next goal to reach 50% of coffee from farms with regenerative agricultural practices by 2030. Currently, the company said that the plan covers more than 400,000 hectares of coffee farmlands and that over 200,000 coffee farmers in 16 countries were trained in regenerative agriculture in 2024.\nAxel Touzet, Head of Nestlé’s Coffee Brands Strategic Business Unit, said:\n“Regenerative agriculture is at the heart of the Nescafé Plan and our efforts to build resilience in our coffee supply chain. This third Progress Report shows that farmers are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of these practices, as shown by the increased adoption rates. This encourages us to continue the work we do with our partners, suppliers and farmers in the regions where we source our coffee.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The company’s platform combines wireless technology and hardware and cloud-based software to automate building operations to help building owners and operators reduce energy use and costs, while improving reliability, comfort, and control.\nAccording to Runwise, its platform has been installed in more than 10,000 buildings across the U.S., and has to date delivered over $115 million in energy cost savings and has cut carbon emissions equivalent to more than 100,000 cars.\nThe company said that the new capital will be used to support product innovation, team expansion, as well as entry into new core markets across the U.S. and globally.\nJeff Carleton, CEO & Co-Founder of Runwise, said:\n“Most buildings—old and new—still run on 1960s technology, wasting billions of dollars, making living and working in cities less safe and comfortable, and generating massive amounts of CO2.”\nLee Hoffman, President & Co-Founder of Runwise, added:\n“Every building needs to be rebuilt with software, not bricks. That’s what we’re doing at Runwise, transforming outdated infrastructure into intelligent systems that can be installed in a day, paid back in months, and scaled across entire portfolios.”\nThe Series B round was led by Menlo Ventures, with the debt financing from Multiplier Capital. Additional investors participating in the round included new investors MassMutual Ventures, Nuveen Real Estate, and Munich Re Ventures, and returning investors Soma Capital, Alumni Ventures, Helium-3, Cooley, and Fifth Wall.\nSteve Sloane, Partner at Menlo Ventures, said:\n“Over the next decade, there will only be two types of companies: those that drive AI innovation and those that enable AI to transform the physical world. Runwise is perfectly positioned at the intersection of these forces, bridging the critical gap between AI and the built environment. Their platform is fundamentally changing how buildings operate, creating smarter, more sustainable spaces at scale. We’re excited to partner with Runwise as they bring this transformative tech to new heights.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Green bonds are already covered under a separate framework.\nThe new framework includes disclosure requirements before and after issuance of the securities, as well as requirements for the use of third-party reviewers for the disclosures and to assess alignment with standards.\nThe new framework sets out a requirement for bonds only to be labelled as Social, Sustainability or SLBs if they fund projects aligned with recognized standards or fall under definitions set out by organizations such as the ICMA Principles or Climate Bonds Standard.\nThe new rules also set specific categories for use of proceeds for social bonds, including affordable basic infrastructure, access to essential services, employment generation and alleviation of unemployment, food security, and socioeconomic advancement and empowerment.\nWhen issuing social bonds, the framework requires disclosures including the objectives of the social project, including the target population and intended benefits, details of the decision-making process for determining the eligibility of the projects, the procedures to be used to track the deployment of proceeds. After issuance, the framework includes ongoing disclosure requirements to be made in the issuer’s annual report, covering areas including utilization of proceeds and details of unutilized proceeds.\nSocial bond issuers are also required to appoint an independent third party reviewer to ascertain that the labelled securities align with recognized standards, and to follow post-issue management of the bond proceeds, and to verify internal tracking and impact reporting.\nFor SLBs, required disclosures include details of the issuer’s sustainability and business strategy, definition of sustainability Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and details of the sustainability performance targets (SPTs), and the rationale for how the KPIs were selected, as well as for how they fit into the issuer’s sustainability strategy and how they address relevant ESG challenges.\nThe new framework also includes a series requirements for the use of third-party reviewers for SLBs, including for assessment and certification of the relevance, robustness and reliability of the selected KPIs, the material linkage of the KPIs to the issuer’s sustainability and business strategy, and the rationale and level of ambition of the proposed SPTs, among others.\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

This is part of the reason why businesses make environmental claims in the first place. Because these claims matter, it is important to get them right. These guidelines provide businesses with tools to help them do just that.”\nClick here to access the guidance.\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The EBA is also proposing introducing the possibility of reducing the frequency of some disclosures for large banks based on materiality reasons.\nThe EBA launched a public consultation on the new proposals, with submissions due by August 22, 2025.

It’s also the basis for the ENERGY STAR certification that helps real estate owners distinguish their building from the one down the street in terms of energy efficiency.\nAll of this is free – thanks to taxpayers who have funded the government-run program – and has produced a fantastic ROI of $350 for every $1 invested (according to EPA).\nBut with the U.S. administration proposing to eliminate ENERGY STAR, ESPM is set to go with it. That raises a pivotal question: how will real estate measure and benchmark energy and sustainability if ESPM disappears?\nA New Way Forward\nDoing nothing isn’t an option. Measuring and acting on energy and sustainability is more than a reporting exercise – it’s integral to efficiency, compliance, capital access, and long-term value. Energy-efficient retrofits yield an average ROI of 15–20% within five years, and BXP—the world’s largest publicly traded office REIT – has saved $2.2 million annually in energy costs since 2017 using Measurabl’s solution Optimize.\nESPM underpins this success, but if the status quo doesn’t hold, what should a replacement look like? When talking with our customers, which include many of the world’s largest real estate organizations, five key considerations are on their minds:\nFunding: Should we depend on taxpayer-funded tools to manage mission-critical software products and solutions?\nBenchmarking: Should performance standards be based on CBECS – a survey updated once every several years and based on a relatively small sample size?\nPolitics: Should building data be placed in government programs vulnerable to shifting politics?\nGlobalization: Should tools be North American-centric when real estate is a global business?\nInnovation: Can government offerings keep pace with dynamic regulatory and operational demands?\nMy takeaway from listening to the industry is this: the present situation is a forcing mechanism to confront systemic, significant gaps – ones that remain critical whether ESPM stays or goes.\nA Blueprint for What’s Next\nToday’s reality of interlocking global climate regulation, sophisticated investor scrutiny, portfolio-scale Op/CapEx decision-making, and the fundamentally international nature of the real estate industry, is far more complex than it was a quarter century ago. It coincides with a world where energy, carbon and environment are political, not just business considerations. What’s needed now and next, is a system designed with these considerations in mind.\nSupporting U.S. regulations is not enough. Capital is global. Nor is a benchmark derived from a small survey conducted every few years (CBECS) sufficient to power real estate transactions done every day around the world. In the age of AI and data science, we should have  transactional-grade metrics delivered near real time. Energy and GHG intensity, and climate risk exposure are financial inputs increasingly applied across underwriting, valuation, and leasing decisions. These datapoints must flow easily from one decisionmaker to another, and to the systems that assist them. The infrastructure need not be taxpayer funded nor exposed to political influence and ideology. It should be by industry, for industry. Real estate is the world’s largest asset class and its largest source of carbon emissions. Therefore resourcing should be commensurate with this scale and potential impact. Instead, ESPM relies on a budget of a few million per year.\nI’ve distilled these questions and proposed solutions into five guiding principles should pave the way to a better benchmark and an improved business case for sustainability overall:\nFor Industry, By Industry\nIndustry tools and data should be governed by the software users and data providers.\nMarket-Driven Innovation\nTools must evolve and improve at pace with the market. AI, automation, and dynamic benchmarking are all table stakes.\nGlobally Referenceable\nMetrics should be consistent and comparable across portfolios and regions, to reduce regulatory friction, and investor confusion.\nAgnostic\nAlignment is key in an industry of real estate’s scale. Any organization that contributes or adds value to data should be able to participate.\nSustainable Business Model\nAccess to tools like data management, benchmarking and reporting should remain free. To ensure durability of the solution, and drive the pace of innovation and ROI called for, the platform must have transparent revenue streams.\nBridging the Gap\nAs the future of ESPM remains unclear, maintaining continuity is essential. Measurabl takes the potential discontinuation of ESPM seriously. As the world’s most widely adopted sustainability data platform after ESPM – and a six-time ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year – we’re ready to support the industry through any transition by offering free accounts. Our initial goal was to safeguard data. Our second goal was to provide continuity of day to day business activities like data aggregation, benchmarking, and reporting, which is why we included a range of sophisticated, enterprise-grade features in our free offering. What comes next will be a paradigm shift in the business model and toolkit offered to industry and the ecosystem that serves it.\nWe’re at an inflection point, and that’s a positive thing. For decades, ESPM helped prove the business case for sustainability. Now, we have the chance to evolve it. Whether ESPM stays or goes, the question before us remains the same: what do we want real estate’s future to look like? If we choose to act decisively, collaborate intentionally, and invest wisely, the answer could be a more profitable, resilient, and sustainable path forward for all.\nESG Today Guest Post\nRelated Posts\nEnvironment /\nLululemon Signs Deal to Buy Recycled Materials for up to 20% of its Total Fibers\nGuest Posts /\nGuest Post – The Sustainability Crossroads: 3 Issues Investors Cannot Ignore\nEnvironment /\nEPA Proposes Scrapping GHG Emissions Standards for Power Plants\n‹ Proxima Raises Record $149 Million in Drive to First Fusion Power Plant › Munich Re Exits Major Net Zero Coalitions\nESG Today Newsletter – Subscribe\nSubscribe to the ESG Today Newsletter\nJoin our mailing list for the latest breaking ESG investment news!\nLevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther\nFunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsR & DProcurement & ContractingSupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityStrategyTechnologyOther\nSUBSCRIBE!\nYou have Successfully Subscribed!\nSustainable Finance\nFervo Energy Raises Over $200 Million to Build U.S. Geothermal Energy Project\nMunich Re Exits Major Net Zero Coalitions\nAccounting Body ACCA Calls on EU to Simplify Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\nIndia Launches New Regulations for Social, Sustainability, Sustainability-Linked Bonds\nGovernment\nEU Parliament’s Omnibus Negotiator Proposes Much Sharper Cuts to Sustainability Reporting Regulations\nEPA Proposes Scrapping GHG Emissions Standards for Power Plants\nAccounting Body ACCA Calls on EU to Simplify Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\nBlackRock Removed from Texas Boycott List After Leaving Climate Groups\nCategories\nSelect Category\nCompanies\nEnergy Transition\nEnvironment\nESG Reporting\nESG Tools, Services\nExecutive Moves\nGovernance\nGovernment\nGuest Posts\nInvestors\nM&A\nNew funds & products\nPlatforms & Markets\nPrivate Equity & Venture Capital\nProfessional bodies\nRegulators\nReports, Studies\nSocial\nSocial & Governance\nSustainable Finance\nBack to Top\nHome\nAbout us\nDisclosure, cookies & privacy policy\n© ESG Today 2025\nDon't miss the top ESG stories!\nJoin the ESG Today daily newsletter and get all the top ESG stories, like this one.\nSubscribe now below!\nLevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther\nFunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsProcurement & ContractingR & DStrategySupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityTechnologyOther\nSUBSCRIBE!\nYou have Successfully Subscribed!",

Today’s environment will test corporate sustainability commitments, the direction of responsible investing, and the regulatory momentum behind environmental and social progress. Investors who navigate these challenges thoughtfully may stand poised to not only mitigate risk but also uncover potential opportunities for long-term value creation.\nSome of the key issues that will help shape the landscape moving forward may include: potential backsliding on climate action, the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence (AI), and the heightened scrutiny of hazardous chemicals in consumer and medical products. Each present both risks and opportunities for investors seeking companies that are prepared for the future.\nClimate Action at a Tipping Point\nThe new U.S. presidential administration has already triggered rollbacks in key environmental policies, including emissions regulations and climate commitments. Efforts to weaken the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) could slow the transition to clean energy, while other countries, particularly China and the European Union, work to position themselves as global sustainability leaders. These changes will reshape market dynamics, impacting companies that benefit regulatory incentives for emissions reduction and green innovation.\nFor investors, the question is no longer whether climate risk is material, but how businesses will respond, especially in the face of continued losses from extreme weather events. Some may scale back their efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy as regulation is rolled back. For example, some high-emitting companies may feel emboldened to increase emissions or reduce or eliminate transition-related activities. However, others will recognize this moment as an opportunity to lead, investing in clean energy, supply chain resilience, and emissions reduction. As extreme weather events continue disrupting industries, companies integrating climate risk into their long-term strategies may be well-positioned to outperform their peers.\nBeyond direct policy impacts, financial institutions are adjusting their risk assessments. Insurers have been retreating from high-risk areas, and lenders are incorporating climate resilience into credit decisions. Companies that ignore these risks may face higher borrowing costs, limited insurance options, and operational disruptions. Investors should look for businesses that see climate action not as a regulatory burden, but as a competitive advantage.\nThe AI Reckoning: Navigating Ethical Risks\nArtificial intelligence is evolving at an extraordinary pace, already transforming key sectors of the global economy. From financial services and healthcare to logistics and retail, companies are using AI to unlock efficiency and streamline operations. Yet as adoption accelerates, so do the ethical and material risks associated with accuracy, misinformation, bias, and data privacy, among others. These concerns have sparked global regulatory scrutiny, with new AI legislation expected to shape corporate governance and ethical standards.\nFor investors, it is important to understand how companies view and manage the opportunities and risks of AI within their business. Technology’s growing influence on critical business decisions, such as access to healthcare, housing, insurance, credit and education has individual implications, which makes transparency, safety, and fairness not just ethical concerns, but imperatives. Companies integrating privacy protections into AI systems will likely gain competitive advantages, while those that rush adoption without safeguards may face reputational damage, lawsuits, and consumer backlash.\nResponsible AI is fast becoming a marker of long-term resilience. Companies that conduct public risk assessments, maintain transparent product lifecycles, and uphold human rights in their AI policies are better equipped to earn trust and sustain value. In contrast, firms that prioritize “growth at all costs” may expose themselves to backlash and litigation and risk serious fallout.\nAI is also increasingly driving progress in sustainability, with leading companies using it to improve energy efficiency, cut waste, and streamline supply chains. Those aligning AI strategies with environmental goals like carbon tracking and smart resource management are positioning themselves for long-term relevance.\nCompanies that lead with fairness, accountability, and foresight in their use of AI are more likely to thrive in a shifting landscape. Investors should closely evaluate whether firms are not only innovating with AI but doing so in a way that is built to last.\nThe Chemical Reckoning: Investors and Consumers Demand Safer Products\nPublic and regulatory scrutiny of hazardous chemicals, including PFAS and other synthetic substances, continues to rise. Some synthetic chemicals are necessary in products but can be used more responsibly and potentially replaced by sustainable alternatives. Hazardous chemicals, found in everyday consumer goods, medical devices, and industrial applications, have been linked to cancer, endocrine disruption, and environmental contamination.\nAlthough some federal regulations have stalled, some individual states and global markets are pushing forward with stricter chemical safety laws. Notably, in April 2025, the EPA announced a broad suite of actions to combat PFAS contamination, including new testing strategies, industrial discharge guidelines, and efforts to strengthen enforcement.\nConsumer awareness is also growing. Transparency is no longer optional, as demand continues to increase for clean-label products free from harmful substances. Companies that fail to address chemical risks may face lawsuits, recalls, and reputational damage, while those that proactively reformulate products and disclose chemical ingredients may stand to gain market share.\nFrom an investment perspective, chemical mismanagement can represent a financial liability. High-profile lawsuits and multimillion-dollar settlements over chemical exposure have demonstrated the risks of weak safety policies. Investors should seek out companies with clear chemical management strategies that go beyond compliance to future-proof their business against evolving regulations and consumer expectations.\nWhat This Means for Investors\nIt’s important for investors to look at sustainability as a forward-looking investment strategy that identifies businesses built for resilience and long-term growth. Climate policy reversals will test corporate commitments, AI will challenge ethical boundaries, and chemical safety will redefine consumer expectations.\nAs regulatory landscapes shift and consumer demands evolve, businesses that prepare for a low-carbon future, integrate responsible AI, and address chemical risks may not only avoid pitfalls but can create new growth opportunities.\nThe challenge for investors is to cut through short-term market noise and identify companies taking sustainability seriously. Whether through proactive climate planning, responsible AI adoption, or safer product innovation, businesses that embrace these shifts will be the ones driving the market forward. Sustainability is clearly at a crossroads, but for investors who remain engaged while navigating these key issues, the opportunity to build stronger, more resilient portfolios, is now.\nESG Today Guest Post\nRelated Posts\nGuest Posts /\nGuest Post: How the Dismantling of ENERGY STAR Could Change Sustainability Benchmarking\nInvestors /\nMunich Re Exits Major Net Zero Coalitions\nGuest Posts /\nGuest Post – Beyond Emission Reduction: Why Heavy Industry Should Embrace Carbon Removal Now\n‹ Leading law firm launches industry first social justice fund › Investors Turning Outside U.S. to Look for Climate Investment Opportunities: Survey\nESG Today Newsletter – Subscribe\nSubscribe to the ESG Today Newsletter\nJoin our mailing list for the latest breaking ESG investment news!\nLevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther\nFunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsR & DProcurement & ContractingSupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityStrategyTechnologyOther\nSUBSCRIBE!\nYou have Successfully Subscribed!\nSustainable Finance\nFervo Energy Raises Over $200 Million to Build U.S. Geothermal Energy Project\nMunich Re Exits Major Net Zero Coalitions\nAccounting Body ACCA Calls on EU to Simplify Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\nIndia Launches New Regulations for Social, Sustainability, Sustainability-Linked Bonds\nGovernment\nEU Parliament’s Omnibus Negotiator Proposes Much Sharper Cuts to Sustainability Reporting Regulations\nEPA Proposes Scrapping GHG Emissions Standards for Power Plants\nAccounting Body ACCA Calls on EU to Simplify Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\nBlackRock Removed from Texas Boycott List After Leaving Climate Groups\nCategories\nSelect Category\nCompanies\nEnergy Transition\nEnvironment\nESG Reporting\nESG Tools, Services\nExecutive Moves\nGovernance\nGovernment\nGuest Posts\nInvestors\nM&A\nNew funds & products\nPlatforms & Markets\nPrivate Equity & Venture Capital\nProfessional bodies\nRegulators\nReports, Studies\nSocial\nSocial & Governance\nSustainable Finance\nBack to Top\nHome\nAbout us\nDisclosure, cookies & privacy policy\n© ESG Today 2025\nDon't miss the top ESG stories!\nJoin the ESG Today daily newsletter and get all the top ESG stories, like this one.\nSubscribe now below!\nLevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther\nFunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsProcurement & ContractingR & DStrategySupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityTechnologyOther\nSUBSCRIBE!\nYou have Successfully Subscribed!",

They will likely continue to increase over the coming decades. Developing and integrating carbon removal provides industrial companies with an additional and complementary set of tools for addressing these pressures. Initial piloting activities of carbon removal technologies, such as integrating carbon capture into desalination, pulp and paper, wastewater, and mining facilities, are showing that this does not necessarily need to cost industrial companies money. Proactive engagement with CDR offers tangible commercial opportunities, from improving efficiency, accessing nascent carbon markets, and generating green product premiums. It could also help mitigate future regulatory risks and potential carbon tax obligations. This isn’t just about environmental responsibility; it’s about smart commercial strategy in an uncertain world.\nReason 2: Industries can leverage existing assets and synergies to have impact\nIncorporating carbon removal does not necessarily require radical overhauls or disruptive technologies. Our report highlights that many heavy industries possess underutilized assets and inherent synergies that can be leveraged for carbon removal and even further emissions reductions.\nFor example, waste streams from agriculture and forestry, construction and demolition, desalination, mining, steel, or wastewater processing can be put to use for long-term carbon removal and storage. Physical infrastructure in those industries and others can be made more productive by integrating CDR activities. This requires innovation in processes, operations, and business models. But it does not necessarily require scientific and technological leaps. Smart innovation within existing operational frameworks, using existing assets, can enhance early adopters’ near-term performance and long-term growth and resilience.\nReason 3: Investing now in carbon removal can future-proof your business\nInvesting in carbon removal now is an investment in future-proofing operations against a changing world and business environment. Relevant key trends include greater national prioritization of industrial innovation and growth, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, and growing markets for removing carbon from the air. Companies that proactively integrate carbon removal into their operations will be better informed on carbon removal technology and operationalization and better positioned to navigate these trends and maintain their relevance and competitiveness over the long haul.\nHow industries can get engaged with carbon removal\nHere are the actionable steps heavy industries should consider:\nAssess the carbon removal opportunity for your business, evaluating existing relevant operations and assets.\nCollaborate with other stakeholders to form new relationships and build knowledge.\nInvest in research, development and demonstration, allocating resources to pilot projects and demonstrations.\nUpdate your commercial goals to integrate carbon removal insights and create separate targets for decarbonization and carbon removal.\nThese steps will unlock opportunities to integrate carbon removal into existing industrial processes, drive greater efficiency, productivity, and help companies meet tightening regulatory requirements.\nESG Today Guest Post\nRelated Posts\nEnvironment /\nLululemon Signs Deal to Buy Recycled Materials for up to 20% of its Total Fibers\nGuest Posts /\nGuest Post: How the Dismantling of ENERGY STAR Could Change Sustainability Benchmarking\nEnvironment /\nEPA Proposes Scrapping GHG Emissions Standards for Power Plants\n‹ Actis Raises $1.7 Billion for Brownfield Infrastructure Investment Fund › CDP Restructures, Looks to Reduce Sustainability Reporting Burden\nESG Today Newsletter – Subscribe\nSubscribe to the ESG Today Newsletter\nJoin our mailing list for the latest breaking ESG investment news!\nLevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther\nFunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsR & DProcurement & ContractingSupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityStrategyTechnologyOther\nSUBSCRIBE!\nYou have Successfully Subscribed!\nSustainable Finance\nFervo Energy Raises Over $200 Million to Build U.S. Geothermal Energy Project\nMunich Re Exits Major Net Zero Coalitions\nAccounting Body ACCA Calls on EU to Simplify Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\nIndia Launches New Regulations for Social, Sustainability, Sustainability-Linked Bonds\nGovernment\nEU Parliament’s Omnibus Negotiator Proposes Much Sharper Cuts to Sustainability Reporting Regulations\nEPA Proposes Scrapping GHG Emissions Standards for Power Plants\nAccounting Body ACCA Calls on EU to Simplify Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\nBlackRock Removed from Texas Boycott List After Leaving Climate Groups\nCategories\nSelect Category\nCompanies\nEnergy Transition\nEnvironment\nESG Reporting\nESG Tools, Services\nExecutive Moves\nGovernance\nGovernment\nGuest Posts\nInvestors\nM&A\nNew funds & products\nPlatforms & Markets\nPrivate Equity & Venture Capital\nProfessional bodies\nRegulators\nReports, Studies\nSocial\nSocial & Governance\nSustainable Finance\nBack to Top\nHome\nAbout us\nDisclosure, cookies & privacy policy\n© ESG Today 2025\nDon't miss the top ESG stories!\nJoin the ESG Today daily newsletter and get all the top ESG stories, like this one.\nSubscribe now below!\nLevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther\nFunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsProcurement & ContractingR & DStrategySupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityTechnologyOther\nSUBSCRIBE!\nYou have Successfully Subscribed!",

While most investors in Europe (62%) and Asia Pacific (59%) continue to include climate change as a key priority, the decline has been particularly sharp in North America, falling to 23% from 35% last year, and 61% in 2023.\nTrump’s policies are having a clear impact on investor’s climate-related investment decisions, with nearly 60% of respondents reporting that they will see how the new U.S. policy agenda develops before making any investment decisions involving any assets likely to be affected by proposed changes to U.S. policies and regulations.\nNotably, however, the survey found that most investors see the impact of the new U.S. administration’s policies as temporary. According to the study, 56% of investors said that while U.S. policy will setback global progress towards net zero, but expect momentum will recover when President Trump leaves office. Similarly, 53% of respondents said that new U.S. government policy is likely to slow down their progress on decarbonizing investment portfolios, but that the impact will only be short-term, and less than a third said that it will have an adverse impact on reaching net zero in investment portfolios. Additionally, nearly two-thirds of investors expect climate change to become central or significant in their investment policies in the next two years, potentially reversing the decline in 2024.\nThe new administration’s policies are also driving investors to look for climate-related opportunities in other markets, with 58% of European investors and 62% of Asia Pacific investors – and even 38% of North America investors – reporting that they will be more likely to look outside of the U.S. for investments in areas such as climate solutions, transitioning companies and renewable energy.\nAccording to Robeco, investor’s focus on climate change in their investment policies is likely related to government policy support for the net zero transition in their own regions, with the survey finding that over the next five years, 52% of European investors and 62% of Asia Pacific investors expect their own governments to maintain or increase policies supporting net zero, compared with only 4% of North American investors.\nThe survey also found that despite the geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds, investors are maintaining allocation plans for climate solutions investments, and 39% said that they actually plan to invest more in climate solutions. Specific climate mitigation solution areas targeted for increased or new investments over the next 2 years included electricity grid modernization, cited by 39% or respondents, followed by renewable energy and clean power by 34% and new battery technologies, sustainable real estate and green buildings and carbon capture and storage technologies, each at 31%.\nAdditionally, while around half of investors said that climate adaptation and resilience will become an increasingly attractive growth theme for equity investments over the next three to five years, respondents noted a series of barriers that have kept allocations in this area low to date, including 58% citing uncertainty about the ability to achieve competitive risk-adjusted returns, 47% lacking suitable investment products, and 42% reporting that it is hard to identify credible climate adaptation companies.\nLucian Peppelenbos, Climate and Biodiversity Strategist at Robeco, said:\n“This year’s survey highlights a sobering reality: while many investors remain committed to climate goals, the overall prioritization of climate change in investment strategies is showing signs of decline, particularly at the global level.\n“This underscores the importance of staying focused and adaptable. We recognize that our clients are navigating a complex and evolving landscape, with varying levels of policy support and market confidence. Our role is to support them – wherever they are on their sustainability journey – by aligning our investment strategies with their specific goals, whether focused on return, risk, sustainability, or a combination of all three.”\nClick here to access the survey.\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

This technology allows us to create a force multiplier effect where complex data analysis and tasks are automated, freeing our clients to focus on the strategic initiatives and innovations that lead to greater impact – a fundamental shift in how organizations can accelerate on their energy and decarbonization journeys.”\nPicaud joins Schneider Electric from sustainability data management solutions provider Sweep, where he served as Global Director of Product Marketing. Prior to joining Sweep, he served as Global Senior Director of Marketing and Product Marketing at ESG and sustainability software provider Enablon.\nCommenting on the new initiative, Dan Whitsell, CTO and Head of Software Engineering for Schneider’s Sustainability Business division, said:\n“Recognizing the energy intensity of AI, we are committed to developing and deploying this investment with a focus on computational efficiency and responsible resource usage. By integrating the principles of frugal AI, we are designing systems that deliver maximum intelligence with minimal resource consumption. This means leveraging leaner models, efficient algorithms, and optimized infrastructure to reduce energy use, emissions, and costs without sacrificing performance.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The move was designed to promote a shift away from coal to cleaner power sources, such as natural gas and renewables.\nThe Supreme Court ruled in 2022, however, that the EPA did not have the authority to devise emissions caps to promote a shift from high-emissions to low-emissions energy generation sources. Following the ruling, the Biden administration EPA introduced new standards requiring more CO2 emissions controls to be put in place at fossil fuel-fired power plants, and introducing carbon capture and storage (CCS) requirements for the plants.\nUnder the new proposals, the EPA is moving to repeal the 2015 emissions standards for new fossil fuel-fired power plants and the Biden administration’s new rules. The EPA said that the rules’ targeted emissions are global in nature, rather than air pollutants with a regional or local impact, and that health harms from the GHG emissions “have not been accurately attributed to emissions from the U.S. power sector.” Additionally, the EPA added that it is proposing that fossil fuel power plant GHG emissions “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution within the meaning of the statute.”\nThe EPA added that the proposed repeal would save the power sector approximately $1.2 billion per year, in regulatory costs, or $19 billion over two decades.\nAdditionally, the EPA said that it is proposing to 2024 amendments to MATS, including more stringent particulate matter emissions and mercury emissions standards for coal plants, and a requirement for continuous monitoring for emissions, which the agency said would save $1.2 billion in regulatory costs over a decade.\nSustainability-focused groups attacked the new proposals. Shaun Goho, legal director at Clean Air Task Force (CATF), said:\n“These regressive proposals are bad for public health and bad for climate, all to prop up some of the highest polluting power plants in the nation. These standards were put in place for a reason – to fulfill the EPA’s legal obligations to protect public health and the environment from harmful pollution by using the most up-to-date technical and scientific evidence. And the science is clear: if EPA is successful in its repeal of these regulations, the American people will suffer the consequences.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The company uses techniques such as horizontal drilling and distributed fiber optic sensing to make reservoirs of hot rock that exist beneath the earth’s surface into clean energy sources.\nThe company is currently developing its first greenfield development, Cape Station, in Beaver County, Utah. The project produces energy by injecting water into hot subsurface rock formations, extracting the heated water, and using it to generate electricity. Cape Station is expected to begin delivering 100 MW of power to the grid in its first phase in 2026, with a further 400 MW anticipated to come online in a second phase by 2028. The project has received permitting approval to expand up to 2 GW.\nThe new capital follows a $255 funding announcement by Fervo for the project in late 2024. The company said that with full funding in place and construction underway, the Cape Station project is on track for its 2026 commercial operation date.\nDavid Ulrey, Chief Financial Officer at Fervo Energy, said:\n“These investments demonstrate what we’ve known all along: Fervo’s combination of technical excellence, commercial readiness, and market opportunity makes us a natural partner for serious energy capital. The confidence our investors have in Fervo and in the Cape asset affirms that next-generation geothermal is ready to play a defining role in America’s energy future.”\nThe new capital includes $100 million in project-level preferred equity from Bill Gates-backed green tech investment program Breakthrough Energy Catalyst, in addition to a $60 million upsizing to an existing corporate term loan facility from energy and commodity group Mercuria, as well as $46 million in upsizing from an original bridge loan from construction financing-focused XRL-ALC (XRA).\nAccording to the company, the investment from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst followed an intensive technical, financial, and environmental diligence process. Mario Fernandez, Head of Catalyst at Breakthrough Energy, said:\n“Cape Station marks a major step forward in unlocking the infrastructure capital and project financing needed to commercialize EGS. This project proves what’s possible when breakthrough innovation meets disciplined delivery. It sets the foundation for a model that can be repeated well beyond this site to provide affordable, reliable, and clean energy to the world.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The regulation’s underlying goals include helping to attract private funding to facilitate the transition towards greater sustainability, and helping companies pursue transition-related opportunities.\nThe Commission issued its call for evidence last month, seeking input on its initiative to revise the SfDR in order to improve the regulation’s usefulness and reduce reporting and compliance burdens for investors. Specific aims highlighted by the Commission included simplifying key concepts of the SFDR, and streamlining and reducing disclosure requirements, with a focus on the most essential information for investors.\nAccording the ACCA’s response, the requirements of the SFDR are “too granular and complex,” creating constraints that “have prevented the SFDR’s aims and objectives being fully achieved.” In its letter, ACCA said that the large volume of data required under the SFDR can strain asset managers’ budgets and “lead to sustainable financial products being deprioritized.” ACCA also said that the lack of strong enforcement mechanisms in the SFDR has created concerns that some asset managers may not sully comply with the regulation, undermining its effectiveness in promoting sustainable practices.\nACCA’s response also said that the regulation has limited applicability for smaller firms with limited resources to comply with its requirements, hindering the adoption of ESG integration by these firms. Additionally, ACCA said that the SFDR has an insufficient focus on social factors, calling on the Commission to consider how social elements can be incorporated further into product categories, and that the regulation’s “do no significant harm” test lacked clarity.\nIn its review, the Commission said that it will explore the case for categorizing financial products that make sustainability-related claims. Potential categories would reflect the various sustainability objectives of the financial products, such as products contributing to a sustainability objective, products contributing to the transition, or products contributing to other ESG strategies.\nIn its response, ACCA said that it agrees with the Commission’s decision to reconsider the regulation’s product categorization approach, noting that the current Article 8 and Article 9 system was identified as “being stringent to the point of a barrier to entry.”\nACCA called on the Commission to consider a transition-focused approach, and to create more flexibility and phase in the regulation’s implementation.\nJoe Fitzsimons, Regional Lead Policy and Insights, EEMA & UK, ACCA, said:\n“EC was a first mover in establishing SFDR to combat greenwashing and is now looking to address undue burdens by simplifying and streamlining the requirements. We encourage the EC to use this first mover advantage and revisions process as an opportunity to influence wider global regulations.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

Texas is the largest net energy supplier in the U.S., providing nearly a quarter of the country’s domestically produced energy, and accounting for over 40% of the nation’s crude oil proved reserves and production, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).\nUnder Texas law, the Comptroller is required to maintain and update a “list of financial companies that boy energy companies,” with the law giving companies given 90 days to “cease boycotting energy companies in order to avoid qualifying for divestment by state governmental entities.”\nBlackRock was one of the investment companies first included on the list when it was launched by the Comptroller’s office in 2022. While Hegar welcomed changes made by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list and noted that “it took the company longer than others in the financial sector to make the shift,” each of the other investment companies included on the initial 2022 list remain on the updated list, expect for Credit Suisse, which has been acquired by UBS – which is also on the updated list.\nIn a statement announcing the removal of BlackRock from the list, Hegar said:\n“This is a meaningful victory and validates the leadership Texas has shown on this issue, which has seen a monumental shift in the way companies, governments and individual Americans view the energy sector.”\nThe Comptroller’s office listed a series of moves by BlackRock that led to its removal from the list, including the investment manager’s decision to exit the Net Zero Asset Managers (NZAM) initiative and to reduce its participation in Climate Action 100+, as well as reducing the number of fund offerings that prohibit investment in oil and gas. Hegar added that BlackRock “shifted away from blanket policies that ignore the critical need for fossil fuel-based energy generation now and long into the future.”\n15 companies remain on the Comptroller’s list, including AMP, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole, Danske Bank, HSBC, Impax Asset Management, Jupiter Fund Management, NatWest, Nordea Bank, Rathbones, Schroders, Societe Generale, Svenska Handelsbanken, Swedbank and UBS, in addition to hundreds of individual funds.\nIn a statement provided to ESG Today, a BlackRock spokesperson said:\n“We appreciate the Comptroller’s resolution of this matter. BlackRock is proud to help millions of Texans retire with dignity and, on behalf of clients, invests over $400 billion in corporations, local governments, energy infrastructure and other private assets throughout the state. These investments support the continued growth of the Texas economy.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.
