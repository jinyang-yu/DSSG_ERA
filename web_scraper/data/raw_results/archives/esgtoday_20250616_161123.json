Most notably, a requirement to report on facilitated emissions, or those from capital markets and financial advisory activities, has been removed. Additionally, reporting under the framework on financed emissions has been changed from a requirement to disclose on all 18 TCFD sectors “regardless of materiality” to reporting on these sectors only “where material.”\nAdvocacy groups welcomed the release of the new framework, but pushed back on the voluntary nature of the new requirements, with Belgium-based finance reform NGO Finance Watch describing the move as “one step forward, two steps back.”\nJulia Symon, Head of Research and Advocacy at Finance Watch, said:\n“In the 2023 draft, banks would have been required to disclose greenhouse gas emissions no matter what. In the final version, they only need to do so if they consider those emissions financially material, and different banks will define materiality in different ways. On top of that, the final standard drops all disclosures related to banks’ capital markets and advisory activities.\n“We’re seeing one step forward, two steps back. As climate risks intensify, the momentum for coordinated action is fading. But climate change affects banks everywhere, and those banks are deeply interconnected. When one jurisdiction treats climate risks as optional, it raises financial stability risks for everyone.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.
