And we are looking forward with great interest for the upcoming summit between the European Union and Canada that we will be hosting in two weeks in Brussels,” Costa said.\nStory continues below advertisement\n“This is also a moment where we can strengthen Canada’s role in Europe’s rapidly evolving defence architecture,” said Von der Leyen.\n1:49\nCarney welcomes U.K.’s Starmer ahead of G7 summit\nThe 150-billion euro program is called Security Action for Europe, or SAFE. It’s part of the ReArm Europe initiative that Carney has said he wants Canada to join as he moves to shore up national defence.\nTrending Now\nFighter jets intercept civilian plane over Kananaskis during G7, RCMP says\nHundreds of protesters rally in downtown Calgary ahead of G7 summit\nGet daily National news\nGet the day's top news, political, economic, and current affairs headlines, delivered to your inbox once a day.\nSign up for daily National newsletter\nSign Up\nBy providing your email address, you have read and agree to Global News' Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\nVon der Leyen said the SAFE program can be joined by Europe’s “very close allies, friends and partners” and the deal this month will allow for negotiations on bringing Canada into the program.\nOttawa has been looking to partner with the European Union on defence as U.S. President Donald Trump continues to cast doubt on the future of the NATO military alliance.\nTrump has said that Washington won’t necessarily defend NATO allies, something analysts have called a threat that undermines the entire point of the alliance.\nStory continues below advertisement\nCanadian officials have sought to reduce their reliance on American gear — particularly since Trump mused in March about selling allies “toned-down” versions of fighter planes with fewer capabilities than U.S. aircraft.\nIn March, the European Commission unveiled ReArm Europe, a plan that would earmark up to the equivalent of C$1.25 trillion for defence over five years.\nIt’s a loan program that allows member states to take on more debt to spend on defence without triggering EU restrictions on members with excessive deficits.\nMore on Canada\nMore videos\nFighter jets intercept civilian plane over Kananaskis during G7, RCMP says\nCanada Strong Pass grants free admission to national parks, historic sites this summer\n3-year-old child killed after being hit by starting gate at N.B. horse race\nHome sales up 3.6% in May after ‘delayed’ start to peak season: CREA\nPolicing expert believes Nova Scotia kids’ disappearance is criminal investigation now\nCarney extends G7 invite to other countries — but is the cost worth the value?\nSurrey business owner holds public safety forum amid extortion threats\nCommunity steps in to deal with unclaimed human remains across Canada\nJournalistic standards\nComment\nReport an error\n© 2025 The Canadian Press\nSponsored content\nMore from Global News\nLiberal fast-track of major projects bill ‘new low,’ opposition MPs say\nWhy have gas prices gone up recently, and will they keep climbing?\nAdvertisement\nStay in the loop\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\nSign up for National newsletter\nSign Up\nTrending\nCarney, Trump aim for new deal on trade, security within 30 days at G7\n27,718\nRead\nHundreds of protesters rally in downtown Calgary ahead of G7 summit\n26,904\nRead\nSpanish locals shoot water at visitors in protests against mass tourism\n19,704\nRead\nFighter jets intercept civilian plane over Kananaskis during G7, RCMP says\n15,557\nRead\nItalian art museum calls out visitors who sat on crystal chair and broke it\n11,236\nRead\n3-year-old child killed after being hit by starting gate at N.B. horse race\n9,854\nRead\nTop Videos\nTrump says trade deal with Canada is ‘achievable’ as he meets with Carney\n251\nViewed\nG7 summit kicks off, Carney prepares for one-on-one with Trump\n183\nViewed\nDrake calls out former NDP leader for attending Kendrick Lamar concert\n82\nViewed\nThousands participate in anti-tourism protest in Barcelona with water pistols, smoke bombs\n54\nViewed\nCanadian fighter jets intercept civilian plane over Kananaskis during G7 summit\n48\nViewed\nTrump says trade deal with Canada is ‘achievable’ as he meets with Carney\nMore Videos\nStay in the loop\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\nSign up for National newsletter\nSign Up\nAdvertisement\nReport an Error\nSubscribe here\nAdChoices\nGlobal News Facebook Pages\nGlobal News Twitter Accounts\nGlobal News Youtube Channel\nGlobal News on Instagram\nGlobal News on LinkedIn\nGlobal News on TikTok\nGlobal News on Telegram\nGlobal News on BlueSky\nAbout\nPrinciples & Practices\nBranded Content\nContact us\nRSS\nNewsletters\nNotifications\nSmart home\nAdvertisers Election Registry\nGlobal News Licensing Requests\nCookie consent\n©2025 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

There were cheques that were stuck in the mail.”\nGet breaking National news\nFor news impacting Canada and around the world, sign up for breaking news alerts delivered directly to you when they happen.\nSign up for breaking National newsletter\nSign Up\nBy providing your email address, you have read and agree to Global News' Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\nThe other major food bank in Lethbridge, the Interfaith, said they were equally concerned at first, but found the mail service wasn’t as necessary as they thought.\n“While it did delay donations, we found that a lot of our donors adapted and found other means to give, primarily online, or people would come into the building to give us the cash right here on site,” said Danielle McIntyre, executive director of the Interfaith Food Bank.\nStory continues below advertisement\nFor her organization, this second strike comes during the largest summer fundraiser of the year, the annual “bakeless bake sale.” The Interfaith is hoping to raise $40,000 and McIntyre says she expects those who want to donate will do so, with or without Canada Post.\nThe same sentiment is echoed by Lazicki, who says once the transition is made, there is no reason to go back to paper mail.\n“It’s long-term. Once we switch over our suppliers to that form of payment, it’s easier for them, it’s easier for us.”\nMcIntyre says everything from newsletters to bills will be moved to paperless methods, even as their summer campaigns kick into high gear.\n“We will be adapting to ensure we can still communicate with our donors regardless of Canada Post’s activities.”\nRelated News\nSome businesses are already ditching Canada Post as strike looms\nCanada Post strike deadline looms\nCanada Post says no response from union on latest offer\nJournalistic standards\nComment\nReport an error\n© 2025 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.\nSponsored content\nMore from Global News\nCanada Post’s latest offer set to go to a vote by union members\nCanada Post rejects union’s arbitration proposal as ‘unacceptable’\nAdvertisement\nStay in the loop\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\nSign up for National newsletter\nSign Up\nTrending\nHundreds of protesters rally in downtown Calgary ahead of G7 summit\n25,113\nRead\nTrump says deal with Canada ‘achievable’ as he meets with Carney\n23,390\nRead\nSpanish locals shoot water at visitors in protests against mass tourism\n18,120\nRead\nFighter jets intercept civilian plane over Kananaskis during G7, RCMP says\n12,814\nRead\nItalian art museum calls out visitors who sat on crystal chair and broke it\n10,647\nRead\n3-year-old child killed after being hit by starting gate at N.B. horse race\n8,725\nRead\nTop Videos\nTrump says trade deal with Canada is ‘achievable’ as he meets with Carney\n233\nViewed\nG7 summit kicks off, Carney prepares for one-on-one with Trump\n199\nViewed\n‘Here for it:’ Fans welcome Kendrick Lamar to Toronto following Drake feud\n91\nViewed\nThousands participate in anti-tourism protest in Barcelona with water pistols, smoke bombs\n83\nViewed\nCanadian fighter jets intercept civilian plane over Kananaskis during G7 summit\n66\nViewed\nHousing minister says it will take time to fix Ontario’s low home building statistics\n55\nViewed\nMore Videos\nStay in the loop\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\nSign up for National newsletter\nSign Up\nAdvertisement\nReport an Error\nSubscribe here\nAdChoices\nGlobal News Facebook Pages\nGlobal News Twitter Accounts\nGlobal News Youtube Channel\nGlobal News on Instagram\nGlobal News on LinkedIn\nGlobal News on TikTok\nGlobal News on Telegram\nGlobal News on BlueSky\nAbout\nPrinciples & Practices\nBranded Content\nContact us\nRSS\nNewsletters\nNotifications\nSmart home\nAdvertisers Election Registry\nGlobal News Licensing Requests\nCookie consent\n©2025 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
