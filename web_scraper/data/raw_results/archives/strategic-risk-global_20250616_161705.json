And so are the fascinating conversations around risk priorities and strategies. But if we hope to take what we’ve learnt to the board, we need to be speaking their language.\nSR Q1 2025: Risk management – a kind of magic\nI’m sure organisations would love to wave a wand and eliminate the latest geopolitical tension, cyberattack threat or supply chain disruption. But instead they have risk managers, who weave their own magic spells to navigate their businesses past the perils that lurk around every corner\nSR Q4 2024: A resolution for change\nClosing out another rollercoaster year, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed and not exactly brimming with cheer. But risk managers are tougher than that. We continue to prove that this industry is the place for resilience, innovation and e ecting real change. Bring on 2025\nSR Q3 2024: The best laid plans…\nAs risk managers, we spend lots of time preparing for the worst. And yet, preparation can’t protect you from everything. When disaster strikes, sometimes the best you can do is keep smiling – even if it is through gritted teeth – and carry on, logging lessons for next time.\nSR Q2 2024: The great balancing act\nParenthood and risk management have a lot in common – both demand a superhuman ability to multitask, stay one step ahead, and keep a cool head. Every day is another challenge… but you wouldn’t change it for the world, right?\nSR Q1 2024: It’s tough out there, but we’ve got this\nIt sometimes feels like the world is spinning faster, as we are bombarded with ever-more complex and intertwining threats. It is the risk professional’s job to manage and mitigate, while guiding senior management through – no easy task. But with the right tools and information, we can do this.\nSR Q4 2023: It won’t be lonely this Christmas\nThe risk manager can be something of a lone wolf in an organisation – operating alone, often misunderstood. Thankfully, risk managers know where to find each other. Here’s to another year of collaborating, supporting and learning from our fellow loners.\nSR Q3 2023: Adapt or die\nAs the world of risk gets increasingly complex, there is a golden opportunity to elevate the profession beyond insurance buying, to strategic, value-adding, board-level ERM. Those risk managers who fail to step up and grab it with both hands may quickly become irrelevant.\nSR Q2 2023: Protecting your greatest asset\nNo risk is an island. And in this complex, interconnected risk landscape we are operating in, no risk department should be either. The health of our organisations and our people depends on building risk cultures that break silos and become truly cross-functional\nSR Q1 2023: Look out, listen out, speak out\nOne thing risk professionals know only too well is that history has a nasty habit of repeating itself\nSR Q4 2022: Thriving or surviving?\nAs we approach year-end, it is clear 2022 has offered no reprieve from shocks and cascading risks\nSR Q3 2022: Inflation - staying grounded\nEven the risk community isn’t keen on trying to predict the next crisis, as each one seems to have a cascade effect\nStrategicRISK Q2 2022: It just won’t wash\nOrganisations are racing to declare their sustainable credentials… but should they tread more carefully?\nStrategicRISK Airmic 2022: Sink or swim\nTaking ESG responsibilities seriously could help build greater resilience. This, and much more, in our special Airmic edition\nStrategicRISK Q1 2022: Our world in pain\nThe world needs more adults in the room who are willing to speak up and behave with intellect, diplomacy and integrity through a crisis\nStrategicRISK Q4 2021: The great reset\nRisk management is not just about avoiding losses. It is about saying ‘yes’ when it counts\nStrategicRISK Q3 2021: Comply or explain\nCompanies are being told ‘no more greenwashing’ as governments and activist shareholders push the zero-carbon agenda\nStrategicRISK Q2 2021: Stronger together\nWe all learned a lot in the past year. Now it’s time to take that into the latest redesign of work life.\nStrategicRISK Q1 2021: A slice of the pie\nLike so many of us, capitalism kicked off 2021 with something of an existential crisis. Is it time to call time on short-termism?\nStrategicRISK Q4 2020: Twenty years in risk!\nWhen StrategicRISK was born, few could have anticipated the world of risks we would be facing 20 years on\nStrategicRISK Q3 2020: A more mindful business\nAs lockdown restrictions lift, organisations must carefully manage the safety, mental health and wellbeing of their staff. It’s the right thing to do, and it’s good for business.\nStrategicRISK Australia: 2020 edition\nIt is time to show that risk managers are essential partners and business enablers within our organisations as we navigate these challenging times\nStrategicRISK Q2 2020: Our time to shine\nNew risk realities arising in the post-COVID world will demand very new risk solutions.

But in a social media-led world where fake news works so hard to be king, how do we avoid getting burned? Because the most crucial messages could be lost if we can’t discern the facts from the fiction\nStrategicRISK Europe Q2 2019: Our world at war\nUS versus China, UK versus Europe – how can companies navigate the numerous political battle lines being drawn around the globe?\nStrategicRISK Europe Q1 2019: Let’s head to the wild side\nWe want our #ChangingRisk campaign to inspire you to rethink old practices, push past common misconceptions and help elevate risk management to its full potential.

26 JUNE @ 2:00PM | VIRTUAL\nTopic | Climate Resilience: Rethinking Risk in a world of Natural Catastrophes\nThe threat of natural catastrophes and climate risk is reshaping global business resilience.\nThe rising frequency and severity of extreme weather events (hurricanes, wildfires, floods, and heatwaves) pose a growing threat to businesses and economies. The financial and operational impacts are significant, affecting supply chains, infrastructure, and workforce safety.\nTraditional risk models struggle with unpredictable weather patterns and shifting regulations, forcing companies to embed climate resilience into their strategies as climate risk is ever evolving.\nInsurance markets are also adapting, with rising premiums, capacity constraints, and changing coverage terms making risk transfer more challenging.\nIf you would like to learn more about being an SR.500 Exchange partner, please contact:\nEmmanuel Arthur\nCommercial Lead\n+44 (0)20 7832 2327\nemmanuel.arthur@nqsm.com\nParticipation is by invitation.

How can clients, brokers and insurers navigate these challenges?\nWhat are the biggest challenges related to power requirements and regional grid limitations?\nHow can data centres balance the demand for power with the need for sustainability?\nWhat are the most significant risks facing data centres today?\nHow can clients, brokers, and insurers collaborate to mitigate these risks effectively?\nWhat are the primary concerns of clients and brokers regarding data centre insurance?\nHow can insurers better support clients and brokers in navigating these challenges?\nIf you would like to learn more about being an SR.500 Exchange partner, please contact:\nEmmanuel Arthur\nCommercial Lead\n+44 (0)20 7832 2327\nemmanuel.arthur@nqsm.com\nParticipation is by invitation.

From AI to the internet of things - the possibilities are endless. But what role do risk managers play in both identifying the threats of digital transformation, and enabling the organisations they work for to be nimble and innovate. How can they manage emerging risks such as more sophisticated cyber attacks, challenges around employees using AI, and digital skills shortages. This roundtable will discuss how senior risk professionals are thinking about digital transformation, and the steps they are taking to stay on the front foot in a fast-changing world.\nIf you would like to learn more about being an SR.500 Exchange partner, please contact:\nEmmanuel Arthur\nCommercial Lead\n+44 (0)20 7832 2327\nemmanuel.arthur@nqsm.com\nParticipation is by invitation.

Rapid advancements have outpaced the current workforce’s capabilities, leading to a shortage of qualified professionals in areas such as artificial intelligence, data science, and cybersecurity.\nHigh turnover rates further compound these challenges. Employees are considering job changes, often due to gaps in employee benefits and dissatisfaction with current compensation structures. This creates significant risks around talent retention, as organisations struggle to maintain a stable and committed workforce.\nThis roundtable featured in our Q2 2025 edition:\nRead the People Risk Roundtable article\nRead the full edition\nIf you would like to learn more about being an SR.500 Exchange partner, please contact:\nEmmanuel Arthur\nCommercial Lead\n+44 (0)20 7832 2327\nemmanuel.arthur@nqsm.com\nParticipation is by invitation.

spark, but lithium-ion battery risks run deeper. At Airmic 2025, Marsh’s Alistair Schuberth gave a briefing on what risk managers need to know\nLithium-ion battery risks are often dismissed by businesses who assume they don’t apply unless a fleet of electric vehicles (EVs) is in use. But this misconception can blindside organisations to hidden threats.\n“I still routinely sit with clients and we talk about lithium-ion battery risk. And they instantly dismiss it because they don’t run electric cars or they don’t run electric lorries,” said Alistair Schuberth, risk partner at Marsh Corporate, UK, speaking at the Airmic conference. “When we raise it in the context of other devices that may exist within their business, their eyes start to go a little bit wider.”\nFrom vapes to forklifts to solar panel storage, lithium-ion batteries are now embedded across organisation, often without central oversight. Fires, supply chain disruptions, and liability issues are all on the rise.\nThe risks: thermal runaway and beyond\nWhile media headlines focus on dramatic EV fires, it’s important to distinguish between battery types and use cases.\n“Generally no one is saying lithium-ion batteries in and of themselves are inherently dangerous. The thermal runaway is the big problem in terms of property damage,” Schuberth clarified. This refers to a chain reaction caused by battery damage, faulty software, overcharging or manufacturing defects.\nAlthough EV fires get the headlines, incidents can involve mobile phones, scooters, power tools and even solar installations. Charging practices are particularly sensitive. Fires often occur during charging, when battery control systems fail or are bypassed.\nPoor storage is another issue. Batteries can fail and spark fire if stored incorrectly, particularly in bulk. And the consequences may not be limited to property: cable trip hazards, electrocution risks, supply chain disruption, reputational damage and regulatory scrutiny are all potential outcomes.\nWhere lithium risks are hiding\nThe first step is identifying where lithium-ion batteries are already in use:\nConsumer electronics: mobile phones, laptops, vapes, scooters, e-bikes\nVehicles: EVs, company car fleets, forklifts, ride-on units\nEnergy storage: battery units connected to photovoltaic (PV) solar panels\nCritical machinery: robotics, drones, warehouse equipment\nThe risk manager’s job is to surface and catalogue this use. Location, storage method, quantity, battery type and charging behaviour all matter.\nStorage and charging: red flags and best practice\nInsurer expectations are evolving quickly. While battery concerns were once niche, they are now mainstream for risk engineers conducting site visits.\n“Five years ago, you say you’ve got electric vehicles… you won’t raise an eyebrow in an inspection… Now, I’m starting to see a lot more questions forthcoming from engineers,” Schuberth said.\nRisk managers should take care with where batteries are stored and charged. Common red flags include:\nBatteries stored near fire exits or escape routes\nCharging units propped on combustible materials (e.g. wooden pallets)\nDevices charging unattended overnight\nAccumulated devices stored without fire separation\nInsurers typically want at least two metres of clearance from combustibles, and for bulk batteries, 60+ minutes of fireproof enclosure. Ideal storage is outdoors, away from the main building.\nFor bulk storage, insurers often expect fireproof enclosures and ideally, a “sacrificial building” isolated from core assets.\nInspections and reporting culture\nA regular inspection regime is essential. But it must go beyond box-ticking.\nBuilding an open reporting culture is key. If a battery-powered vehicle has been in an accident or knocked, it’s important staff feel safe reporting the incident so that potential damage to the battery can be investigated and risks mitigated.\nVisual checks for damage, bulging, or battery alerts are a minimum standard. In some cases, off-gas detection systems (which sense early chemical release before visible smoke) can offer early warning. These can be integrated into fire alarms and are relatively low-cost.\nBusiness continuity and supply chain shocks\nFire is not the only concern. Business continuity and supply chain resilience are just as crucial.\nMany battery components come from a small number of global manufacturers, largely based in China and South Korea. Schuberth cited past shocks from the Ukraine conflict as evidence of how quickly disruption can cascade. “I had no idea so much from the automotive industry came from Ukraine,” he admitted.\nA single battery failure could immobilise machinery and delay operations—especially if replacements have multi-month lead times. Risk managers should identify dependencies, map supply chains (ideally using automation tools), and develop continuity plans.\nLiability and legal obligations\nUnder the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, businesses are legally required to maintain up-to-date fire risk assessments. Yet many are still overlooking lithium-ion battery risks.\n“Most of the organisations I work with, I don’t think they have up-to-date fire risk assessments,” Schuberth said. “It doesn’t have to be a major point, but it should acknowledge the presence of lithium-ion batteries and show how you’re managing it.”\nInsurers are also scrutinising compliance with DSEAR (Dangerous Substances and Explosive Atmospheres Regulations) if batteries are being charged indoors. Even without enforcement, the message is clear: proactive documentation matters.\nThe forgotten risks: e-scooters, vapes and grey space\nMicro-mobility and consumer items pose a different kind of problem: invisibility.\nStaff may bring in e-scooters or rent them for the last mile, parking them in back corridors or near fire exits. These small devices are often powered by poor-quality or aftermarket batteries with no verifiable safety standards. The risk multiplies when multiple units are stored or charged together.\nEven waste disposal creates issues. “Disposable vapes going into a compactor is a big problem for the waste industry,” Schuberth said. Crushing damaged lithium batteries in waste streams can cause fires, particularly when mixed with flammable material.\nHow to respond: practical steps\nKnow where batteries are used: Create an asset inventory, even for small devices.\nReview storage and charging protocols: Keep batteries away from combustibles, and never charge overnight unattended.\nUpdate fire risk assessments: Include lithium-ion risks explicitly.\nTrain staff and encourage reporting: Build a culture of openness around equipment damage.\nInstall early detection: Off-gas sensors can detect failures before fires erupt.\nPrepare continuity plans: Account for the impact of fire or loss of critical battery-dependent kit.\nAudit your supply chain: Understand where key components originate and plan alternatives.\nA new era of scrutiny and insurer expectations\nSchuberth warned against treating battery risks as new or obscure. While lithium-ion technology may feel cutting-edge, its risk profile is now well established. Insurers want to support the green transition, he explained, but also want to ensure appropriate controls are in place to prevent large-scale property losses like warehouse fires.\nEarly engagement with insurers and brokers is vital, especially when installing new infrastructure like EV chargers or solar panels. Demonstrating informed, proactive management can make the difference between affordable cover and declined quotes.\nWhile UK legislation is catching up (a Lithium-ion Battery Safety Bill is progressing through Parliament), it is risk managers who must lead the charge now.\nFrom city centre pedicabs to logistics fleets and warehoused power tools, lithium-ion battery exposure is everywhere. Managing it well can reduce the chance of fire, protect supply chains, and demonstrate organisational resilience to insurers and stakeholders alike.\n“Insurers want to enable you to be able to do this… but what we all want is to make sure the building doesn’t burn down,” Schuberth said in closing.\nNo comments\nBLOG: Airmic Conference 2025 Daily News Summary\n1\nBLOG: Airmic Conference 2025 Daily News Summary\n2\nCaptives will relocate to the UK, confirms Airmic CEO\n3\nAirmic 2025: Five lessons for risk managers from Charles Hecker\n4\nAirmic 2025: Geopolitics dominates, but strategic clarity is the real challenge\n5\nAirmic 2025: AI will demand new skills from risk managers and underwriters\n6\nAirmic 2025: Employers urged to stay ahead of rising travel risks\n7\nAirmic 2025: A geopolitics survival guide for risk managers\n8\nCaptives gain ground as Airmic hints at Treasury’s next move\n9\nAirmic 2025: AI, cyber risk and trust: how risk managers can keep pace with fast-moving threats\n10\nAirmic 2025: US in fiscal cliff danger as global economic risk rises\n11\nTake the long view as tariffs bite, says financial chief Charles Brindamour\n12\nCurrently reading\nAirmic 2025: The truth about lithium-ion battery risks and how to manage them\n13\nAirmic 2025: How risk managers are thinking about the threats they face\n14\nGlobal strength, local delivery\n15\nMeet the Airmic shadow board chair: Network Rail’s Taiwo Omo-Ikerodah\n16\nFacing into risk: Interconnected threats demand a smarter, faster response from risk managers\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nMore Fire\nBriefing: Soaring EV sales spark new underwriting concerns over fire risks\nHow EV fires sparked fears, supply chain tensions, and a reputational blaze\nSpotlight on: risk management strategies to tackle Lithium-ion battery fire threats\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

artificial intelligence transforms the cyber threat landscape, risk professionals must learn to translate technical risks into boardroom strategy and ensure their organisations are prepared for what’s next. Experts from government, underwriting and cyber security explain how.\nArtificial intelligence is advancing rapidly – and so are the threats. From deepfakes to self-learning malware and autonomous attacks, AI is enabling cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities faster and with greater precision than ever before.\nSpeaking at the Airmic conference, Kirsty Kelly, global CISO at CFC, warned that the pace of change is creating new risks that many security teams are still scrambling to understand. ”This is AI generated cyber attacks that are happening now. AI is going to be able to do this in the future at a speed and scale we can’t comprehend yet,” she said.\nShe described a recent phishing attack in which she was the only person targeted in her company, highlighting how AI can fuel highly personalised, persistent attempts at fraud and manipulation. These attacks are not only more convincing but also more difficult to detect using traditional controls.\nIn addition to AI-powered phishing and malware, Kelly warned of other growing threats. “Deepfakes are one that really concern me… Deepfake technology gets better by the day… [and] that’s quite a terrifying prospect because it can and will be weaponised,” she said. “The future of cyber warfare is AI against AI.”\nFrom defensive to predictive\nTo stay ahead, Kelly is collaborating with vendors to implement AI-powered defences capable of anticipating and countering threats.\nAutomated incident response is one area where AI can deliver significant benefits, allowing security teams to isolate affected systems, begin forensics and respond in real time,  even outside working hours. But trust and control are critical.\n“I certainly don’t want AI to go off and make a bunch of decisions that I wouldn’t make,” Kelly said. “And I think that’s really important… How is AI behaving and how can we trust it.”\nFrom a policy perspective, John Maguire, head of cyber resilience and incentives at DSIT, said the UK government is working to ensure AI adoption is both innovative and secure. “This government is really prioritising growth, but we really recognise that growth and innovation needs to be safe and secure. It needs to needs to be protected,” he explained.\nHe highlighted the publication of the UK’s AI cyber security code of practice, which offers guidance to both developers and users. The code includes measures such as cybersecurity training, risk assessment procedures and recovery planning tailored to AI systems. The UK has submitted the code to ETSI as a basis for international standards.\nMaguire also emphasised the need for board-level engagement on digital risk. “Digital risk should now be considered as seen as any other sort of core business risk, like you would manage your financial risk or legal risk or anything like that,” he said. He pointed to recent incidents, including a cyberattack on Marks & Spencer, as evidence that these risks carry significant business impacts.\nInsurers push for visibility and speed\nTom Draper, UK managing director at Coalition, argued that insurers can play a key role in closing the knowledge gap. “Urgency when it comes to innovation is your ability to learn and move,” he said. “You can’t have innovation without speed.”\nCoalition has adopted an ‘active insurance’ model, sending real-time alerts to clients about potential vulnerabilities. “Last year we sent out nearly 47,000 alerts to our customers saying, look, here are the things that we are seeing being hit. And by the way, you have this problem too. Can we help you do something about it?”\nFor Draper, visibility is essential, both across client systems and in the wider ecosystem. Insurers need to push insights not only to risk and IT teams but also to business decision-makers who may be unaware of how AI changes the risk profile of their operations.\nLooking ahead, he believes the insurance sector must do more to support risk prevention. “We need to be pushing further down in terms of helping those teams - and not just the risk, legal and security teams, but the business operations teams as well.”\nMeanwhile, with AI evolving faster than most companies can keep up with, risk managers must act as translators – helping boards understand technical threats in business terms and guiding responsible adoption.\n“Translation is key,” Draper said. “These are conversations every firm is having internally. It’s just being pushed by different teams. It’s being pushed by marketing, it’s being pushed by customer service, it’s being pushed by operations. Helping that internal translation, I think, is where risk leaders can really add value.”\nBoards must also be incentivised to pay attention. As Maguire put it: “Quite often there’s a lack of senior ownership of the risk. Actually, industry has said: we need to understand what good looks like.”\nBy shaping standards, improving communication and driving AI awareness into decision-making, risk managers can keep their organisations on the front foot.\nNo comments\nBLOG: Airmic Conference 2025 Daily News Summary\n1\nBLOG: Airmic Conference 2025 Daily News Summary\n2\nCaptives will relocate to the UK, confirms Airmic CEO\n3\nAirmic 2025: Five lessons for risk managers from Charles Hecker\n4\nAirmic 2025: Geopolitics dominates, but strategic clarity is the real challenge\n5\nAirmic 2025: AI will demand new skills from risk managers and underwriters\n6\nAirmic 2025: Employers urged to stay ahead of rising travel risks\n7\nAirmic 2025: A geopolitics survival guide for risk managers\n8\nCaptives gain ground as Airmic hints at Treasury’s next move\n9\nCurrently reading\nAirmic 2025: AI, cyber risk and trust: how risk managers can keep pace with fast-moving threats\n10\nAirmic 2025: US in fiscal cliff danger as global economic risk rises\n11\nTake the long view as tariffs bite, says financial chief Charles Brindamour\n12\nAirmic 2025: The truth about lithium-ion battery risks and how to manage them\n13\nAirmic 2025: How risk managers are thinking about the threats they face\n14\nGlobal strength, local delivery\n15\nMeet the Airmic shadow board chair: Network Rail’s Taiwo Omo-Ikerodah\n16\nFacing into risk: Interconnected threats demand a smarter, faster response from risk managers\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nMore AIRMIC 2025\nCaptives will relocate to the UK, confirms Airmic CEO\nAirmic 2025: Five lessons for risk managers from Charles Hecker\nAirmic 2025: Geopolitics dominates, but strategic clarity is the real challenge\nAirmic 2025: AI will demand new skills from risk managers and underwriters\nAirmic 2025: Employers urged to stay ahead of rising travel risks\nAirmic 2025: A geopolitics survival guide for risk managers\nLoad more articles\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

risk managers\nAIRMIC 2025\nAirmic 2025: Five lessons for risk managers from Charles Hecker\n2025-06-11T12:21:00+01:00\nNo comments\nAt Airmic, geopolitical expert Charles Hecker urged risk managers to abandon outdated assumptions and prepare for a world defined by constant disruption\nAs global alliances fracture, international institutions lose authority, and conflict increasingly impacts business operations, risk managers face a stark new reality. The era of relative geopolitical stability is over – and it is not coming back.\nInstead, organisations must operate in a world defined by unpredictability, power fragmentation, and escalating economic and political friction. Navigating this volatility is no longer the job of diplomats alone. It is now central to corporate strategy, risk management, and long-term value protection.\nAt Airmic’s annual conference, geopolitical expert and author Charles Hecker delivered a direct message to the profession: the rules of the global game have changed – and risk leaders must change with them.\nIn a wide-ranging conversation with Airmic CMO Alexander Frost, Hecker dissected the forces reshaping international affairs and outlined the mindset shift risk professionals must embrace to stay ahead. Here are five strategic lessons from the session, and what they mean for today’s corporate risk agenda.\n1. The world won’t “settle down” – prepare for sustained disruption\nRisk managers often assume that today’s geopolitical chaos is a blip – that eventually, a new equilibrium will emerge. But Hecker urged a rethink. The instability we’re experiencing may not be transitional. It may be the new normal.\n“I think we have to try to figure out one of two things. And that is, are we in a period of incredible disruption… or is this period of disruption, this discomfort, this lack of familiar trappings – is this the new status quo?”\nHe warned against “recency bias” – the human tendency to believe the current moment is uniquely bad – but said this should not distract from the real dangers: political unpredictability, the breakdown of international norms, and the erosion of trust between states.\nTakeaway: Risk functions must stop waiting for clarity. Build strategies that assume prolonged uncertainty. Design flexible decision-making frameworks that can operate in multiple, conflicting realities.\n2. Globalisation is retreating – and the consequences are accelerating\nFor decades, businesses benefited from the logic of open markets, stable trade agreements and global institutions. But those foundations are eroding. Trade wars, sanctions, political intervention and supply chain fragmentation are now business-as-usual.\n“Globalisation is under enormous pressure,” said Hecker. “It’s now contracting a lot faster and a lot more violently than we thought it would.”\nHe argued that earlier ideas like nearshoring, friendshoring or de-risking now seem “quaint,” given how quickly economic nationalism has hardened. Attempts to realign supply chains come with far greater pain – politically and financially – than many organisations anticipated.\nThe result is a world where regional trade blocs and security alliances no longer overlap, where friends and rivals shift depending on sector, and where assumptions about openness must be continually revisited.\nTakeaway: Map your supply chain and investment footprint against political volatility, not just economic opportunity. Identify where exposure to geopolitical risk is no longer tolerable – and where resilience must be prioritised.\n3. Political risk is no longer just “over there” – it’s at home too\nRisk managers often treat political instability as something that happens far away – in “frontier” or “emerging” markets. But Hecker warned that Western democracies are no longer immune. In fact, some are among the most unpredictable.\n“The United States is now a personality-driven jurisdiction. It’s no longer driven by its political institutions… the predictability goes out the window.”\nThis shift, he explained, destabilises global governance as a whole. When a former anchor state becomes erratic, international institutions lose authority, trade becomes transactional, and treaties are increasingly short-term.\nAnd this dynamic extends beyond the US. Brexit demonstrated that even markets perceived as “safe” can behave in politically disruptive ways. Europe is now one of the busiest portfolios for geopolitical analysts – a far cry from its recent past.\nTakeaway: Don’t silo political risk into foreign affairs. Factor domestic political volatility – including regulation, polarisation and institutional fragility – into core strategic and compliance planning.\n4. Scenario planning is your best defence – but only if you do it right\nForecasting has failed. That was Hecker’s blunt message to risk managers. From the invasion of Ukraine to the fall of Kabul, from Brexit to the pandemic, many of the biggest geopolitical shocks of recent years caught forecasters off guard.\n“The only thing that we’re getting these days is outliers that we haven’t prepared for. So forecasting in its own way is setting a trap.”\nHecker urged organisations to abandon likelihood-based forecasting and instead invest in robust scenario planning. The key is not to predict the future, but to build resilience across a range of plausible futures – best case, worst case, and everything in between.\nTakeaway: Move away from single-point risk assessments. Develop contrasting geopolitical scenarios and test your business model against each – even the uncomfortable ones.\n5. Never stop challenging assumptions – even in “safe” markets\nPerhaps Hecker’s most urgent warning was the need to rethink how companies engage with the countries they operate in. Drawing on his research into Western businesses in post-Soviet Russia, he reflected on how optimism and success can cloud judgement.\n“Companies tend to look at countries as markets, and they overlook the fact that countries are political and geopolitical animals and will behave according to rules that don’t necessarily follow the same laws as markets.”\nIn boom times, he explained, firms stop reassessing their strategic assumptions. In Russia, many organisations “drank a little bit of their own Kool-Aid” – letting the profits roll in without confronting the changing political context. By the time risk crystallised, it was too late.\nHecker argued this mindset applies not just to Russia or China, but to every jurisdiction – including democracies. “We used to have a Europe analyst who… was able to sleep at his desk all day long,” he joked. “Europe analysts now are some of the busiest geopolitical risk analysts in the world.”\nTakeaway: Establish a regular cadence of geopolitical stress-testing across all markets – not just those deemed risky. Success is not a substitute for scrutiny.\nFrom strategic fog to structured resilience\nAs Hecker concluded, the biggest danger for businesses is not just external shocks – it’s clinging to outdated tools and mindsets. The future will not be defined by clarity or stability, but by ambiguity and acceleration. Risk managers who embrace that reality will be best placed to lead.\n“We’ve had this complete inversion of where risk lives… I’m sure for almost all of us, risk used to reside in the future,” he explained. “The problem… is that risk now resides in the immediate future and that’s something we’re not accustomed to.”\nThis shift demands more than just a philosophical adjustment, it requires a tactical rethink of how risk functions operate. Long-term scenario planning must now be accompanied by short-cycle monitoring, rapid escalation protocols, and pre-agreed action playbooks. Immediacy changes everything, from how organisations absorb news, to how boards are briefed, how crises are detected, and how quickly responses are deployed.\nIn this environment, resilience is no longer about bouncing back – it’s about seeing around corners, adapting to parallel realities, and knowing that geopolitical shocks are not “if,” but “when.”\nNo comments\nBLOG: Airmic Conference 2025 Daily News Summary\n1\nBLOG: Airmic Conference 2025 Daily News Summary\n2\nCaptives will relocate to the UK, confirms Airmic CEO\n3\nCurrently reading\nAirmic 2025: Five lessons for risk managers from Charles Hecker\n4\nAirmic 2025: Geopolitics dominates, but strategic clarity is the real challenge\n5\nAirmic 2025: AI will demand new skills from risk managers and underwriters\n6\nAirmic 2025: Employers urged to stay ahead of rising travel risks\n7\nAirmic 2025: A geopolitics survival guide for risk managers\n8\nCaptives gain ground as Airmic hints at Treasury’s next move\n9\nAirmic 2025: AI, cyber risk and trust: how risk managers can keep pace with fast-moving threats\n10\nAirmic 2025: US in fiscal cliff danger as global economic risk rises\n11\nTake the long view as tariffs bite, says financial chief Charles Brindamour\n12\nAirmic 2025: The truth about lithium-ion battery risks and how to manage them\n13\nAirmic 2025: How risk managers are thinking about the threats they face\n14\nGlobal strength, local delivery\n15\nMeet the Airmic shadow board chair: Network Rail’s Taiwo Omo-Ikerodah\n16\nFacing into risk: Interconnected threats demand a smarter, faster response from risk managers\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nMore AIRMIC 2025\nCaptives will relocate to the UK, confirms Airmic CEO\nAirmic 2025: Geopolitics dominates, but strategic clarity is the real challenge\nAirmic 2025: AI will demand new skills from risk managers and underwriters\nAirmic 2025: Employers urged to stay ahead of rising travel risks\nAirmic 2025: A geopolitics survival guide for risk managers\nCaptives gain ground as Airmic hints at Treasury’s next move\nLoad more articles\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

Here are the five biggest risks to put on your agenda\nToday’s risk managers face a multitude of evolving threats, characterised by geopolitical tensions, technological disruptions, and increasingly severe climate events.\nUnderstanding and mitigating these risks is crucially important for business resilience but doing so means risk managers must be highly vigilant, both to spot the key emerging threats and evaluate their impact on organisations.\nMichael Gregory, director of underwriting strategy UK&I at RSA said: “There are really thought-provoking risks out there, and really interesting things going on that are big for society, but if they’re not impacting your business, then you shouldn’t worry too much about them.”\nSo, what are the key threats that should be on the risk manager’s agenda?\n1) Geopolitical tensions\nGeopolitical uncertainty remains a pivotal concern for businesses. Meanwhile, the fracturing of global trade into distinct blocs poses challenges for businesses dependent on international supply chains.\nGregory says: “We’ve got the ongoing war in Ukraine, the tensions in the South China Sea which keep bubbling, and other geopolitical hotspots around the world. These can disrupt supply chains, increase energy prices, create political instability, and cause issues with migration. This is not just happening in the areas that are in the mainstream media. It’s happening all around the world.”\nRisk managers need to evaluate how these dynamics affect their supply chains and implement robust strategies to ensure resilience across diverse regions. This means managing not just the immediate effects of geopolitical risks, but also the long-term implications. Building resilient supply chains, securing energy resources, and crafting adaptive strategies are all critically important to maintain stability.\n2) Economic Uncertainty\nEconomic uncertainty remains a big concern for risk managers globally as businesses grapple with potential stagflation, high borrowing costs, and varying economic strategies across nations.\nGregory said: “Most areas of the world are comfortable that they’ve got inflation under control, but the big question is have they really [succeeded]? High borrowing costs are impacting business investment and there is potential for recessions. We’re seeing that in the UK, and certainly across areas of Europe, we’ve got countries such as Germany and France who economies are struggling at the moment. The risk of rising tariffs, whether that’s from the US or China or other nations is quite monumental.”\nBusinesses must reassess their risk management strategies, focusing on the immediate risks with the greatest potential for disruption. Better collaboration with insurance carriers, not just for risk transfer, but for insight, means that risk managers can better insulate against market volatility, ensuring sustained growth.\n3) Cybersecurity Threats\nCybersecurity threats have become increasingly sophisticated, posing significant risks to businesses of all sizes. And while technology disruption in the form of artificial intelligence (AI) can unlock opportunities, it also introduces significant challenges.\n“Technology has advanced so rapidly,” explains Gregory “and it continues to do so. That creates a huge amount of opportunity, but it could also completely disrupt business models and create risks if the right safeguards are not in place.\n“We’re getting to a point where artificial intelligence is scraping artificial intelligence for information. So, where do you draw the line … It’s all well and good to invest in artificial intelligence, but if your people don’t know how to use it properly, the risks are severe.”\nFrom a risk management perspective, the interplay between opportunity and threat requires a high level of understanding. And risk managers must ensure employees are equipped with the knowledge and tools to effectively leverage AI.\nFrom a cybersecurity perspective, maintaining up-to-date prevention methods, employee training and insurance coverage is essential to protect against potential disruptions and financial losses.\n4) Climate Change and Extreme Weather\nClimate change remains one of the most pressing challenges for this generation, manifesting in increasingly frequent and severe weather events. Recent events such as the wildfires in California and devastating floods across Asia and Europe, demonstrate the severe risks that companies, populations, and governments are facing.\nGregory says: “The advent of extreme weather events is becoming more potent. We’re witnessing phenomena like storm surges, heatwaves, and floods causing unprecedented destruction. The key is to understand what resilience looks like for businesses and communities. Are they in a position to withstand multiple events or significant shifts in climate patterns?”\nWhile many businesses have robust insurance protecting against physical damage due to extreme weather, there is a significant gap in proactive risk mitigation and non-damage business interruption. Risk managers must assess the potential impact of climate on infrastructure and human resources, especially in regions prone to extreme weather.\n5) Social and Political Unrest\nSocial and political unrest has become an ever-present risk for businesses and governments alike.\nGregory says: “We’ve witnessed waves of social and political unrest over the last couple of years, and I would be shocked if we don’t see more. This stems from the populism sweeping across the globe and the division in thought on whether governments or corporations are fulfilling their obligations responsibly. Activism, too, is on the rise.”\nThis can lead to both business disruption and reputational damage. Understanding how your company’s association with certain socio-political stances could be perceived is critical. And this landscape evolves with lightning speed, which means that businesses need to adapt quickly.\nRisk managers play a vital role in guiding organisations through this increasingly turbulent environment. By understanding the nuances beneath risks and aligning strategies accordingly, businesses can not only survive but thrive in today’s complex world.\nNo comments\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nMore Emerging Risks\nDeep dive: how businesses can build resilience against black swan events\nQuick briefing: what are space weather risks and how can organisations manage them\nWEF global risk report: Businesses face escalating environmental, geopolitical, social, and technology challenges\nSpotlight on: construction risks in the education sector\nSpotlight on: the unique risks facing dating app providers\nOpinion: Risk managers must “keep calm and innovate on” to harness the power of AI\nLoad more articles\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

Here’s what risk managers need to know\nGlobal businesses are accelerating energy transition plans due to concerns delays will come at a huge cost.\nAs leaders from 60 countries attended a major conference in London to identify how best to map a sustainable energy future, experts warned that the world’s energy systems were still vulnerable to shocks.\nA landmark global poll of business executives across 15 countries highlighted overwhelming support for a rapid transition away from fossil fuels to renewable electricity.\nCommissioned by E3G, the study highlighted a global tipping point with 97% of mid-market and large company leaders backing a move away from coal and other fossil fuels, with nearly 78% supporting the shift to a renewables based electricity system by 2035 or sooner.\nMore pressure on governments\nThe report found that the majority businesses will look to relocate to countries who take the lead in renewable energy delivery - highlighting the urgent need for governments to act.\nThe study revealed half of business leaders said they will relocate their operations (52%) and supply chains (49%) to markets with better access to renewables-based power systems within five years.\nThe We Mean Business Coalition said that as world leaders finalise their next round of national climate plans (NDCs), the message from business is unequivocal - renewable energy is the best path to economic growth, energy security, and long-term competitiveness.\nMany businesses believe government policy is lagging.\nThe survey found despite strong corporate backing; many governments lack clear transition plans. In Japan business leaders say they want clarity on renewable electricity’s role within the country’s climate plans, highlighting corporate uncertainty in the investment outlook of Japan’s future power mix.\nIn Canada, where mine closures risk damaging communities, companies are urging workforce reskilling and targeted incentives.\nNick Mabey, CEO, E3G said: “In contrast to much political commentary this global poll shows nearly 80% of business executives strongly support a rapid transition to renewable power systems in the next decade.\n“Business also wants stronger government policies to facilitate the shift to renewable electricity, access to which is a top priority when deciding where to invest. This strong endorsement of the economic and security benefits of renewables should give governments confidence to set ambitious, 1.5 degree aligned NDCs ahead of COP30.”\nKey statistics\nThree-quarters (75%) of executives associate renewables with stronger energy security and 77% say they lead to economic growth, while 75% see them as key to job creation.\nNearly nine in ten (87%) of business executives who want their government to prioritise investment in renewables want them to stop using coal-fired electricity within the next decade.\nMore than two-fifths (43%) of mid-sized and large businesses plan to transition away from using coal within their own operations by 2030, with over one quarter (27%) intending to follow suit by 2035.\nWhy businesses must act now\nBusiness leaders are investing in renewables and would like to do more. They need governments to accelerate planning and the removal of permitting delays for renewable energy, storage and grids.\nStuart Lemmon, global head of practices, sustainability, Schneider Electric Sustainability Business, Schneider Electric said: “Companies embracing renewable energy today are positioning themselves to succeed tomorrow - driving greater competitiveness, accelerating innovation and unlocking long-term cost savings.\n“Renewable energy isn’t merely good sustainability practice; it’s an essential strategy for businesses committed to growth, resilience and long-term success.”\nGonzalo Sáenz de Miera, director of climate change and alliances at Iberdrola said: “A rapid shift from fossil fuels to renewable power and electrification makes strong business sense and ensures energy security and resilience.\n“Enabling policy environments for investments in clean energy, grids and storage; market mechanisms and long-term contracts to provide price stability; and an acceleration of permitting for projects will be paramount to this aim.”\nAnd Alice Steenland, chief strategy, sustainability and marketing officer, Signify said: “At Signify, we’re already moving away from fossil fuels and sourcing electricity from renewables, while increasing the energy efficiency of our lighting products. This combination – renewables plus energy efficiency – will reduce carbon emissions, lower costs for households and companies, and create millions of local, clean energy jobs.”\nNext steps\nThe survey presented a number of recommendations for policymakers which identified the needs of business when it came to their energy future.\nIt called for:\nClear incentives for renewable energy projects, including financing mechanisms and tax credits.\nRobust roadmaps for national transition, ensuring that the shift is both rapid and strategic.\nInvestible NDCs that provide thought-through policy frameworks for the phase out of fossil fuels and upscaling of renewables, that in turn offer long-term stability for corporate decision-making.\nWorkforce retraining and job creation plans, particularly in coal-heavy economies, to ensure a just transition.\nMaria Mendiluce, CEO, We Mean Business Coalition concluded: “The shift away from fossil fuels is no longer a debate - it is an economic reality driven by companies that recognise clean energy as the foundation for long-term competitive advantage, job creation, and energy price stability.\n“The business determination to build a clean energy system is a great opportunity for countries to attract investment and growth. Governments and companies need to work together, reskilling the workforce to benefit from new jobs opportunities.”\nNo comments\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

We analyse the key takeaways for risk managers\nThe world is experiencing a nature crisis, with one million of the estimated eight million species of plants and animals in the world at risk of extinction and around 75% of the Earth’s land surface significantly altered by human actions.\nTo help risk managers battle this crisis, AXA XL, in partnership with Nature Positive, has launched a new report that shows how companies can identify, assess and mitigate nature-related risks.\nThe report also deep dives into the risks and the opportunities that exist across seven key industries:\naquaculture\nchemicals\nconstruction materials\nfood, drink and agriculture\nmining and metals\nrenewable energy generation\ntextiles, apparel and fashion\nAXA XL’s global head of sustainability, Suzanne Scatliffe said: “About 50% of the world’s GDP is moderately or highly dependent on nature. To be resilient to the rapid and profound environmental changes occurring now, and in the future, it’s imperative businesses adequately value and manage the nature-related risks across their entire value chain.”\nNature Positive, an RSK Group company, worked with AXA XL to develop a set of insights underpinned by comprehensive reviews of academic papers, industry reports and the guidance from the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD).\nDr. Richard Young, managing director, Nature Positive, said: “Nature is in trouble. In the past 50 years, wildlife populations have, on average, declined by 69%. Most of the planet’s wild grasslands and freshwater wetlands have been lost or heavily degraded, and one-third of our natural forests has been converted for human use. The continuing degradation of nature and biodiversity presents significant risks to business both now and in the future”\nDr. Young said the Nature Risk Insights Report had been developed to enable businesses, and in particular risk managers, to make a start on their nature journey. “Our aim is for you to understand how to begin identifying your nature-related risks and to start making a meaningful difference for nature and for your business.”\nKey takeaways and next steps for risk managers\nIn the report, AXA XL advises that risk managers need to understand the extent to which nature is material to the business.\nIt says: “All businesses are directly or indirectly reliant on the natural world, but the impact and financial materiality of nature and biodiversity to business varies across sectors.”\nA good starting point is to understand the nature impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities for your sector, business or business activity.\nIt advises that one useful tool for conducting such a high-level materiality assessment is ENCORE (Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure).\nThis comprehensive online evidence base provides scientifically robust information on the nature impacts and dependencies of 167 economic sub-industries with materiality ratings and narrative descriptions to understand their significance to your business, as well as accompanying reference papers and the underpinning evidence.\nIt is intuitive to use and provides supporting resources to aid use and interpretation.\nThe AXA XL report outlines five further actions that risk managers, along with wider stakeholders, should take to understand the importance of nature to the business.\n1) Knowledge and awareness\nNature is a vast and complicated topic, including everything from wildlife to ecosystems and the environment. It’s essential for everyone in the company to have a basic understanding of nature and biodiversity and know why these are important for business success.\nThe TNFD has useful resources to help build this knowledge, and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) offers a micro-course on nature and why it matters to businesses. This e-learning catalogue also features a range of options on biodiversity in business, finance and law.\n2) Screening\nTo identify significant nature-related issues, you should conduct a high-level screening exercise, based on readily available company informationm such as product or service strategies, operating locations, distribution networks.\nThe results of the initial materiality assessment (through ENCORE), allows you to broadly define the areas of your company’s ‘value chain’ that you may want to assess more fully.\nThe Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool (IBAT) can also be useful to access global biodiversity datasets, and there are a number of tools freely available online, such as the World Resources Institute Aqueduct Tool and WWF Biodiversity and Water Risk Filter.\n3) Existing data, risks, and controls\nIdentifying and collating relevant existing data and/or risks and controls through colleague collaboration and scanning of current systems and reports can help highlight where data or information gaps might exist.\nThese gaps can then be prioritised and included in a resulting business case outline.\n4) Stakeholders\nFully engaging with priority stakeholders across key parts of your value chain, and asking the right questions, is key to developing areas of potential collaboration, understanding pain points and ultimately ensuring effective assessment of nature risks.\nPlotting the company’s stakeholders on a matrix, with two intersecting variables such as interest and influence, map help identify which part of the value chain or which stakeholder groups should be considered a priority to engage.\nEngagement tools could include questionnaires or surveys, focus groups or even forming a stakeholder committee to develop dialogue on nature-related risks and opportunities, as well as addressing initial data gaps.\nThere should also be detailed discussions with key departments within the organisation where nature may be relevant to help define material risks and opportunities.\n5) Outline business case\nOnce you’ve gathered this information, you will be in a position to develop a business case, if required, to engage with decisionmakers for taking further company action on nature.\nIt should outline the commercial imperative of assessing nature risks and recommendations for next steps, including, if feasible at this stage, outlining the potential costs and resources required. It might also include the identified risks, assumptions, issues, and dependencies (RAID log), alongside the opportunities and benefits relevant to your business.\nNo comments\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nMore Climate Risk\nClimate, technology and geopolitics lead 2025 risks – Beazley CEO\nCase study: Dedalus Group’s CRO explains how the company is tackling CSRD disclosures\nClimate report 2024: Risk managers attitudes to climate threats revealed\nSpotlight on: greenwashing risks and how to avoid them\nSpecial report: Climate change 2024\nClimate reporting causes headaches for risk managers as one in five businesses is unprepared for new regulations\nLoad more articles\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

risk managers\nAIRMIC 2025\nAirmic 2025: A geopolitics survival guide for risk managers\n2025-06-10T17:08:00+01:00\nNo comments\nAt the Airmic conference, an expert panel dissected today’s geopolitical and economic turmoil, urging risk managers to adapt their strategies for an era of chronic disruption.\nRisk managers are facing an era shaped by overlapping global crises.\nEconomic instability, political volatility, geopolitical conflict and shifting trade dynamics are no longer isolated challenges, they interact in complex ways, compounding uncertainty.\nAt today’s Airmic conference, a panel of experts explored how organisations must respond. Their message was clear: traditional assumptions no longer apply, and resilience depends on new thinking, agile planning and a clear-eyed view of geopolitical risk.\nEconomic pressures and stagflation\nThe global economy is walking a tightrope. Inflation remains stubbornly high even as growth slows, creating a climate that complicates financial planning, supply chains and pricing strategies.\n“The global economy faces the biggest stagflationary stress test now… since Covid. But unlike Covid, there is no medicine. And I think the fact is the US faces a much bigger asymmetric Stagflationary shock, meaning higher inflation pressure and lower growth,” said Jerome Haegeli, chief economist at Swiss Re Institute.\nThis pressure is most pronounced in the US, but the implications are global. Unlike the pandemic, there is no coordinated response or quick-fix solution. As a result, forecasting becomes more difficult—and more essential. Risk managers must adjust to prolonged economic turbulence by reinforcing scenario planning, stress testing, and cost-containment strategies.\nPolitical leadership in turmoil\nAlongside economic stress, the political environment has grown increasingly volatile. Governments worldwide are struggling to navigate overlapping crises, from domestic unrest to foreign policy shocks, with leadership quality varying wildly.\n“Do we have the political leadership to cope with all this chaos? I think there’s a very short one word answer with two letters that starts with n and I think in parts of the world, the political leadership is creating problems. And in other parts of the world it’s failing to deal with the problems that have been created,” said Tim Shipman, political columnist.\nFor risk managers, this means building in flexibility. Political shocks, such as regulatory U-turns, election upsets or global realignments, can transform business environments overnight. Companies must monitor developments closely, diversify exposure, and prepare for sudden changes in policy or trade posture.\nGeopolitical conflict and its implications\nThe war in Ukraine, now in its third year, continues to cast a long shadow over international stability. Many early assumptions about the speed or outcome of the conflict have proven dangerously optimistic.\n“It was the height of naive imbecility to suggest that this war could have been done and dusted in 24 hours. There is a lot of talk about the summer offensive. I think it’ll go the way of most Russian offensives. In other words, it won’t get very far,” said Sir Richard Shirreff, former NATO Deputy Strategic Commander.\nThe implications extend far beyond the battlefield. Energy markets remain unstable, cyber aggression is rising, and global supply chains remain vulnerable to escalation or disruption. Risk managers must treat geopolitical risk not as an edge case but as a central operational variable, modelling worst-case scenarios and revisiting crisis management protocols regularly.\nTrade tensions and economic ripple effects\nThe global trading system is under increasing strain. The return of tariffs, coupled with protectionist policies and decoupling efforts, adds another layer of uncertainty for global businesses.\n“The trade war is a lose-lose for the global economy, and Europe has a lot to lose. But we don’t have a recession in our baseline,” observed Barbara Teixeira Auroro from Moody’s Analytics.\nEurope’s economic fundamentals remain intact, but supply chains are feeling the pressure. Strategic industries—particularly technology, automotive and energy—must brace for further fragmentation. Risk managers will need to monitor regulatory developments across borders and build supplier diversity and logistical flexibility into their strategies.\nTakeaways for risk managers\nIn this environment, the role of the risk manager is evolving rapidly. Beyond compliance and reporting, today’s professionals are expected to help organisations anticipate the next disruption—and respond to it with speed and resilience.\nAs Stephanie Ogden, vice president at Moody’s Analytics, put it, “Our job in this room is to manage and keep things flat when the world is like this. And so I think right now it’s never been more difficult to do.”\nTo meet that challenge, risk managers should focus on four key priorities:\nEmbed scenario modelling and stress testing into business planning, particularly for economic, political and supply chain risks\nStrengthen cross-functional collaboration, ensuring risk insights inform board-level decisions\nMonitor emerging threats such as cyber, AI, and regulatory instability\nInvest in agility and culture, equipping teams to respond quickly and flexibly in a crisis\nAs 2025 unfolds, political, economic and geopolitical shocks show no signs of easing. For risk managers, the challenge is not just to react—but to lead. In a landscape defined by complexity, the strongest organisations will be those that expect the unexpected, model the unthinkable, and treat resilience as a strategic asset.\nNo comments\nBLOG: Airmic Conference 2025 Daily News Summary\n1\nBLOG: Airmic Conference 2025 Daily News Summary\n2\nCaptives will relocate to the UK, confirms Airmic CEO\n3\nAirmic 2025: Five lessons for risk managers from Charles Hecker\n4\nAirmic 2025: Geopolitics dominates, but strategic clarity is the real challenge\n5\nAirmic 2025: AI will demand new skills from risk managers and underwriters\n6\nAirmic 2025: Employers urged to stay ahead of rising travel risks\n7\nCurrently reading\nAirmic 2025: A geopolitics survival guide for risk managers\n8\nCaptives gain ground as Airmic hints at Treasury’s next move\n9\nAirmic 2025: AI, cyber risk and trust: how risk managers can keep pace with fast-moving threats\n10\nAirmic 2025: US in fiscal cliff danger as global economic risk rises\n11\nTake the long view as tariffs bite, says financial chief Charles Brindamour\n12\nAirmic 2025: The truth about lithium-ion battery risks and how to manage them\n13\nAirmic 2025: How risk managers are thinking about the threats they face\n14\nGlobal strength, local delivery\n15\nMeet the Airmic shadow board chair: Network Rail’s Taiwo Omo-Ikerodah\n16\nFacing into risk: Interconnected threats demand a smarter, faster response from risk managers\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nMore AIRMIC 2025\nCaptives will relocate to the UK, confirms Airmic CEO\nAirmic 2025: Five lessons for risk managers from Charles Hecker\nAirmic 2025: Geopolitics dominates, but strategic clarity is the real challenge\nAirmic 2025: AI will demand new skills from risk managers and underwriters\nAirmic 2025: Employers urged to stay ahead of rising travel risks\nCaptives gain ground as Airmic hints at Treasury’s next move\nLoad more articles\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

spending, Robert Peston warns the US is heading for fiscal crisis – and Europe must seize the moment.\nFinancial journalist Robert Peston has warned that the United States is on the brink of fiscal disaster, with global consequences that could dwarf previous financial crises.\nSpeaking to risk managers at the Airmic annual conference in Liverpool, Peston predicted that the coming decade could bring significant growth for the UK and Europe - driven largely by instability in the US.\nEurope’s window of opportunity\nPeston argued that global investors were beginning to shift capital away from the US in search of greater stability.\n“The uncertainty in the US is seeing asset managers look to move capital away from the US and a Europe which believes in the rule of law and can deliver greater certainty has the opportunity to be that new home,” he said.\nHe noted, however, that Europe must overcome its own inefficiencies. Capital markets across the continent remain fragmented, and even the London Stock Exchange is losing listings to the US as companies scale up.\n“We need more capital but at present out capital markets are inefficient. The London Stock Exchange for example is seeing companies who are looking to take the next step in their growth plans looking to US markets. In Europe capital market remain fragmented,” he said.\nYet political leaders are waking up to the opportunity. “There are real reasons to believe that the next three or four years will allow the UK and Europe to be more optimistic,” Peston added.\nDeliberate disorder in Washington\nIn contrast, Peston painted a bleak picture of the US under Donald Trump’s renewed leadership. The former president’s fiscal strategy, he argued, risks pushing the country into full-blown economic crisis.\n“Although I have reported in crisis after crisis since the economic crash of 2007-2008, which includes Brexit and the Covid pandemic, I do not believe I have ever been in a more uncertain world than that I see today. We are living though history,” he said.\n“The chaos he causes is deliberate,” he continued, citing former advisor Steve Bannon’s infamous phrase: ‘flood the zones with s**t.’\n“We have seen this hour after hour with a huge range of announcements and we have seen national guards on the streets of Los Angeles and the concern over the immigration approach, coupled with his announcement over tariffs,” said Peston.\n“He has launched his one beautiful bill and his approach to international rule of law is simply not to care about it.”\nA trillion-dollar deficit and a warning for risk managers\nThe journalist also raised concerns about the scale of Trump’s spending, warning that the fiscal bill would deepen the national deficit by $2.4 trillion over the next decade.\n“Because of, tariffs there is global economic uncertainty and normally that would see a move towards the dollar, However, asset managers are moving away from the dollar. US interest rates are rising, and the dollar has been falling,” he said.\nThe implications could be global. “It has raised the real spectre of the world turning its back on the United States and saying they will not fund this fiscal recklessness.\n“If we get to the state of a Liz Truss style crisis in the US it will be a global crisis that will be at a level which would make the economic crash of 20207/8 look like a tea party.”\nAlthough some tariff measures have been partially rolled back, Peston warned that rates remain alarmingly high. “We have tariffs at level which we have not seen since the Great Depression in the 1920s and 1930s,” he said.\nNo comments\nBLOG: Airmic Conference 2025 Daily News Summary\n1\nBLOG: Airmic Conference 2025 Daily News Summary\n2\nCaptives will relocate to the UK, confirms Airmic CEO\n3\nAirmic 2025: Five lessons for risk managers from Charles Hecker\n4\nAirmic 2025: Geopolitics dominates, but strategic clarity is the real challenge\n5\nAirmic 2025: AI will demand new skills from risk managers and underwriters\n6\nAirmic 2025: Employers urged to stay ahead of rising travel risks\n7\nAirmic 2025: A geopolitics survival guide for risk managers\n8\nCaptives gain ground as Airmic hints at Treasury’s next move\n9\nAirmic 2025: AI, cyber risk and trust: how risk managers can keep pace with fast-moving threats\n10\nCurrently reading\nAirmic 2025: US in fiscal cliff danger as global economic risk rises\n11\nTake the long view as tariffs bite, says financial chief Charles Brindamour\n12\nAirmic 2025: The truth about lithium-ion battery risks and how to manage them\n13\nAirmic 2025: How risk managers are thinking about the threats they face\n14\nGlobal strength, local delivery\n15\nMeet the Airmic shadow board chair: Network Rail’s Taiwo Omo-Ikerodah\n16\nFacing into risk: Interconnected threats demand a smarter, faster response from risk managers\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nMore AIRMIC 2025\nCaptives will relocate to the UK, confirms Airmic CEO\nAirmic 2025: Five lessons for risk managers from Charles Hecker\nAirmic 2025: Geopolitics dominates, but strategic clarity is the real challenge\nAirmic 2025: AI will demand new skills from risk managers and underwriters\nAirmic 2025: Employers urged to stay ahead of rising travel risks\nAirmic 2025: A geopolitics survival guide for risk managers\nLoad more articles\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

and what to do about it\n2025-05-23T18:13:00+01:00\nNo comments\nNarcissistic CEOs don’t just lead - they steer entire organisations into bold, and sometimes perilous, territory.\nA recent study published in the Strategic Management Journal sheds light on a compelling dynamic in corporate leadership: how narcissistic CEOs wield their influence over boardroom discussions to steer companies toward riskier paths.\nBy carefully directing conversations and amplifying a pro-risk tone, these CEOs shape the strategic trajectory in ways that reflect their own ambition and desire for grand achievement.\nThis influence is particularly pronounced when narcissistic CEOs also hold the chair’s role on the board. Through an in-depth analysis of board meeting transcripts from 88 public companies over two decades, researchers uncovered a pattern — narcissistic CEOs not only dominate discussions but frame risky moves as visionary while sidelining cautionary perspectives.\nThe findings bring to light a crucial yet often underexplored aspect of corporate governance: the significant impact of CEO personality traits on firm risk management.\nAs these leaders cultivate a culture that favours ambitious, high-stakes strategies, they can drive impressive gains, but with heightened volatility. This insight underscores a growing need for companies to assess executive traits when shaping risk strategies.\nFor boards and risk managers, recognising and navigating the nuances of a narcissistic CEO’s approach becomes essential in balancing the company’s long-term stability with bold, potentially disruptive strategies.\nFor risk managers, overseeing the C-suite is a core responsibility that requires balancing the complex tasks of reporting and explaining risk in a manner that aligns with leadership’s strategy.\nHowever, with a narcissistic CEO in place - a personality defined by self-centeredness, a strong need for admiration, and a tendency to disregard others’ input - these responsibilities can become notably more challenging. As narcissistic leaders tend to pursue bolder, higher-stakes moves and resist alternative views, risk managers may face intensified challenges in creating a balanced approach to organisational risk.\n“Chasing aggressive growth or stretching resources thin in pursuit of personal validation can place undue strain on an organisation.”\n“Research has consistently shown that narcissistic CEOs can drive short-term success by taking bigger risks, which sometimes lead to impressive results,” says Memory Nguwi, managing consultant for Industrial Psychology Consultants.\n“But in the long term, this narcissistic approach can damage overall performance. Studies on narcissistic CEOs reveal complex outcomes - success is often mixed, with significant highs and lows.”\nThis dichotomy reflects the broader dilemma these leaders pose: while their bold strategies can sometimes yield gains, they also tend to create a pattern of volatility that can jeopardise stable, long-term performance.\nParth Makhija, a business author of Narcissism: The Hidden Path to the CEO’s Chair, explains that narcissistic CEOs are formidable forces in the boardroom, especially when they hold the chair’s position. “Their need to dominate discussions and foster a positive tone around high-risk strategies can steer an organisation into precarious territory,” he says.\n“It’s common to see them reframing bold risks as visionary, while minimising the potential pitfalls. This manipulation not only affects the board’s decision-making but can also filter down to impact broader company culture.”\nThis influence is not simply abstract - it has tangible repercussions. “I’ve observed firsthand how this leadership style can put organisations at risk,” says Makhija.\n“Chasing aggressive growth or stretching resources thin in pursuit of personal validation can place undue strain on an organisation. Facing such a leader requires a steady and principled approach to keep the organisation on track without undermining morale.”\nHow does a narcissistic CEO act?\nUnderstanding the behaviours of narcissistic CEOs is essential for navigating corporate leadership dynamics. These leaders often exhibit distinct traits, such as a grandiose self-image and a relentless pursuit of admiration, which significantly influence their decision-making and the overall corporate culture.\nNguwi notes that narcissistic CEOs often lean towards bold, high-stakes strategies that can result in extreme performance outcomes, often leading to notable successes or substantial failures. Their companies experience marked swings in performance, reflecting their preference for ambitious strategies.\n“Narcissistic CEOs often draw on aggressive strategies they see from other prominent firms”\nThese tendencies create high visibility but are not necessarily indicators of long-term success. He cited a meta-analysis of narcissistic CEOs showing that their leadership style drives organisations to adopt high-risk, high-reward strategies but does not always translate into sustained positive outcomes. This pattern results in what’s sometimes referred to as “boom and bust” cycles, where companies soar one quarter and slump the next.\n“Narcissistic CEOs often draw on aggressive strategies they see from other prominent firms, seeing themselves as visionaries on a similar scale,” Nguwi says.\n“However, they tend to resist others’ input, which stifles diversity in strategic thinking and can limit the board’s ability to counterbalance extreme proposals.” This resistance to diverse perspectives creates an echo chamber where only favourable viewpoints are considered, further narrowing the organisation’s strategic adaptability.\nDo narcissistic CEOs always want more risk?\n“It’s inaccurate to assume narcissistic CEOs always push for more risk,” says Alex Sidorenko, chief risk officer and founder of RISK-ACADEMY. “They may indeed pursue risks for bold gains, but they can be equally risk-averse if they believe a decision could harm their personal brand.”\nThis tendency towards image control underscores a nuanced trait of narcissistic leadership: while these CEOs may take big risks to boost their profiles, they may also avoid risks that could backfire and tarnish their reputation.\n“A narcissistic CEO might resist essential risks to protect their image, opting for short-term wins that enhance their public perception,” Sidorenko adds. “Conversely, they could swing towards recklessness if they believe it would bolster their profile as a bold leader, creating a pendulum between conservatism and risky behaviour.”\nThis variable tolerance for risk suggests that narcissistic CEOs’ choices are driven as much by personal gain as by organisational objectives, making it essential for boards and risk managers to stay vigilant to the CEO’s current priorities.\nHow can risk managers handle narcissistic CEOs?\nSidorenko highlights the importance of objectively evaluating a narcissistic CEO’s risk profile rather than assuming they are consistently pro-risk. “Some practical steps include measuring how risk-taking aligns with the organisation’s goals,” he says.\nMetrics like risk-adjusted returns on capital, as well as cash flow and risk exposure metrics, can be instrumental for risk managers to gauge whether the CEO’s strategies are balanced or skewed too heavily towards ambition or conservatism.\nSidorenko also suggests analysing how a CEO’s choices impact core business metrics, such as growth, market share, and innovation. “If a narcissistic CEO is avoiding necessary risks, like stalling an expansion, you can show how this decision negatively impacts metrics over time,” he says.\n“Framing issues in terms of quantifiable goals rather than personal viewpoints can steer the board towards strategic facts and away from personality-driven decisions.”\nEstablishing predefined risk thresholds can also help ensure a more balanced risk approach. “For instance, if the company is not taking enough risk to meet growth targets, this should be flagged to the board as a concern,” Sidorenko says.\n“If you present data that supports your recommendations, they may be more receptive as it aligns with their need to succeed.”\n“Risk managers can redirect conversations to focus on organisational goals, helping to curb the CEO’s influence if it becomes overly cautious or excessively ambitious.”\nEamonn Cunningham, former CRO of Westfield/ Scentre Group says you need checks and balances in an environment where you have to moderate the behavior of a narcissistic CEO for the good of the enterprise.\n“In a boardroom setting this starts with the processes in place whereby the board is selected,” says Cunningham. “Do you call up a couple of ‘friendlies’ and sound them out to fill a board vacancy, or are there formal or informal board processes in place to fill vacancies, such as using a search firm? Is there a nominations committee that handles such matters?”\nNguwi also recommended tailoring communication to suit the narcissistic CEO’s need for validation. “Frame suggestions as enhancements to their vision,” he advises.\n“For instance, if you present data that supports your recommendations, they may be more receptive as it aligns with their need to succeed.” Presenting data-backed arguments also strengthens a risk manager’s position, as narcissistic CEOs often respond more to evidence-based information than to opinions or dissenting perspectives.\n“If you cannot directly counter their influence, building alliances within the boardroom can provide a buffer”\nFor Makhija, a collaborative approach can be invaluable in balancing the influence of a narcissistic CEO. “If you cannot directly counter their influence, building alliances within the boardroom can provide a buffer,” he says. “A coalition of like-minded voices can act as a check against any impulsive or ego-driven choices.”\nTransparency and accountability in decision-making are also key. “Encouraging regular assessments and grounding each decision in data, facts, and logical arguments can mitigate some of the risks posed by ego-driven leadership,” Makhija says. “This transparency ensures that strategic decisions reflect the organisation’s best interests rather than the CEO’s personal ambition.”\nOverall, narcissistic CEOs, while sometimes bold and visionary, can also drive volatility and imbalance in strategy. Their need for control and admiration may prompt them to favour risky decisions to showcase their leadership, but it can also create scenarios where organisational stability is compromised.\nFor risk managers, handling such leaders requires a careful approach - balancing validation with accountability and constantly steering the organisation back to its core goals.\nIn the high-stakes environment of corporate leadership, narcissistic CEOs represent a unique challenge, embodying both visionary potential and inherent risks. For boards and risk managers, recognising and managing these traits can be the key to ensuring that the CEO’s vision is harnessed responsibly, guiding the company towards sustainable growth without veering into unstable territory.\nNo comments\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nMore Governance Risk\nSpotlight on: rising ESG violations within supply chains and how to tackle them\nRisk briefing: supply chain lessons from the Tuff Torq child labor scandal\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

must learn from Tesla’s ESG crisis\n2025-04-18T15:44:00+01:00\nNo comments\nSwedish insurance and pension group Folksam’s decision to divest its $160million holdings in Tesla is a warning shot to the wider business community, take ESG seriously, or face the consequences\nEarlier this month, Swedish insurance and pension group Folksam announced that it had divested its entire holdings in Tesla, worth approximately $160 million USD.\nThis decision was directly linked to Tesla’s ongoing refusal to sign a collective bargaining agreement with Swedish trade unions, notably IF Metall, which represents mechanics and other workers in Sweden’s automotive sector.\nThe divestment follows nearly 18 months of escalating industrial conflict in Sweden, sparked by Tesla’s non-recognition of union demands and its refusal to enter into a collective agreement — a cornerstone of Swedish labour relations.\nFolksam said it had tried to influence the carmaker through proposals submitted to the company’s annual general meeting for two years in a row.\n“But this isn’t just about one Scandinavian fund offloading a fraction of a percent - it’s a warning shot.”\nHead of asset management and sustainability Marcus Blomberg added: “Unfortunately, no improvement has been seen, and a decision has therefore been made to divest the holding.”\nSaid Sadykhov, director of strategy and business development at Metal Expert and an executive adviser to several boards commented on LinkedIn: “Folksam, which manages over $80 billion in assets, sold its $160 million stake in Tesla after twice attempting to push the company toward collective bargaining agreements for Swedish mechanics. With no progress from Tesla, led by Elon Musk, Folksam walked away.\n“But this isn’t just about one Scandinavian fund offloading a fraction of a percent - it’s a warning shot. In ESG-focused markets like the Nordics, labour standards are non-negotiable, and investors are willing to take a stand.\n“If others follow Folksam’s lead, Tesla could face mounting pressure in Europe - not just from unions, but from capital seeking companies that align with their values.”\nBackground\nDisputes began in late 2023, when IF Metall mechanics went on strike after repeated unsuccessful attempts to negotiate with Tesla. This sparked a wave of solidarity actions across Sweden:\nDockworkers refused to unload Tesla vehicles\nElectricians and repair workers joined work stoppages\nPostal workers blocked the delivery of licence plates for new Tesla cars\nDespite this widespread pressure, CEO Elon Musk has refused to engage.\nThe company argues that it offers competitive pay and working conditions — which it believes makes collective bargaining unnecessary.\nTesla has also sought legal recourse in Sweden, including efforts to overturn the postal blockade preventing delivery of licence plates, calling it unlawful and disruptive to business operations. A Swedish court in January 2025 denied Tesla’s request, ruling in favour of the unions’ right to take solidarity action.\nKey lessons for businesses and risk managers\nFolksam’s decision highlights how social issues - including labour rights - are not peripheral concerns for boards.\nInstead, they are core to ESG investment frameworks - and investors can and will pull the plug on organisations that they cannot work with. Organisations that fail to engage, or to demonstrate progress in meeting ESG targets, will suffer.\nFirms perceived as unresponsive or dismissive of investor concerns may find themselves isolated, especially in socially conscious markets like Scandinavia.\nFolksam had previously attempted to influence Tesla’s behaviour via shareholder proposals - without success. This reflects a broader lesson: shareholder engagement only works if management is willing to listen.\nTesla’s operations in Sweden — a relatively small market — have become the focus of international attention, highlighting how labour disputes can escalate into broader reputational crises. Tesla’s refusal to adapt has resulted in sustained reputational harm and operational disruptions.\n“This isn’t just a finance story; it’s a reputational and strategic one.”\nJennifer Kaplan, an Adjunct Professor who teaches Marketing and Communications for Social Impact at Presidio Graduate School, said: “Tesla had successfully branded itself as a climate leader, but is now failing to connect that sustainability narrative to its broader corporate behaviour, including how it treats workers and manages the company.\n“That disconnect eroded trust and created reputational risk, which in turn became financial risk. This isn’t just a finance story; it’s a reputational and strategic one. For businesses, and especially for Chief Risk Officers, the message is clear: ESG is a core risk management function.”\nIn fact, Folksam’s decision highlights a growing shift in how global stakeholders are defining and acting on ESG priorities.\nKaplan explains: “For a while now, criticisms of Tesla’s governance—on a range of issues from widespread race discrimination and harassment to excessive Board compensation—has eroded its social license to operate, particularly in markets where stakeholder capitalism is the norm.\n“Now, further undermining confidence is Elon Musk’s recent activities in the name of the Department of Government Efficiency, his attempt to inject himself into political discourse. This move is more than just unpopular. It signals a troubling diversion of focus.\n“CEOs are wise to steer clear of political issues. Wading into political waters is fraught with danger and the upside is very limited.”\n“For a CEO already stretched across multiple ventures, engaging in politics at this scale dilutes executive leadership at a time when Tesla faces real ESG scrutiny. For investors and employees alike, this raises governance concerns and reinforces the perception that Musk’s attention is increasingly misaligned with Tesla’s core business and stakeholder obligations.”\nKaplan isn’t the only expert who believes that Musk’s wider political ambitions are compounding the problems faced by Tesla amid the firm’s current ESG crisis.\nRobert R. Johnson, PhD, CFA, CAIA, Professor of Finance, Heider College of Business, Creighton University said: “CEOs are wise to steer clear of political issues. Wading into political waters is fraught with danger and the upside is very limited. Elon Musk aligning himself so closely with Trump and working for the administration has alienated a big portion of the organic Tesla consumer base and potential Tesla consumer base.\n“Whether on the right or on the left, taking positions that could alienate a large part of your consumer base is an unwise strategy for any CEO. And, now Musk is publicly feuding with Peter Navarro. So, he has alienated a significant portion of the left and is in the process of alienating staunch Trump supporters on the right. Simply put, that is not good for business and is a template for destruction of shareholder value.”\n“Global institutions and next-gen consumers are pushing companies toward higher standards”\nUltimately, businesses and risk managers looking to learn from what is happening to Tesla should start by examining their own ESG credentials, and ensuring that their governance models are aligned with key investors.\nAs Kaplan concludes: “Even future-forward companies aren’t immune to ESG backlash if they neglect the ‘G’ in ESG. ESG isn’t a checkbox. It’s an integrated risk lens. Stakeholders, from institutional investors to customers, are increasingly vocal, values-driven, and willing to act. Ignoring the social and governance dimensions of ESG can cost even the most innovative companies more than market share. It can cost them their seat at the table.\n“And perhaps most importantly: the ESG transition transcends political headwinds because it’s being driven by long-term financial materiality and multi-stakeholder accountability.\n“While some markets will continue to politicise ESG, global institutions and next-gen consumers are pushing companies toward higher standards. Not because it’s trendy, but because it’s increasingly essential for resilience, brand integrity, and license to operate.”\nNo comments\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

But while they can’t fix a poor culture, working with HR to enhance employee benefits can signifi cantly boost wellbeing, and lower your people risk.\nIf there’s a cadre of professionals organisations must have absolute confidence in, it’s their lawyers.\nPoor decisions expose firms to untold risk. And yet, according to Carla Hoppe, founder of financial literacy consultancy, Wealthbrite, it’s exactly the lack of one key benefit – mental health training and financial wellness learning – that she believes is driving lawyer confidence to crisis point.\n“Wellness among legal professions is at an alltime low,” says Hoppe, who works directly with The Solicitors Charity, which aims to boost wellbeing by imparting financial knowledge.\n“Lawyers are the people that everyone expects to be experts,” she says. “But with this comes crippling pressure. Combine this with a company culture that says they can’t be wrong, not only does it create intense and heightened worry, but even riskier behaviours can potentially ensue, such as them trying to cover an error up – which only makes matters worse.”\nALL RISK IS PEOPLE RISK\nFor Hoppe, this reality is a perfect example of how people can be less a company’s ‘greatest asset’, and more its greatest risk.\nBut it’s also why she feels HR must take on a greater role working with risk managers to come up with solutions that mitigate this risk – through the benefits they can provide.\n“Risk arises from stresses in the system. It’s when you start looking at the role that benefits can play to improve wellness, avoid certain conduct, raise happiness and create better resilience among staff, that you see how HR and risk management should be better aligned to reduce risk.”\nWhile it’s true to say benefits have always been used to a drive and reward key behaviours, there is an increasing recognition that benefits can play  a strategic role in reducing risk.\nMercer specifically calls this EBRM, or employee benefit risk management. In its own 2023 poll of top risks for UK businesses, many were specifically people-linked – from employers’ ability to attract and retain top talent to attitudes to wellbeing.It highlighted risks not just from direct employees, but also from staff in an organisation’s supply chains.\nA whopping 80% of the top risks in Aon’s recent Global Risk Management Survey were people related. These included threats to business continuity and even cybersecurity risks due to employee disengagement, demotivation and attrition of key talent.\nTOP TIPS FROM AN HR CONSULTANT\nNatalie Ellie, HR consultant and director at Rebox HR, explains that employee benefits can be a powerful risk management tool, addressing many people-related business risks. She offers a number of recommendations.\nIntroduce ‘values-aligned’ benefits. These reflect company values (sustainability allowances, volunteering time) and can strengthen culture and reduce value misalignment risk.\nThink about operational risk: Salary sacrifice schemes, financial education, and emergency savings programmes can reduce financial stress that impacts concentration and performance.\nPrioritise mental health benefits: Employee assistance programmes, therapy, and mental wellbeing apps can mitigate stress-related productivity losses.\nDATA DEMANDS\nProving causality – that a specific benefit yields a specific result – has always been a problem, but this is where it’s hoped things are changing. “\nJust in the last six months, we’ve created a people risk committee comprising benefits specialists,” says David Collington, partner and head of benefit consulting at Barnett Waddingham.\n“They’re tasked with linking risk and benefits into quantifiable evidence.” He adds: “It seems lots of people instinctively know about risk; but the data piece is often what’s missing.”\nIt’s already known that some benefits levers can be pulled to yield specific responses. David Joerring, CEO and founder at HealthKey, gives one example. “We find that when you offer an online GP service to staff\nand dependants, there is an increase in retention of between 31–33%,” he says. He explains that a health-focused risk-aware retention strategy can make a significant difference, considering replacing employees costs 50–200% of that person’s annual salary.\n“I think the financials around risk are finally putting benefits up the strategic chain. For many firms, not being able to recruit is now a strategic risk on its own. As companies downsize, or even try to reduce perceived risk using AI, the actual result is that risk increases, because companies become more exposed to the risk carried by the smaller numbers of people left behind.”\n“Benefits chiefs and risk chiefs have a tendency to swim in their own lanes. The people function and risk function need to be more joined up”\nWhat detractors will often raise, however, is that benefits seldom work in isolation. As Joerring says: “Benefits can’t fix a bad culture.”\nCollington adds: “We recently worked with a client that had two di¡erent locations, each with identical benefits. In one, the people-related risk metrics were twice as bad. That was clearly down to how managers ran each site very differently.”\nAlso, while risk officers will often seek to reduce health-related risks, for example by introducing wellbeing benefits, to reduce insurance premiums, Collington notes that often, while real risks do fall, insurance costs rise. Staff are actually accessing their health perks.\nAs such, he says HR and risk experts need to work together. Jeff Fox, strategic consulting lead in the employee and people solutions practice at Lockton, adds: “Benefits chiefs and risk chiefs have a tendency to swim in their own lanes. The people function and risk function need to be more joined up, to produce more of a comprehensive risk register. A partnership approach is needed, but also a change in mindset about what ‘risk’ means.”\nJoerring believes that all of a company’s risk is essentially people risk, and that’s the big shift in thinking that is needed.\nCASE STUDY: PROTECTION AGAINST PHISHING VULNERABILITY\nOne major provider of global precision surgical instruments and consumables recently identified that the risk of it succumbing to intellectual property theft, compliance violations, cybersecurity threats and ransomware attacks was rising.\nIn partnership with Meta1st, an AI-driven human risk management provider, real-time, scenario-based cybersecurity training was provided to surgeons and administrative staff who were identified as being prime targets for phishing, social engineering and credential theft.\nSupport also came in the form of real-time simulated phishing attack training (comprising scenarios mimicking cyber threats targeting medical technology firms); personalised training modules; as well as tailored risk training for surgeons, engineers, and sales representatives handling sensitive data.\nBehavioural risk scoring was carried out to identify high-risk employees and departments were targeted for risk mitigation. The result was an 80% reduction in successful phishing attempts within six months as well as Improved regulatory compliance and reduced legal and financial exposure.”\nQasim Bhatti, CEO Meta1st, says: “Strategic risk management is paramount in the high-stakes environment of healthcare. The medical sector is particularly vulnerable to human-centric risks, including social engineering attacks, compliance failures and insider threats. Strategic risk in healthcare is inextricably linked to human risk and an effective human risk management strategy.”\nA LEAP OF FAITH\nBut when benefits thinking does get joined up with risk, big things can happen. Collington worked with an airport group whose employee health scores were poor, and so it advised off\nering an all-company employer-funded healthcare policy. He says: “There was a significant 15% reduction in sickness absence, and turnover of staff. Without data proving the intervention, it wouldn’t have been a conversation the risk team could have had.”\nAnd it goes further than that. Claire Williams, chief people and operations officer at HR software provider Ciphr, says: “Beyond retention, benefits help safeguard against workforce-related risks such as burnout, human error, poor decision-making, and ethical lapses, creating a more stable and productive workforce, and reducing costly errors and compliance failures.”\n“With benefits, risk experts do sometimes have to have faith”\nSo will benefits and risk head soon be talking each other’s language? The hope is that they will, believes Mike Laird, head of risk at Personal Group: “The science of risk is constantly evolving, and we as professionals need to evolve to meet that risk.”\n“Something like disengagement can be accidental or on purpose – and when it’s the latter, it’s most dangerous. But managing risk involves creating a good employee value proposition that gives people a sense they’re being nurtured. I truly believe that reward and benefits drive preferred behaviours. I’m now personally involved in a lot more of what HR does.”\nMany will be glad of this, including Hoppe: “Risk managers have their fingers on the pulse – of what risk is, and how they mitigate it. When people aren’t operating at their best, everything may start to fall apart.”\nCollington concludes that it’s a question of trust: “With benefits, risk experts do sometimes have to have faith. The results can take a while to come through – but if properly applied based on rigorous assessment of need and results – it’s likely they will come!”\nNo comments\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nMore Employee Benefits\nThe people person: How Qisda’s chief HR, sustainability and risk officer is tackling the talent crunch\nCase study: Transitioning to include HR responsibilities as a risk manager\nCase study: how Ayala is attracting talent and reducing people risk\nRIMS names LaBranche new CEO\nDAY 1: Protecting employees\nWhy risk managers must ensure staff mental wellbeing is high on the corporate agenda\nLoad more articles\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

risks\nDanny Lin is an experienced risk manager who has been with Taiwan-based tech firm Qisda for nearly 20 years. However, in more recent years, he has also assumed HR duties at the organisation.\nToday, he is vice president, chief human resource, sustainability and risk officer, in charge of the group’s human resource planning, risk management, and sustainability governance and development.\nSuch a multifaceted role, including HR and risk, has the potential to become increasingly common for risk managers, with people risk now becoming one of the key challenges facing corporations in various fields.\nEven if risk managers do not assume a formal HR role, increasingly working with HR to solve the talent crisis seems likely for many risk managers.\nThe value of role switching\nAt Qisda, HR and risk management remain two independent functional units and have not been formally merged. However, Lin said what connects the two is a deep understanding of talent risk.\n“Since 2017, Qisda has implemented a manager rotation system. The core aim of this system is to promote employees’ diverse development, allowing them to accumulate experience in different roles and thereby enhance their understanding of the overall operation of the enterprise,” said Lin.\n“Talent risk is one of the company’s top three risks. I’ve always hoped to lead HR in a new direction through my expertise in risk management.”\nLin said that moving into HR has enabled him to adapt to a new system, with the role switch giving him the opportunity to “turn over a new leaf” within the same organisation.\nApplying risk management to HR\n“I applied risk management thinking to HR in various ways. Firstly, I categorised work tasks by importance and classification. In terms of project management, I evaluate projects, dividing them into urgency and importance, then list key items, create a schedule, make action plans, and control them,” said Lin.\n“In terms of excellence and innovation, I do not assume that the current process is the best. I always aim to break through with innovation, process reengineering, and optimisation. Embrace the spirit of ‘there is no best, only better,’ and ensure all innovations and process improvements comply with regulations.”\n“In order to remain competitive in a rapidly changing environment, we must continually break down barriers between departments”\nLin said he also focused on maximising resource sharing, leveraging large-scale resources to support smaller ones, and giving full attention to the benefits of resource sharing.\n“This kind of job rotation not only helps with talent development, but also makes the organisation more resilient in risk management, allowing it to identify potential talent risks more keenly and take preventive measures more quickly.\n“In order to remain competitive in a rapidly changing environment, we must continually break down barriers between departments and cultivate management talent with a cross-disciplinary vision. This cross-functional integration is not a formal consolidation, but a shift in mindset, allowing risk management and human resources management to blend into the operations of the organisation naturally.”\nFixing talent-related risks\nLin said that after transitioning to human resources, he was able to integrate the risk management system framework with frontline operations in HR, which not only fosters deep integration between the two fields but also results in performance improvements.\n“In the past, risk management focused on establishing regulations and preventive mechanisms. After delving into HR functions, it became clear that core HR functions such as organisational design, talent development, and performance management can actually enhance the effectiveness of risk management,” said Lin.\n“For example, by designing organisational structures through International Position Evaluation (IPE), the company can respond more flexibly to market changes, reduce risks caused by structural rigidity, and align suitable talent with the right positions based on job benchmarks, thus reducing the risks of talent mobility.”\n“The practical operations on HR’s frontlines provide a wealth of personnel-related data and insights, which are critical to risk management.”\nLin said that in talent development, establishing clear succession plans and rotation systems can reduce the risk of disruptions in key positions due to personnel changes.\n“In performance management, HR can design risk-aware evaluation metrics to incorporate risk management into daily operations, thereby enhancing the overall risk prevention and control capabilities of the organisation,” he said.\n“The practical operations on HR’s frontlines provide a wealth of personnel-related data and insights, which are critical to risk management. For instance, by analysing employee satisfaction, turnover rates, and training effectiveness, potential talent risks can be identified early, allowing for quick adjustments.”\nMajor challenges in talent risk\nLin said the group is transitioning from a traditional ICT model to a large fleet-style diversified business structure, which not only requires attracting and retaining more high-quality talent but also ensuring the diversity and adaptability of the talent structure to support the development needs of each business unit.\n“The shortage of both the quantity and quality of talent is one of the main challenges we are facing. As the group expands its business scope, especially in areas such as technological innovation and digital transformation, we require more specialised skilled talent. However, the supply of talent in these specialised fields has remained tight, particularly in cutting-edge technologies such as digitalisation, data analytics, and artificial intelligence,” said Lin.\n“The shortage of both the quantity and quality of talent is one of the main challenges we are facing.”\n“To address this issue, in addition to strengthening recruitment, we are also actively investing in the development of internal talent and promoting skill upgrades for our employees. This is not only a necessary measure to increase talent supply but also a key to improving talent quality. We are also making efforts to strengthen our presence on campuses and signing MOU agreements with universities to enhance industry-academia collaboration.”\nLin said the organisation conducted a comprehensive review and positioning of the HR system, key functions, and tasks.\n“Within the organisation, HR was repositioned as a strategic unit. We aimed to transform HR 2.0, the traditional human resource management model, into HR 3.0, which focuses on talent capital value. HR transitioned from a support unit to a strategic partner, viewing talent as an asset rather than a cost,” he added.\nNo comments\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nMore Employee Benefits\nThe people person: How Qisda’s chief HR, sustainability and risk officer is tackling the talent crunch\nRisk tool spotlight: using benefits to better manage people risk\nCase study: how Ayala is attracting talent and reducing people risk\nRIMS names LaBranche new CEO\nDAY 1: Protecting employees\nWhy risk managers must ensure staff mental wellbeing is high on the corporate agenda\nLoad more articles\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

complexity and board concerns rise\n2025-05-15T14:37:00+01:00\nNo comments\nNew research from WTW reveals how global firms are moving from disruption response to long-term resilience planning, yet many still lack visibility, control and fit-for-purpose cover.\nThe nature of supply chain risk is changing, with geopolitical instability, digital vulnerabilities and executive oversight emerging as key concerns for global companies.\nAccording to WTW’s 2025 Global Supply Chain Risk Survey, organisations are moving away from short-term disruption management and facing up to deeper systemic issues.\nBased on responses from 1,000 senior leaders at companies with over $250 million in annual revenue, the study reveals how cyber risk, reputational threats and board-level engagement are reshaping priorities.\nHowever, insurance solutions are struggling to adapt, and only a small minority of firms say they have full control over their risk landscape.\nCyber climbs the agenda\nCybersecurity has become a primary focus. In 2023, just 5% of respondents ranked cyber as their top concern. This year, that figure has jumped to 16%. One in four rated cyber risk as high, and a further 21% said it was very high. Fewer than 2% considered the threat to be low.\nWTW links this shift to both the increasing volume and severity of attacks. “The dramatic rise in concern underscores the increasing frequency and severity of cyber attacks, making businesses more aware of the importance of securing their digital operations,” the report warns.\nThe findings align with WTW’s wider research into interconnected threats, which classifies cyber as a systemic business risk. With supply chains now spanning multiple tiers and geographies, the potential for digital disruption through third parties is growing rapidly.\nSimon Sølvsten, head of organisational resilience research at the WTW Research Network, said: “Supply chains are the backbone of any organisational ecosystem.\n“Their complex design, international reach, and broad exposure to risk present significant challenges for organisations in maintaining the necessary understanding and oversight of inherent risks crucial for building efficient organizational resilience, especially as they strive to keep pace with the evolving risk landscape.”\nCoverage concerns and pricing pressures\nDespite greater awareness, many businesses remain frustrated by the limitations of risk transfer. Non-damage business interruption (BI) and contingent BI insurance have faced criticism for limited availability, unpredictable claims triggers and pricing misalignment.\nHugo Wegbrans, head of corporate risk and broking for Europe at WTW, explained: “The complexity of modern supply chains presents a unique challenge for the insurance industry, where risks must be thoroughly understood and accurately quantified to enable effective diversification and appropriate premium pricing.\n“Proper risk quantification is essential to ensure that premiums reflect actual exposures, enhancing acceptable risk profiling, competitiveness, and the overall appeal of the market.”\nHowever, only 8% of companies surveyed said they had complete control over their supply chain risks. At the same time, 63% reported higher-than-expected losses, with 10% saying the financial impact was “much higher than expected”.\nBoard-level focus intensifies\nIn 2023, just over a third of firms listed lack of board buy-in as one of their top three risk management challenges. In the latest survey, that number rose sharply to 75%, reflecting growing concern at the highest levels of business.\nThis shift comes alongside a change in how supply chain threats are perceived. Where short-term operational disruption once dominated, executives are now more focused on long-term strategic impact.\nReputational risk is now the most feared consequence of a supply chain failure, cited by 66.5% of respondents. That is a significant rise from 41% two years earlier. Loss of customer trust (65%) and long-term erosion of market share (49%) are also now seen as greater threats than temporary sales losses.\nAs a result, more companies are investing in structural improvements. Fifty percent of firms now describe their supply chain approach as strategic, using dual sourcing, inventory buffers and supplier segmentation. Just 5% still rely on reactive crisis management.\nInvestment in data and digital tools\nFirms are also turning to technology to improve risk oversight. Nearly half (46%) said that improved data was the biggest opportunity for supply chain risk management, while 41% now rank digital transformation among their top priorities, up from 31% in 2023.\nThese investments are beginning to shift the conversation away from disruption response and towards long-term resilience. However, the benefits are not yet fully realised. Only 22% of firms said their resilience had “greatly improved” over the past two years, down from 28% in WTW’s previous survey.\n“Navigating these challenges is no small feat,” said Sølvsten. “Organizations must be proactively anticipating, mitigating and managing a growing range of potential disruptions.”\nThe road ahead\nThe report concludes that global supply chains are now more interdependent and exposed than ever, but the tools used to manage them have not kept pace. Gaps in visibility, data quality and insurance fit remain persistent barriers.\nRisk managers, in particular, are being called on to lead conversations around proactive modelling, contractual safeguards and fit-for-purpose risk transfer. The challenge is no longer just to react but to anticipate and act — aligning operational resilience with executive priorities and long-term strategic value.\nNo comments\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

But over-reliance on this new tech could expose the entire chain to new weaknesses in accuracy, security and fairness.\nAI is currently being viewed as a catchall solution to everything from cancer diagnostics to fraud detection, from predicting stock market trends to personalised education.\nRisk professionals are not immune to such optimism. While AI has already shown its worth in predictive analytics and operational risk management, there is one potential area of use in particular that is sparking interest among risk managers — the supply chain.\nIn January, an IDC report predicted that by 2026, 60% of APAC companies will use generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools to support core supply chain processes. “The integration of AI within supply chains signifies a crucial evolution, anticipating an accelerated adoption of advanced technology,” says Rani Ratna, senior research manager at IDC Asia/Pacific, regarding the report’s findings.\n“This shift is poised to bring substantial improvements, ranging from heightened productivity to more engaged workforces. The immediate focus is on use cases that enhance short-term productivity and efficiency, with a long-term vision encompassing broader ecosystem integration and an increased emphasis on sustainability,” Ratna adds.\nSo, is AI the remedy for long-standing supply chain issues facing risk managers, or just a placebo — or worse, a snake oil cure?\nWHAT CHALLENGES CAN AI ADDRESS?\n“AI is not new to supply chain practice,” notes Ayoub Abielmona, EY Global GenAI supply chain leader. “It has been solving supply chain headaches for decades, with its ability to automate repetitive tasks, detect patterns, and make predictions based on historical data.\n“It has played a significant role in various areas, such as inventory optimisation, route planning, production scheduling, forecasting supply and demand, warehouse management through robotics, and customer service via chatbots.”\nAbielmona asserts that while these tools have been effective in providing analysis and recommendations, they have not yet gone far enough to help supply chains become more agile and resilient in the face of market disruption and global volatility.\n“Many of the robots we see deployed in factories and warehouses today are powered by machine learning.”\nTess Frenzel, a senior principal in Gartner’s supply chain practice, says there are many challenges that supply chain leaders are trying to tackle with AI. “These include making better predictions to manage risks and inventory, supporting and automating decisions, and improving data quality,” she says.\n“Some supply chains are also looking to AI to reduce labour costs. Many of the robots we see deployed in factories and warehouses today are powered by machine learning.”\nFor Frenzel, how effective these tools are in addressing supply chain challenges depends on the digital maturity of an organisation and a team’s willingness to embrace the technology. “Supply chains need the right culture and digital infrastructure for successful AI adoption,” she says.\nPOTENTIAL PITFALLS\nAccording to Abielmona, while AI risks and pitfalls have always existed, generative AI increases the risks in four key areas: trust and accuracy, privacy and security, fairness and bias, and legal and regulatory compliance.\n“To address these concerns, AI systems should be developed under a responsible AI governance framework, with policies and procedures that promote accountability across the development cycle, protect data privacy, ensure compliance with evolving regulations, and mitigate potential biases,” she says.\n“It’s imperative that AI systems are built with appropriate levels of transparency and explainability regarding their purpose, design and deployment to ensure end users can evaluate and correctly employ AI outputs. The decision criteria of AI systems should be reasonably understood by human operators so that results can be easily explained, validated, and challenged if necessary, for accuracy and bias.”\n“If you don’t fix your data quality issues before implementing AI use cases, you won’t get the most out of your investment.”\nMost traditional AI use cases require historical data, and when past trends no longer hold true in the present, AI-based forecasting can mislead supply chains.\n“We’ve seen that in real time, with economic forecasts being largely wrong over the past three years,” Frenzel says. “Having a human in the loop prepared to override a system if things go awry and provide oversight for edge cases is critical for risk mitigation.”\nFrenzel also pointed out that the phrase “garbage in, garbage out” holds true for AI in supply chain management. “If you don’t fix your data quality issues before implementing AI use cases, you won’t get the most out of your investment.”\nSELF-DRIVING ECOSYSTEMS\nAbielmona predicted that over the next five to 10 years, as AI becomes embedded in every software solution, supply chains will shift from rigid, linear silos to fully autonomous, self-driving ecosystems that can operate independently, learn from their environment, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.\n“This journey towards autonomy, while contemplated for decades, is now possible due to recent advances in technologies like GenAI and the increased speed and access to multi-modal data that it unlocks,” Abielmona said.\n“Without addressing the data access problem, AI’s rapid progress may stall”\n“Autonomous supply chains will go beyond predicting demand fluctuations and making recommendations — they will execute tasks on our behalf, such as adjusting production schedules, rerouting logistics in response to disruptions, and even negotiating with suppliers and customers.”\nFrenzel said that according to Gartner’s Hype Cycle for Supply Chain Strategy, AI will become widely productive in supply chain management over the next five to 10 years. “Trends for AI that supply chain leaders should continue to monitor include the energy and resource costs associated with AI and the threat of a ‘data wall’ undermining AI’s progress.\n“AI-supported tools are energy and resource-intensive. Moreover, much of the high-quality data used to train systems like large language models is expected to be depleted in the coming years. Without addressing the data access problem, AI’s rapid progress may stall,” Frenzel warned.\nNo comments\nSign up to our newsletters\nClick to add/manage email newsletters\nAdestra!7856\nSRGEuroNewsletter\nAdestra!7863\nSRGCyberNewsletter\nSRGESGNewsletter\nSent to:\nEdit\nNo comments yet\nYou're not signed in.\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nSign in\nRegister\nMore Supply Chain Risk\nChina’s rare earth export curbs escalate global supply chain risks\nCase study: How Ukrainian furniture makers are staying resilient and relevant despite the challenges of war\nRisk briefing: When to walk away from a third-party supplier\nThe rise and rise of ‘China Plus One’ risk strategies\nRisk briefing: how to improve ESG risk measurement throughout the supply chain\nWhy AI could hold the key to improving third-party supplier risk assessment\nLoad more articles\nContact us\nTerms & Conditions\nPrivacy\nAdChoices\nCookies\nFAQ\nFollow Strategic Risk\nSign In\nForgotten Password\nContributors\nFeedback\nMedia Pack\n© StrategicRISK 2025\nPart of the Insurance and Risk group of\nNewsquest Specialist Media\nPublished by Newsquest Media Group Limited,\nregistered in England & Wales with number 01676637\nat 1st Floor, Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street,\nNewport, Wales, NP20 1DW - a Gannett company\nSite powered by Webvision Cloud",

If you do contribute material, you will be deemed to be doing so in full knowledge and acceptance of these Terms. If you have any questions, please contact the relevant Editor.\nGeneral\nUnless otherwise agreed in writing by a local publisher, these Terms apply to all Publications (including the title publishing these Terms) produced by a company within the Newsquest Media Group in England and Wales, all being subsidiary companies of Gannett U.K. Limited. Your agreement is with the Newsquest Media Group publishing company producing the relevant Publication (\"we\", \"us\"  \"our\").  Local terms apply to Publications produced by Newsquest (Herald & Times) Limited in Scotland and external contributors must check the local websites or enquire directly.  Otherwise, these Terms set out our agreement with professional freelances (including news and photo agencies) and other external contributors to our Publications, including bloggers and 'citizen journalists' who are authorised by us in writing to upload blogs to our websites, (in each case \"you\" or \"your\").\nThe Works of non-commissioned casual contributors of user-generated content (\"UGC\")  to our websites, including website comment pages, are not governed by these Terms, but rather by local user terms published on the relevant website itself.  UGC is not edited, selected or otherwise pre-moderated by us but uploaded directly by the contributor, who is liable in law for such material.\nIn these Terms:\n\"Publication\" means any title or other publication (existing now created in the future) in any medium or format (whether such medium exists now or is invented in the future), however accessed, distributed or stored (including print, online, electronic, broadcast, and telephonic media, access or distribution by PC or mobile or tablet apps or other portable devices, or access, distribution or storage on disc or tape or any other platform or means) and in all that publication's issues, editions, versions, parts, supplements and archives.\n\"Work\" means any copyright work as defined in copyright legislation (including written material, photographs, sound, video and graphic materials) and covers unused Work intended for use by us as well background Work gathered or created in connection with a Work which is intended for use. Work includes any Work commissioned by us from freelances (including commissioned 'bloggers' or 'citizen journalists' online) or which is submitted speculatively to us and accepted by us in writing.\nReferences to the \"use\" of a Work by us include reproduction, display, publication, transmission, distribution, storage and any other use or re-use.\nAny words following the words 'including', 'include', 'in particular', 'for example' or any similar expression shall be construed as illustrative and shall not limit the sense of the words, description, definition, phrase or term preceding those words.\nUnless the context otherwise requires, words in the singular shall include the plural and in the plural shall include the singular.\nNotices required to be in writing may include emails.\nBy submitting to us any Work for our use, or by agreeing to prepare Work or by using any of our websites, you agree to be legally bound by these Terms which will take effect immediately.  If you do not agree to be legally bound by all of the Terms you must not  accept a commission from us for any Work or offer your Work for use by us. If you do, you will be deemed to have read, agreed and accepted these Terms.\nThis agreement replaces and supersedes any existing agreement between you and us in relation to your Work, which automatically ends on your submission of Work to us under these Terms.\nThis agreement between you and us is subject to the laws and the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.\nNo variation\nThese Terms cannot be varied except with the express written agreement of the Editor of the relevant Publication.  We may change these Terms at any time and it is your sole responsibility to check online for any changes before you offer any Work or accept any commission from us to produce Work. Any Work supplied to us for use is deemed to have been supplied in acceptance of the most recent version of the Terms as displayed on the relevant Publication's website at the time of your contribution or commission.  Your continued or renewed contribution of Work after such changes are posted means you agree to be bound by these Terms as they have been amended.\nGrant of rights in the Work\nThe legal copyright in the Work is retained by you. By your agreement to these Terms,  you give us the rights in the Work which are set out below. Subject to these Terms and in particular the proviso for commissioned Work below,  Our rights in the Work  are non-exclusive, which means that you can also use the Work as you wish at the same time as we use it.\nWhere a Work is specifically commissioned by us or you are a commissioned blogger or citizen journalist, you give us the exclusive right to first use of the Work in any medium as permitted by these Terms.  If there is a delay of more than 90 days from our receipt of the Work to its first use by us, then you may apply to the Editor for a written waiver of our exclusive right to first use, which will not be unreasonably refused.\nWhile you retain copyright in the Work, We shall have the following rights (some of which may overlap), which are worldwide, perpetual irrevocable and sub-licensable:\nthe right to use and re-use the Work in any of our Publications;\nthe right to syndicate, distribute and license the Work to third parties;\nthe rights to use the title, format and any pseudonym associated with the Work;\nthe right to store your Work in any archive or database in any medium or format existing now or created in the future and to make such archive or database available to the public (whether or not for a fee);\nthe right to edit, amend, cut, translate  or otherwise alter your Work as we may consider appropriate;\nthe right to authorise the Newspaper Licensing Agency (\"NLA\") to distribute or license the distribution of your Work (or links to your Work in our online Publications, archives or databases) for its licensed purposes as may be amended from time to time;\nthe right to authorise third party information providers to use your Work as published or otherwise used in our Publications in their databases (in any medium or format and on any platform)  for search and copying by their end users;\nThe right to use the Work and any image of you or other personal details for the purposes of publicity  or marketing or any other purpose in connection with the exercise of our rights under this agreement with you.\nIf you exercise any of your retained rights in respect of the Work, you agree to ensure that your use will not conflict with our use of the Work or any other of our legitimate commercial interests, and you will procure an acknowledgement to us and our relevant Publication in any further use you might make of your Work, together with a link to the Work on our relevant website wherever possible.\nYou acknowledge that as a matter of law moral rights do not arise in connection with current affairs reporting or any publication in newspapers or magazines, but to the extent that moral rights may be applicable to any use of a Work permitted under this agreement you waive them unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Editor.\nPayment\nMany Works are commissioned or accepted by us without payment of a fee.  In any such case, you agree that the opportunity to have your Work published or considered for use by us is adequate consideration for the rights granted to us in this agreement. No fee will be payable unless the Editor of the relevant Publication has expressly agreed in writing in advance of commission or acceptance to pay you a fee for your Work. If a fee is agreed, it will be a single all-inclusive fee for all the rights granted above.  The fee will be fixed at our prevailing standard rates, as may be published and varied from time to time, unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the Editor.  The fee includes the cost of delivering the Work and all customary expenses incurred by you in researching and creating it.  Any additional expenses or payments must be approved in advance by the Editor in writing.  Provided that the Work is delivered and complies with these Terms (and any additional or substitute terms agreed in writing), payment will be made at the end of the month following the month of our first use of the Work.  In respect of a Work that we have agreed to pay for, we will also pay you 50% of the net revenue actually received by us in respect of a one-off syndication of an individual Work of yours to an end-user customer of ours for print publication.\nNo obligation\nWe are not under any obligation to use your Work. If we have commissioned a Work from you and a payment is agreed but we do not use the Work, you will be paid in full subject to these Terms (unless the Work has been rejected because it does not comply with our editorial standards).  If you are not commissioned but submit a Work speculatively and it is initially accepted for use for an agreed fee though we decide later not to use it for any reason, you will not receive a fee but all rights in the Work will revert to you.  No Work is accepted under these Terms unless and until it is expressly accepted in writing (including email) by the Editor or by an authorised person acting on the Editor's behalf or it is actually used by us in a Publication.\nYour warranties and indemnity\nYou warrant in respect of the Work you offer or contribute that:\nit is your own original work and (unless otherwise stated by you in writing) it has not been previously published in print or online;\nyou have obtained any necessary consent or licence required for our use of the Work and our acceptance or use of the Work will not infringe any person's rights, including copyright and other  intellectual property rights, performance rights, or rights of privacy or confidentiality, data protection or any other right;\nin producing your Work you have complied with the Data Protection Act 1998;\nyour Work is not defamatory of any person or other legal entity; and\nour acceptance or use of the Work will not put us in contempt of court or otherwise in breach of civil or criminal law (including laws relating to harassment, trespass, bribery or disclosure of personal data).\nYou agree to indemnify us fully against all damages, losses, costs and expenses (including reasonable legal costs) and other liabilities incurred or suffered by us as a result of any claim from a third party arising from or in connection with your breach of your warranties or other obligations under these Terms.\nOur editorial standards\nOur reputation is very important to us. You agree that you will produce the Work to the highest professional and ethical standards, including compliance with the Editorial Code of Practice of the Independent Press Standards Organisation.\nWe reserve the right to reject a Work (and cancel any agreed fee) that in our opinion:\ndoes not comply with the Editorial Code of Practice or which otherwise puts you in breach of these Terms;  or\ndoes not achieve a suitable standard of editorial quality.\nIn respect of any Work of Yours that has been commissioned, accepted or used by us:\nyou will tell the Editor of our relevant Publication without delay if you become aware at any time of any information that may cast doubt on information or claims affecting or contained in your Work or any other legal or compliance risk relating to the Work; and\nif you become aware of any complaint about your Work at any time, you  should not reply to the complainant but rather notify the Editor of our relevant Publication immediately in writing.\nWe will have sole control over the handling of any complaint about your Work and you will co-operate fully with us in order to resolve it. You will ensure that you keep all your notes and research materials and, if we ask, you will provide us with such notes and materials, together with all other relevant background information and access to your sources where reasonably necessary for compliance or legal purposes. You will not mention or discuss a complaint with any person without the Editor's prior written approval.\nSelf-employed\nYou confirm in respect of your contribution of any Work that you are an independent self-employed contractor and we shall not be liable for any of your acts or omissions in connection with the Work you submit.
