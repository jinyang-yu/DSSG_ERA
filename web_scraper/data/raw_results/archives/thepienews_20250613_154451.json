Photo: iStock Kuzmichstudio\nThe Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents private schools in the UK, argued that the controversial policy requiring schools to pay VAT on their fees was discriminatory and contrary to human rights. But three High Court judges have today dismissed the case, with the ISC plotting its next move.\nIt’s the latest step in a furious legal battle as private schools scrambled to try and overturn the policy, fearing that their student numbers could plummet as families are no longer able to afford higher fees.\nIn their judgement, Dame Victoria Sharp, Lord Justice Newey and Mr Justice Chamberlain found that, although some families would no longer be able to send their children to private schools, these factors were “outweighed by the expected revenue raised for public services”. The money raised via the policy will be redirected into state education, as part of a major Labour election policy last year.\nAnd although the judges acknowledged that children with special educational needs or disabilities or those observing certain religions would be negatively impacted by the policy, they pointed out that the government had followed all the necessary processes to see it made into law – including a full parliamentary debate.\nISC CEO Julie Robinson doubled down on her criticism of the policy, which she slammed as an “unprecedented tax on education”. She said that the ISC was “carefully considering” the judgement and planning its next steps.\n“Our focus remains on supporting schools, families and children. We will continue to work to ensure the government is held to account over the negative impact this tax on education is having across independent and state schools,” she said.\nCommenting on the case, Robert Lewis, partner and head of the education group at Mishcon de Reya, acknowledged that the ruling would be a “disappointment to independent schools and the families who entrust them with their children’s education”.\n“From the outset, the claim faced formidable legal obstacles: it sought to overturn a fully democratically endorsed policy; one introduced in the Labour manifesto, debated in Parliament, and enacted into law,” he said.\n“Nonetheless, the judgment does offer a modest but meaningful silver lining for independent schools. It observes that an outright ban on independent schools would likely breach the United Kingdom’s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.”\nThe VAT policy has been roundly criticised by the K-12 sector in the UK, many of which are home to international students, leading to fears from independent boarding schools that their intake could plummet.\nNonetheless, the judgment does offer a modest but meaningful silver lining for independent schools\nRobert Lewis, Mishcon de Reya\nExperts predicted that most schools would be forced to raise their fees an average of 10-15% to cover costs, although an online private school told The PIE News  that it has seen a “five-fold” surge in interest from parents since the VAT policy was announced last year due to its relative value for money.\nBeth Kennedy\nBeth Kennedy is a journalist and editor with 10 years experience in specialist media.

Image: The PIE\nRestrictive immigration policy in Australia has boosted numbers coming to UK.\n75% of the market is searching for undergraduate options with affordable fees.\nMedium-of-instruction (MOI) English language waivers are common, and often linked to TNE college partnerships.\nNepal has been a key recruitment market for both Australia and the UK for many years – but as the number of students applying to the UK rises, many more universities are starting to explore the market.\nIn the year ending March 2024, according to ONS data, 9,003 Nepalese students were issued study visas for the UK, with the number undoubtedly larger for the intakes since.\nAccording to Enroly, the number of CASs issued for the January 2025 intake was up 200% while CAS issuance for its entire UK portfolio was only up 23%. Overall, the total market share of CAS issuance for Nepal grew from 3% to 7% in 2024.\nThis impressive growth has come at a time when some British universities have seen falling demand from other international markets, and the government has announced a student visa clamp-down on Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria and Sri Lanka – linked to asylum claims.\nSo why are Nepalese students choosing the UK and will it last?\nOver 60,000 Nepalese students previously chose to study in Australia each year, making it the third biggest source market for the country.\nRecent visa restrictions imposed by the Albanese government, however, are now forcing many students to seek an alternative destination.\nWhile the Australian visa process requires detailed evidence on income, the UK system allows students to show a mature bank account, often supplemented by private student loans.\nEnroly estimates that 78% of Nepalese students are now funded through education loans, or a combination of an education loan and university discount.\nAffordable fees and scholarships\nDespite economic growth, projected to be 4.61% this fiscal year, Nepal is still a price-senstitive market.\nAs a consequence, there are 15-20 British universities from the ‘Million Plus’ and ‘Alliance’ groups attracting a large market share in the country.\nMany of these institutions are the same UK universities that are diversifying income through franchise activity, brand campuses and TNE articulations.\nOffering average annual fees of between £11,500 and £13,500 enables them to attract a large number of predominently undergraduate students to supplement their numbers.\nAccording to HESA statistics, some of the biggest recruiters are BPP, University of Sunderland and Coventry University.\nThe latter have validation partnerships with local providers such as ISMT College and Softwarica College of IT and eCommerce, respectively, creating a pipeline of students that can top-up with a final year in the UK or progress easily on to masters degree.\nThe UK universities recruiting the most students from Nepal:\nUniversity of West Scotland, London\nBPP\nCoventry University\nUniversity of Sunderland\nUniversity of Roehampton\nYork St John University\nRavensbourne University London\nUniversity of East London (UEL)\nUniversity of West London\nUniversity of Wolverhampton\nUniversity of Central Birmingham (UCB)\nUniversity of Hertfordshire\nUniversity of Greenwich\nUlster University\nThe trend for universities to accept Nepalese students directly has significantly reduced the demand for foundation programmes in the region.\nAccpetance of MOI letters as proof of English\nAnother key factor is the widespread acceptance of MOI letters as a waiver of additional English language tests.\nThese letters are used as proof that the qualification gained by a prosepctive student was both taught and assessed in English to a level acdepted by a university as having met English language requirements. The UK government is currently consulting with the sector on the way universities make English language self-assessment decisions for admissions purposes.\nAgents and immigration consultants use English language waivers as one of the areas to save prospective students money and support partner universities.\nAccording to Enroly, 82% of course deposits paid by Nepalese students for the UK, come from applications supported by an education agent.\nThe PIE News visited Nepal to better understand the challenges education agents face in a competitive market.

Photo: Pexels\nJonathan Bii, governor of Uasin Gishu, one of Kenya’s prominent counties, is now facing legal scrutiny over his alleged involvement in the controversial Uasin Gishu Finland/Canada Scholarship Program.\nBii, a member of the United Democratic Alliance, an affiliate of Kenya’s ruling coalition, is accused of supporting the scholarship scheme and requesting additional payments from students.\nAs per media reports, he later distanced himself from the initiative amid allegations of misappropriation of over KSh 1.1 billion meant for scholarships.\nIndividual accounts by parents of the students revealed that payments ranged from KSh 650,000 to over KSh 1.2 million (approximately USD$5,000–$9,230), with some families reportedly paying up to KSh 3 million (around USD$23,100).\nThese amounts covered expenses such as tuition, visa and insurance fees, and accommodation deposits.\nKenyan news outlet Daily Nation reported that a key witness, Mitchelle Jeptanui, testified before senior principal magistrate Peter Ndege that in June 2023, Bii held a meeting with parents to assure them that the overseas trip would receive approval shortly.\nThe parents, already anxious as their children had received admission letters from universities in Canada and Finland, were allegedly asked to pay an additional KSh 200,000 to KSh 300,000 (approximately USD$1,540 to $2,310) for accommodation fees.\nHowever, despite the payments, none of the students were able to travel abroad.\nMy son never travelled. I am still hoping either for a refund or support for him to go\nBenjamin Kibet, parent\nWhen parents once again demanded answers, Bii allegedly shifted the blame to his predecessor, Jackson Mandago, who initiated the program.\nHowever, testimony from seven out of eight witnesses last week confirmed they made their payments after Bii assumed office.\nBenjamin Kibet, a parent of one of the affected student, told the court that he took out a loan of KSh 650,000 (around USD$5,000) to fund his son’s education at Stenberg College in Canada, after being introduced to the programme by Mandago and Bii.\n“My son never travelled. I am still hoping either for a refund or support for him to go,” Kibet told reporters.\nAs the case unfolds, Mandago, along with former county officials Meshack Rono and Joshua Lelei, is expected to face criminal charges related to the alleged misappropriation of the scholarship funds.\nOver the past two years, the scandal has shaken Kenya’s growing middle class, who have aspirations for overseas education.\nA 2020 survey had found that more than half of Kenyan students preferred studying at international universities over local institutions.\nMoreover, Kenya has been identified as a “high-growth potential” source market for international education.\nIt ranked as the leading East African market for US universities, with enrolments rising by 45% in 2022 compared to 2019.\nCanadian institutions, a key draw for many of the students who ultimately became entangled in the scholarship scandal, also recorded a 12% rise in Kenyan student enrolments during the same period.\nKenyan parents have taken to the streets across Uasin Gishu County over the past few years, demanding answers, as the scandal has left over 300 students stranded at home.\nMany of them have reportedly been expelled from Finnish universities or deported, as previously reported by The PIE News.\nAbhishek Nair\nAbhishek Nair is a freelance journalist based out of Mumbai, with experience in covering sports and education across India. He has completed his post graduation in Communication and Journalism, and has been covering international education for the past two years.

Photo: iStock.\nAs the freeze – initially intended to last a few days – stretches into its third week, sector leaders are increasingly frustrated about the lack of communication from the State Department, with impacts compounded with every day that passes.\n“The proof, ultimately, will be not in the promises but in the appointments,” Mark Overmann, executive director of the Alliance for International Exchange told The PIE News.\nWhile welcoming positive signs that the department is “inching towards final policy changes and that appointments should restart very soon”, the lack of government clarity is wreaking havoc on the sector and is starting to take its toll on US businesses.\nIt is estimated that 3% of international participants due to take part in the department’s own Summer Work Travel and Camp Counsellor programs do not yet have visa appointments and are at risk of not being able to enter the US due to the ongoing freeze.\n“These numbers are not insignificant and encompass several thousand young international participants and hundreds of American host businesses and summer camps,” said Overmann.\nThe US has a long history of inviting young people to take part in summer exchange programs under the government’s BridgeUSA program, attracting around 300,000 short-term visitors from 200 countries every year.\nThe proof, ultimately, will be not in the promises but in the appointments\nMark Overmann, Alliance of International Exchange\nConsidered an important diplomatic tool as well as vital to the country’s seasonal labour demands, visitors come for study and research opportunities, to take internships, enhance English language schools and teach in US learning institutions.\nFor those with rolling or concentrated fall arrivals, the continuing freeze is particularly concerning, highlighted Overmann, with au pairs, teachers, high school students, interns and trainees increasingly uncertain about their ability to get a visitor visa in time.\nAs previously reported by The PIE, the impact on international college students is also compounding every day, with at least half of new students still needing to schedule visa interview appointments to arrive in time for the fall quarter.\nSince the announcement of the suspension on May 27, the state department has continued to send positive signals that visa scheduling will soon reopen, raising hopes of students and stakeholders alike.\nOn June 11, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce reiterated the position that the pause would not be “an ongoing or lengthy dynamic”, urging students to watch for the reopening of visa interviews and “continue to apply”.\nBruce also vowed to provide an update on June 12, which stakeholders say was cancelled.\nOn May 27, stated rationale for the pause was for consulates and embassies to prepare for “an expansion of required social media screening and vetting”, though there have been no further details about what this might look like.\nPolly Nash\nPolly graduated with a degree in History and English Literature from the University of Edinburgh during which she did a year abroad in sunny Santa Barbara.

Photo: iStock.\nThe UK has taken the top spot for student demand in Keystone Education Group’s 2025 student recruitment report, while the growing diversification of study destinations beyond the ‘big four’ continues to define the global mobility landscape.\nThe report, due to be published on June 18, captures the sector at a moment of “transformation”, said Keystone CEO Fredrik Högemark, as financial pressure fuels rising interest in non-traditional study destinations particularly in Europe and Asia.\nMeanwhile, new data from ApplyBoard has revealed a “promising turnaround” in international student demand for UK study visas, with Q1 2025 seeing the issuance of over 48,000 visas, up 27% from the same period in 2024.\nCrucially, the grant rate was 88% in both quarters, meaning the increase in visa issuance reflects stronger demand rather than changes in approval rates, ApplyBoard explained.\nIndia accounted for over 18,000 visa applications during Q1, marking a 29% increase on the previous year and maintaining its position as the UK’s top source market that quarter.\nThis recovery is particularly promising given the softening of Indian student demand across the ‘big four’ markets throughout 2024, ApplyBoard highlighted.\nPakistan and Nepal followed India as the largest source markets, with the greatest increases on the previous year seen by Bangladesh (+135%) and Nepal (122+).\nDespite an earlier report identifying the UK as the most attractive study destination for Chinese students, the number of Chinese visa applications to the UK fell by 8% in Q1 2025, a possible reflection of the continued growth of intra-East Asian mobility.\nAfter a period of UK policy turbulence – including a review of the UK’s post-study work visa and the crackdown on visas issued to dependants of most international students – the rising demand marks the second consecutive quarter of stabilisation in the UK.\n“While the UK’s international education sector appears to be on the mend, the recently released 2025 immigration white paper could have far-reaching effects,” warned ApplyBoard, highlighting the proposed reduction of the Graduate Route from 24 to 28 months.\nAnd yet, an early student interest survey indicated that interest in the UK remains “robust” and has not been significantly hampered by the white paper, likely due to the restrictions and policy volatility rocking the US, Australia and Canada.\nThe results of this year’s survey paint a picture of a higher education sector under financial pressure and transformation\nFredrik Högemark, Keystone Education Group\nAs for Keystone’s findings, Högemark singled out South Korea’s increasing popularity, which has entered the top 10 for the first time since the inception of the survey, and is the only Asian destination in the cohort.\nMeanwhile, interest in European destinations at the master’s level grew by 7% from January to April this year, with Germany moving into third position behind the UK and US for master’s students.\nElsewhere, the report highlighted the growing price sensitivity of students, who are increasingly expecting to be able to work alongside their studies.\nAs such, 47% of the 42,000 students surveyed said they would work while studying, “indicating that traditional funding routes, such as scholarships, family support and government loans, are not meeting the rising costs of studying,” observed Högemark.\n“Students are becoming more pragmatic and outcomes-focused, prioritising affordability, employability, and practical skills over prestige and rankings,” he said, highlighting that universities can no longer rely solely on reputation to recruit international students.\nPolly Nash\nPolly graduated with a degree in History and English Literature from the University of Edinburgh during which she did a year abroad in sunny Santa Barbara.

As demand holds steady but internal pressures mount, many are reassessing how key processes – from applications to payments – are managed across increasingly complex systems.\nby The View From\nJune 13 2025\n3 Min Read\nShare\nCopied!\n0\nAdd Your Opinion\nSponsored\nPhoto: Flywire\nWhile rapidly changing policies make for a dynamic landscape, underlying demand from international students remains strong. Universities are having to do so much to stay relevant and competitive in this fast-paced, changeable environment, and internal resources are being stretched to their limits.\nBut, focusing on what they can control, reviewing and optimising critical processes, and investing in robust, integrated systems is one way universities can secure their future success in this evolving landscape.\nInstead of fragmented systems, universities need integrated solutions to address the specific pain points of international education, from application processing and tuition fee collection to managing global agent networks. This is not merely about efficiency; it’s about building resilience. Streamlining and simplifying complex and time-consuming processes will reduce administrative burden, enhance the student experience, and build a foundation for future growth and prosperity.\n1. Automate more of the application process\nThe ICEF Agent Voice Report 2024 revealed education agents value fast application processing from partner institutions as well as rapid responses to queries/issues. Cumbersome or slow application processes can deter prospective students and the agents who support them.\nInstitutions can streamline document submission and review processes, as well as automate things that tend to bog the process down – such as offering up necessary insurance products – within the workflow. This efficiency boosts agility and helps teams act quickly, significantly enhancing the student experience to boost conversion rates.\n2. Make international payments easier\nPayment is a point of unnecessary friction and stress for many international students and their families, who are often unfamiliar with cross-border payments and rely heavily on education agents for advice and support. In fact, the ICEF Agent Voice 2024 data revealed that the majority of agents assist students with payments, sometimes even by making the payment on the student’s behalf. Students and their families need access to information in their local language and time zone if they have questions or issues.\nInstead of fragmented systems, universities need integrated solutions to address the specific pain points of international education\nShort payments due to FX can cause ripple effects – holding up reconciliation and delaying steps needed for students to secure enrollment – as can missing ID information, adding to student anxieties. Providing transparent, localised, and digital payment experiences is essential for student satisfaction and retention.\n3. Strengthen agent partnerships\nEducation agents remain crucial partners for institutions in their efforts to recruit students across the globe. Efficient management of these partnerships, including comprehensive training, swift query response, transparency and timely commission payments, helps foster stronger relationships and incentivises agents to prioritise your institution. According to the 2024 ICEF Agent Voice report, 86% would value more training from their partner institutions signalling that they too want to build stronger relationships.\nCritically, leveraging technology will be the key to simplifying and streamlining processes and building resilience. Connecting agent management, application and payment workflows will deliver significant operational efficiencies and allow teams across campus to focus on other valuable initiatives such as improving student support or expanding recruitment to new markets.\nAt the same time, integrating systems will automate manual tasks and accelerate financial reconciliation, reducing errors and improving response times, while ensuring compliance, mitigating fraud risks and enhancing overall stability. Moreover, integration can deliver valuable data insights on student origins, payment trends, and agent performance, empowering universities to make more informed strategic decisions.\nFor more information on how Flywire connects the international education ecosystem to drive institutional success and stability in the face of uncertainty, visit www.flywire.com.\nAbout the author: Mina Fakhouri is senior vice president of education sales APAC & global agents at Flywire\nThe View From\nThe View From is The PIE's opinion piece section, and presents an opportunity for your organisation to write an opinion piece in international education.

Student enabler.\nWhat do you like most about your job?\nI love interacting with students, I get infected by their energy, which reeks of the aspiration to study abroad, explore new destinations, and explore new challenges in their lives. I love that I can make their journeys and experiences more convenient, and enable their dreams so they don’t have to downsize their dreams of studying abroad. Not letting any deserving student fall short on finances is what I’m really passionate about.\nBest work trip?\nI really love New York – the place has a good vibe, for sure. I was there just last week and I met lots of Indian students at different universities: Columbia, SUNY Buffalo, NJIT, Pace University, NYU… a real range.\nIf you could learn a language instantly, which would you pick and why?\nLanguage? If I could understand the language of the heart and understand what people are thinking that would be the best, so then I could understand what expectations people might have from Credila. I would love to make their journeys more convenient and more palatable.\nWhat makes you get up in the morning?\nMy busy schedule and the alarms in my calendar.\nBest international ed conference and why?\nI think NAFSA is amazing. I’ve never seen so many exhibitors or experienced the kind of energy that NAFSA carries. The sheer number of exhibitors overwhelms you, so I believe NAFSA has to be the one. It’s amazing.\nWorst conference food/beverage experience?\nI’m a vegetarian, so when I don’t find anything vegetarian, it’s a nightmare for me. I have to survive on bread and cheese.\nBook or podcast recommendation for others in the sector?\nNaval Ravikant – I simply adore that guy. Amazing guy.\nDescribe a project or initiative you’re currently working on that excites you.\nWe are working on the undergraduate segment. So, Credila has been very dominant on the graduate programs. Now we want to focus on the undergraduate side of things, so we’ll reach out to undergraduate applicants in overseas markets.\nThe second is, we’re also very excited to look at domestic undergraduate segments as well, so UG is something we’re increasingly focussed on now.\nPolly Nash\nPolly graduated with a degree in History and English Literature from the University of Edinburgh during which she did a year abroad in sunny Santa Barbara.

The account was sadly unattributed, and therefore it is difficult to effectively evaluate the clearly problematic circumstances.\nThat said, this is a perspective that many in higher education have heard before. The National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC) indicates that the majority of its member institutions currently do not work with agents because of ethical concerns.\nWhile there are many excellent agents, I have no doubt there are also unethical companies – the so-called “bad actors”. Inevitably, there is a continuum of commitment, quality, and service, as with any business sector. It is therefore necessary to step back and consider why universities, parents and prospective students utilise agents in the first place, and what the responsibilities of the university sector are when considering whether to work with agents.\nToday, I work for Acumen, a leading international education consultancy, having spent 28 years in US higher education, 15 as an SIO. I have worked with large agencies and trust this perspective is useful when putting the recent PIE article into context.\nLet’s begin with the parents and students and their concerns. In contemplating any overseas institution, the family is making a substantial financial commitment, as even after scholarships the cost of attendance for any four-year baccalaureate in the US can easily reach $120,000 and range to $250,000.\nFor all but the financial elite, international studies represent the investment of a lifetime and this becomes a deeply transactional decision. This proposition, which may assume post-graduate Optional Practical Training, explains why most international students are laser focused on their studies, and see a US degree as a stepping stone to a career that may be unattainable otherwise.\nMost families will survey their options using world rankings – but even here, they must be skeptical\nWhile these families look at many countries, the US is still considered by many to be the best academic proposition. But where do they start to gather information?\nMost families will survey their options using world rankings – but even here, they must be skeptical. For example, there are 29 US universities ranked higher than the leading ranked Indian institution in the QS 2025 rankings. These rankings lead to all kinds of erroneous assumptions, including the idea that US private universities are automatically better than publics, that community colleges aren’t ‘worth’ considering and that all reputable institutions are expensive. In part, this explains why, according to Open Doors, 25% of all international students study at just 20 highly ranked universities in the United States.\nWe should also consider the family rarely sees university representatives. Unless that institution has the significant benefit of having 24/7 in-country representation by a trained individual working exclusively for the university, you are likely using an occasional ‘fly in/fly out’ model, bringing admissions staff once or twice a year. Given the need to justify that cost, most college recruiters either sign up for a prescribed agenda of recruitment fairs and school visits, or follow a well-worn path of prior visits that maintains a network of relationships.\nBoth are good strategies given the very occasional nature of the work, but inevitably universities will concentrate efforts in the big cosmopolitan cities. This is a problem. The 2011 census notes 46 Indian cities with over one million people but when was the last time your international recruiters visited Thane, Vadodara, Nashik, Bhopal, Nagpur or Ludhiana?\nIn this context, little wonder parents and students look elsewhere for advice. They want to have the trust of someone they can meet in-person on multiple occasions, who appears to be successful, and who speaks with confidence about future academic options. This isn’t a socio-cultural anomaly, it is a cultural norm.\nThe danger of the recent PIE piece is that it ignores these complicated and culturally located processes. It dismisses agencies, paying no attention to how most parents and students try to understand the complex and confusing behemoth that is US higher education.\nThere are alternatives to agencies such as international education consultancies supporting in-country representation, but US higher education must strategically plan for the perspectives of the international student and their families in this process. There is no room for an attitude of American exceptionality in an extraordinarily competitive global environment.\nSo what is to be done? US institutions have, in simple terms, three choices when considering working with agents:\nUniversities can choose not to work with agents, electing to reuse domestic admissions processes, hopefully with some adaptions, and sending a small team of recruiters overseas sporadically. This is an expensive proposition but given the tuition premium of international students, many universities are happy to utilise this ‘fly in – fly out’ model and maintain control of the process. Other universities recognising these pitfalls choose to work with international education consultancies to employ in-country representatives to market and recruit directly from specific countries on the basis of service, not commission.\nUniversities can choose to work with agents but have those agreements monitored. Those same international education consultancies can, precisely because they are not agencies, educate, the advise and offer quality oversight for the agent agreements that universities hold. They can be the eyes and ears of the university in-country, and train the agencies ensuring they are thoroughly educated on the institutional proposition.\nFinally, universities can choose to work with agencies. Given the central role that agents play in many family decisions, and the fact that large agencies can recruit significant numbers of students while organising the recruitment/application process, working with agents can be an important part of the admissions strategy. Quality assurance and ethical behaviour then become central to the development of trust. In this regard, I strongly encourage universities to work with agencies that are recognised by either AIRC or ICEF.\nShould universities decide to work with agents, as many do, it becomes critical that admissions personnel also maintain their responsibility back on campus. The university is accountable for the careful oversight of the agent contract – particularly as the large consolidators that utilise a sub-agency model have sophisticated business plans.\nSimply put, universities must take the responsibility of oversight seriously, or ask a consultancy to do so\nTherefore universities must:\nUnderstand, indeed dictate, how the brand is represented in the marketplace.\nConduct due diligence that includes speaking with other universities represented by the agent, well beyond the references offered.\nAppreciate the full cost of the commission, whereby agent payments may be 10-20% of first year tuition, and sometimes feature additional payments beyond the first year.\nWork closely with the student and academic affairs leadership to ensure international student success is prioritized across the campus community. Any institutional failure to fully commit, such as inadequate turnaround times, or a lack of current marketing materials will tarnish your global reputation quickly.\nUnderstand that agents do not control market forces and cannot guarantee meeting a projected admissions target – or not without facing a potential reallocation of students from other universities to do so. This can be problematic in a ‘down’ year and can result in an ethical dilemma for both the agents and the university. Be sure you complete careful due diligence when agreeing to the business model.\nSimply put, universities must take the responsibility of oversight seriously, or ask a consultancy to do so. Procurement processes must avoid exclusivity clauses and lengthy five-to-10-year contracts (or even longer). Mid/senior-level admissions staff must meet regularly with their key points of contact at each agency, receive updates and monitor mutually agreed upon goals frequently. Your university must be prepared to use additional resources such as yield trips, paid agent visits to campus to learn your differentiated student experience, and specific marketing strategies to support the recruitment success of the agents.\nThere is considerable evidence that well-maintained agency relationships can be an important part of the overarching international student enrolment management strategy alongside direct institutional recruitment and effective educational consultancy. However, agents must not be simply left alone to fulfil headcount goals without a clear understanding of accountability and an intentional and constant oversight by appropriate university administrators. Failure to do so risks leaving the university exposed, as described in the recent PIE article, and ultimately reflects poorly on the university planning and practice.\nRoger Brindley\nView all articles by Roger\n0\nComments\nAdd Your Opinion\nShow Response\nNo comments found.\nLeave Your Comment\nYour email address will not be published.

However, with the rising cost of UK education and the depreciation of the Malaysian ringgit, the dynamics of this long-established market are changing.\nEducation as investment: considering the ‘long-term value’ of a UK degree\n“The way students make decisions has definitely evolved,” says Phil Pedro, assistant headteacher, head of sixth form at Epsom College in Malaysia. “There’s a lot more thought going into things like long-term value. It’s no longer just about getting into a well-known university, but about whether the experience and outcomes justify the cost.”\nParents are also becoming more involved in the decision-making process. They are asking more detailed questions and are heavily weighing post-graduation employability into their future planning. Courses with practical components, such as internships or work placements, factor into their decisions, often augmenting their perceptions of value.\nPedro notes: “The conversations we’re having now go far beyond rankings – they’re about finding the right fit, balancing cost with opportunity, and thinking carefully about the path ahead.”\nThe conversations are about finding the right fit, balancing cost with opportunity, and thinking carefully about the path ahead\nStudents are casting their nets more widely than ever before\nWhile the first-year-entry route has been typical for many Malaysian students going to the UK in the past, students are now considering alternative pathways.\n“In recent years, we have seen growing interest in transnational education options such as twinning programmes, credit transfer pathways, and branch campuses as a more affordable and flexible route to obtaining a UK degree with less money being spent,” observes Eswary Govindasamy, senior executive – university placement at Sunway University.\nSome are postponing their plans to study in the UK, opting instead to stay in Malaysia for their undergraduate degree and then going abroad for their postgraduate studies. The one-year duration of most postgraduate-taught courses is perceived to be more financially viable, with the added benefit of graduating with a higher qualification.\nAdditionally, as other Anglophone destinations such as the US, Canada and Australia become increasingly expensive – in step with the UK – Malaysian students and parents are exploring a wider range of non-traditional destinations.\nEast Asian countries, such as Japan, South Korea, and Hong Kong, have emerged as attractive options due to their cultural similarities and the generous scholarships available.\nHarri Suominen, chief innovation officer and co-founder of Edunation, a pathway provider to European universities, has observed this trend firsthand. “There’s been a noticeable shift from the traditional ‘big four’ English-speaking countries to a broader ‘big 10’ that includes European nations such as Germany, France, the Netherlands, and Finland.”\n“This transition is driven by factors like certain restrictions in the big four countries, and on the other hand, affordable tuition, high-quality education and living standards, and favourable work opportunities in Europe.”\nStudents and parents are proactively looking for supplementary scholarships\nEmma Davidson, director of the sixth form at Kolej Tuanku Ja’afar, says: “A lot of students and their parents have been sensible and put a pot of money aside for their university education. Now, it seems as though the pot is just not quite enough for some courses, universities, and cities. These students need top-up scholarships, not necessarily full scholarships, because parents and students have done their bit [but need a bit more help to get there].”\n“In the past, a university-awarded scholarship was often a nice thing to have. Now it seems to make or break a student’s decision. The universities that have good funding are attracting more attention.”\nAffinity for the UK remains\nAll that said, Malaysians are not completely ruling the UK out. Internal data from MABECS indicates that the number of UK applications post-Covid-19 has, in fact, increased year on year.\nPedro notes: “The UK still holds strong appeal – especially for courses like medicine, law, or economics.”\nMany students remain keen on the UK due to its strong academic reputation and globally recognised qualifications. However, prestige and familiarity are no longer enough to capture the exclusive attention of students who must now make financially strategic decisions for their futures.\nTo stay competitive in the market, UK universities must re-evaluate their overall value proposition and find ways to communicate it effectively to students and parents who have become particularly discerning ‘customers’ in their decision-making.\nThe Malaysian student market is rapidly evolving, and UK universities must be ready to evolve alongside it – or risk getting left behind.\nAbout the author: Cassandra Chia is a writer, editor, and marketing & events executive at MABECS, Malaysia’s most experienced education agency for UK university placements.

So what is the current visa refusal rate and should institutions start to worry?\nby Beth Kennedy\nJune 10 2025\n5 Min Read\nShare\nCopied!\n0\nAdd Your Opinion\nComments from the new home secretary have spooked international education stakeholders. Photo: iStock\nThe UK government’s recent immigration white paper laid out a number of changes for UK institutions, including changes to compliance metrics.\n⁠It proposes to raise the minimum pass requirement of each Basic Compliance Assessment (BCA) metric – which all institutions must meet – by five percentage points. Under the plans, a sponsor would have to maintain a course enrolment rate of at least 95% and a course completion rate of 90% in order to pass the compliance threshold.\nA traffic-light system of green, amber, and red will be created to publicly identify which universities are in breach of their sponsor licence – with red signalling a major breach.\nOf all the mooted changes laid out in the white paper, this is the one that is making UK stakeholders the most uneasy. After all, no one wants see their university get a dreaded ‘red’ rating.\nThis sense of trepidation is largely down to to the myriad factors beyond institutions’ control that affect whether prospective students’ visas are accepted – with all the knock-on effects on their compliance rating that this entails.\nWhile institutions do vet international applicants before they are accepted onto programs, their visa could nevertheless be rejected due to documentation errors, Home Office decisions or – rarely – decisions at the UK border.\nSo is the sector right to be worried? While there is no publicly available information on the average refusal rate for each higher education institution in the UK, the latest available Home Office figures show that the vast majority of study visa applications are accepted – with a refusal rate of roughly 4% in 2024 and 2023.\nOK, so it’s a bit tight – but that would mean most insitutions would be within the 5% threshold, right?\nWell, not exactly. It may look as though, even if nothing changes, most institutions would be (just) within the 5% refusal threshold, but that’s not quite how it works.\nWhile the average refusal rate gives a view of the sector overall, it doesn’t show how the rate differs across institutions, nor the reasons why. For example, some institutions may have an almost non-existent visa rate for any number of reasons – such as recruiting only a small number of international students, or accepting applications mainly from countries with high rates of visa acceptance.\nConversely, having a higher refusal rate doesn’t necessarily mean that institutions are recruiting recklessly, and could instead show that they are offering places to students from countries with traditionally high visa refusal rates.\nThe refusal rate also differs depending on the time of year the visa application is made – with the smaller number of prospective students applying in Q1 much more likely to be refused than the majority of people who apply in the third quarter of the year.\nTell me more…\nIn the first quarter of 2025, there was a 12% refusal rate. While this may seem high, rates for the first quarter of the year are generally higher, with a 12% visa refusal rate for the same period in 2024, according to data from ApplyBoard.\nRefusal rates are also staying the same, despite an uptick in applications. Per ApplyBoard data, the number of UK visas issued in the first quarter of 2025 was 48,000 – up 27% year-on-year. But, crucially, the grant rate was 88% in both periods, showing an increased demand for student visas rather than any change to acceptance rates.\nQ1… sees fewer applications, often from countries with historically higher refusal rates, while Q3 aligns with the main academic intake, where documentation tends to be stronger\nSaskia Johnston, Sable International\nThe majority of student visa applications are made in the third quarter of each year, with this cohort generally having a very low refusal rate.\nAccording to Saskia Johnston, client services director at Sable International – a London-based immigration consultancy – the discrepancies marked “both seasonal trends and systemic pressures”.\n“Q1, covering January to March, sees fewer applications, often from countries with historically higher refusal rates, while Q3 aligns with the main academic intake, where documentation tends to be stronger and UKVI operates at full capacity,” she told The PIE News.\nJohnston added that visa refusal rates are driven by a number of interconnected factors, such as challenges verifying financial documents from some places, and economic instability in source countries, as well as tighter immigration rules brought in over recent years.\n“These shifts are reshaping international student mobility to the UK,” she said.\nBut how does the visa refusal rate change according to nationality?\nAn ApplyBoard analysis comparing data between Q1 2024 and the same period in 2025  gives a fascinating insight into changing study visa refusal rates by nationality. While some key markets, such as India, Nigeria and Ghana, are seeing year-on-year increases in grant rates, whereas other countries such as Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh are all seeing issuance rates fall.\nKey takeaways for Q1 2025 include:\nIndia saw a 96% grant rate (up five percentage points year on year).\nNigeria also saw a 96% grant rate (up seven percentage points year on year).\nSri Lanka saw its grant rate rise to 91% (up 16 percentage points year on year).\nGhana saw an 88% grant rate (up 12 percentage points year on year).\nPakistan, meanwhile, saw its grant rate drop to to 74% (down eight percentage points year on year).\nNepal saw its grant rate fall to 84% (down 14 percentage points year on year).\nBangladesh saw its grant drop to 63% (down 15 percentage points year on year).\nBeth Kennedy\nBeth Kennedy is a journalist and editor with 10 years experience in specialist media.

Photo: The PIE\nNepal has long been synonymous with the legendary ‘Sherpa’ mountain guides, skilled in helping international travellers explore the Himalayas.\nThere is also however, a more recent tradition of local education guides helping their compatriots to seek out adventure and opportunity through study abroad.\nIn the past, this demand favoured Australia as a study destination, but since the Albanese government introduced increased visa restrictions, that demand has increasingly turned to alternative destinations like the US, France, Japan and the UK.\nAccording to ONS data, more than 9,000 study visas were issued to Nepalese students studying in the UK as of March 2024 but the true number is undoubtedly higher in the year since.\nThe PIE News visited Franklin International, a leading local agent, to better understand the factors supporting growth.\nAway from the chaotic streets of Kathmandu, where thousands of agent offices operate within a square mile in a district known as ‘Putalisadak’, Franklin International has chosen instead to base its national headquarters in the foothills of peaceful Pokhara.\nHere we find an operation that feels more like a family than an agency. There aren’t any cut-outs of Big Ben; instead, they favour a comfortable working atmosphere for staff and students.\nThere is an office full of people diligently running document checks, taking calls, and running webinars with their prospective students across Nepal.\nI meet a team packing for a 17-day tour of the country to meet applicants face-to-face – giving them a chance to outline important next steps and reassure family members.\nThere are entire rooms of people dedicated to supporting universities like the University of Roehampton and the University of East London, for whom they facilitate close operational relationships that deliver hundreds of compliant student enrolments.\n“The UK demand is still in its infancy,” company CMO and co-founder, Deepak Khadka tells me.\n“The number of students applying has grown rapidly, but the knowledge about the UK process is limited among most people,” he continues.”There are too many agents looking for short-cut commission – so we have had to build a system in partnership with British universities to focus on the compliance checks they need.”\nThis is a price-sensitive market, with only 15-20 universities offering financially viable course options. This has created a unique bubble where large numbers of students are following each other to the same university in each intake. Word of mouth is a key driver of demand.\nThis volume has, in turn, triggered an explosion in Nepalese agent activity as the potential for high commission levels is clear.\nAt a higher education event in Kathmandu, The PIE met teams of young friends, often still in their 20s or early 30s, keen to get involved and cash-in on prospective students from their neighbourhoods.\n“We have a choice to make in Nepal,” explains Khadka. “We either compete as agents, or we try and work together to best support the students.”\nHaving completed his doctorate in agent supply chains from UWS, his understanding of the Nepalese market is crucial.\n“We try to act as supportive guides for these other guys. They have so much energy and ambition – but we must make sure the professional compliance is water-tight when processing applications,” he tells The PIE. “We have the expertise to do this correctly. We call this the Official University Representative network to convey that message.”\nKhadka is keen to stress that he and his fellow agents care far more about the students they work with than pitting themselves against one another.\n“I care about Nepal’s future. We don’t want to make the same mistakes as other countries or regions,” he says.\n“We want our young people to succeed in their study abroad adventures – and I would rather work together for a better system, than get drawn into a territorial battle. We are proud that this model is being recognised by our UK partners and local officials here.”\nOverseas education agencies must have government approval to operate in Nepal, leading to conflict over online aggregator models trying to undercut this licensing.\nI care about Nepal’s future. We don’t want to make the same mistakes as other countries or regions\nDeepak Khadka, Franklin International\nLocal protocol can be complicated as students need to obtain a ‘No Obligation Certificate’ from the government to study abroad, and many turn to government-backed student finance options to prepare their budgets.\nVidhi Mistry, executive director for partner relations and growth for the University of Roehampton, explains her approach to the market: “In Nepal, when there are thousands of agents, it’s not about being everywhere. A university doesn’t need to work with every agent.\n“A right partnership is about aligning values, intent and quality that prioritises reputation and longevity. Agents can elevate the sector or dilute it. Exclusivity when earned and aligned isn’t a restriction, it is a strategy for sustainable growth [in a chaotic market].”\nThe PIE spoke to Sajan, a Nepalese student who has an offer to study at the University of West Scotland London campus. He explained his reasoning for working with an agency.\n“I have friends already at UWS London and they love it. I didn’t need help with choosing which university or course I wanted, but I had to make sure my finances and visa are processed correctly,” he says. “My father and I have been guided to understand my required budget and each step of the process. I am very grateful.”\nWith the UK government announcing future plans to tighten visa issuance for countries linked to asylum claims, and to clamp down on universities linked to poor compliance metrics – it is important the Nepal market doesn’t grow too fast, too soon.\nStrong demand will undoubtedly bring greater competition, so only time will tell if universities and agents can get regulate themselves to realise the opportunity.\nNicholas Cuthbert\nNick began his career with Nottingham Trent University in the UK working in international student recruitment, before going on to a wide range of leadership and consultancy roles in the private sector.

One of his ventures, Ascent One, is a powerful agent management platform – a comprehensive ecosystem for the education industry, enabling institutions to efficiently manage agent networks, admissions, and marketing through a single unified portal.\nMeanwhile, BPO Intelligence specialises in the global warehousing and distribution of educational promotional materials, helping institutions reach audiences worldwide.\nHe was fifteen when he started his first venture – selling candles during the Diwali festival in his hometown of Chandigarh, India during Diwali.\nGulati would try his hand at several business ventures over the next few years. But while some were financially successful, he found them unsatisfying.\nLooking for direction, he approached his uncle, who was working at Pfizer at the time. “He said to me, ‘Look, I can get you a job, but you need to learn computers,’” Gulati recalls. Computers were just beginning to enter everyday life in India, and he saw an opportunity to upskill.\nHe enrolled in a computer course – and despite being the least qualified person in the room, surrounded by professionals with years of experience, he excelled. “It was the unused brain put to use,” he says.\nInspired by this success, he started a computer training centre of his own. It proved to be successful, but Gulati wasn’t done yet. He had his eyes set on Australia.\nWith financial support from his father, who borrowed money to help him go abroad, Gulati travelled to Melbourne to study towards a graduate diploma in applied information systems at RMIT University.\nDuring his studies, he worked long hours in Indian restaurants – dishwashing, waiting tables – and took on a series of other odd jobs, including door-knocking for a roofing company. “I had to book free roof inspection bookings and I failed to make even a single booking,” he remembers.. “The guy wanted to pay me. I said, I can’t take the money. I haven’t delivered anything and I don’t think I can do justice to you paying me.”\nAfter completing his degree, Gulati quickly secured a job in IT. But he soon realised that many international students weren’t as fortunate. Misled by agents about the opportunities awaiting them after graduation, they faced a far more uncertain reality.\nGulati returned to India with a clear purpose: to build the kind of support system these students should have had. He founded his own education agency, Oceanic Consultants – an operation that rapidly scaled. But Gulati, never one to settle, was already thinking ahead.\nHe noticed a growing challenge in the international education sector: the delivery and distribution of promotional materials. Spotting a gap, Gulati launched BPO Intelligence – with an initial investment of just AUD $800.\n“We delivered year-on-year value to our clients,” he recalls. “From one client it became three. Three became five. And then today we have almost every university in Australia and the largest private colleges as well in New Zealand.”\nFrom one client it became three. Three became five. And then today we have almost every university in Australia and the largest private colleges as well in New Zealand\nNaresh Gulati\nThat footprint has since expanded to the UK and North America, establishing BPO Intelligence as a global player in the space.\nGulati’s instinct for spotting problems and crafting practical solutions would become the driving force behind his next venture.\nWhile working closely with education providers, he had identified another persistent pain point – software overload. “For every problem, universities kept buying another software, another software, another software,” he explains. “While that solves one problem, in my view, that has actually multiplied the problems for the providers.”\nEvery new system required separate logins, data entries, and workflows – adding complexity rather than reducing it. “Now every time they update into one place, they have to update every software. That is humanly not possible,” he says.\nThis insight led to the creation of what is now known as Ascent One – a unified ecosystem launched in 2024, designed to streamline how institutions manage agent networks, admissions, marketing, and more. Rather than fragmenting operations across multiple platforms, Ascent One centralises it all into one cohesive hub.\n“We came with end to end solution there. Another problem I saw in the industry was people had to buy the full system. I don’t think that’s a fair way to do business.”\nThat’s why it was important for Gulati ensure Ascent One is a fully integrated, modular ecosystem. Clients can start with just a few modules and add more as needed. Each module communicates with the others, both from the start and as new ones are added, ensuring continuous data exchange internally and with external systems, without the need for manual intervention.\nFor universities working with hundreds of agencies – each potentially operating across multiple locations – keeping agent information accurate and up to date can be a challenge. Offices open, close, staff move, and maintaining those records can quickly become unmanageable.\nAgents face a similar problem. By bringing both institutions and agents into the same digital ecosystem, Gulati explains how he seeks to simply this process with his product. Updates made by agents are automatically reflected across all connected providers, significantly reducing administrative overhead and helping maintain data consistency across the board.\nAnd while similar products exist, Gulati says he welcomes the competition, viewing it as motivation to keep refining his offering for the international education community.\nKim Martin\nKim is a journalist specialising in international education, with a keen focus on policy, immigration, and global student recruitment.

Abroad\nFulbright board resigns, citing Trump’s political interference\nNearly all board members of the Fulbright Scholarship Program have announced their resignation, accusing Trump of usurping the board’s authority and politicising the country’s flagship cultural exchange program.\nby Polly Nash\nJune 12 2025\n3 Min Read\nShare\nCopied!\n0\nAdd Your Opinion\nThe board members, appointed by the Biden administration, voted \"overwhelmingly\" to resign, rather than endorse the \"unprecedented actions\" of the current US government.\nIn a statement on June 12, board members said the administration had “usurped” its authority and denied Fulbright awards to a “substantial number of individuals” chosen by the board under its congressionally mandated powers.\nIt said members had “overwhelmingly” voted to quit the board, with their resignation effective immediately.\nThe members accused the administration of “subjecting an additional 1,200 foreign Fulbright recipients to an unauthorized review process” that could lead to more applicants being rejected.\n“Through generations of war and peace, the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Program has been a bipartisan pillar of American diplomacy,” said members, highlighting the “exhaustive” year-long process of granting scholarships, which they say has been overridden by State Department officials.\nFor its part, the state department has called the 12 board members “partisan political appointees of the Biden administration,” claiming their resignation is a “political stunt” attempting to undermine the Trump administration.\n“It’s ridiculous to believe that these members would continue to have final say over the application process, especially when it comes to determining academic suitability and alignment with President Trump’s Executive Orders,” a senior state department official told The PIE News.\nStudy abroad colleagues and former Fulbright scholars have taken to social media, expressing support for the board members and highlighting the huge soft power benefits of “one of the most respected international exchange programs in the world”.\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, the Fulbright membership page on the state department website listed only one name: Carmen Estrada-Schaye, who was appointed to the board in 2022.\n“I was appointed by the president of the United States and I intend to fill out my term,” Estrada-Schaye told The Associated Press.\nTo continue to serve … would risk legitimising actions we believe are unlawful and damage America’s credibility abroad\nFulbright Scholarship board members\n“We are frankly stunned that the distinguished Fulbright board was backed into a corner by the Trump Administration and saw no alternative but to resign,” AIFS chairman Bill Gertz told The PIE News.\n“Fulbright enjoys bipartisan support in Congress,” said Gertz, adding that he expected this, and all cultural exchanges, to be fully funded in 2026 and beyond.\nThe news comes as the sector is bracing for the president’s FY 2026 “skinny” budget, with Trump currently proposing cutting international exchanges by 93%, though these plans are yet to be approved by Congress.\nFounded in 1946, each year the Fulbright Program provides approximately 8,000 merit-based grants to students, scholars and professionals pursuing graduate studies, conducting research, or teaching English abroad.\nGrants are awarded to US students and international students from 160 countries, with the scholarship considered a key pillar of American public diplomacy and soft power.\n“Our resignation is not a decision we take lightly,” wrote members: “But to continue to serve after the Administration has consistently ignored the board’s request that they follow the law would risk legitimising actions we believe are unlawful and damage the integrity of this storied program and America’s credibility abroad.”\nAs highlighted by the board members, Fulbright alumni have gone on to become leaders of government, industry, academia, arts and culture “in every part of the world”.\nSixty-two Fulbright alumni have been awarded the Nobel Prize, while 44 Fulbright recipients have served as heads of state or government, according to the State Department.\nWhile the program is sponsored by the State Department, over 35 foreign governments match or exceed the US government’s annual contributions.\nBoard member Ambassador James Costos said he voted to resign the board “not in protest, but in defence of principle”.\nIn a statement on June 11, Costos highlighted Fulbright’s “extraordinary role in advancing international education and cultural diplomacy,” forming bonds that “serve as the strongest defence against global conflict”.\n“That is the essence of soft power. That is the Fulbright legacy,” wrote Costos, maintaining that he believed in that legacy too deeply to stand by “as it is compromised”.\nPolly Nash\nPolly graduated with a degree in History and English Literature from the University of Edinburgh during which she did a year abroad in sunny Santa Barbara.

The groups say that with every day that passes, it becomes “increasingly difficult” for international students and scholars to arrive on US campuses before the start of the fall semester.\n“If you believe in the power and promise of international education, this is the moment to speak out. Our students – future scientists, artists, entrepreneurs, and changemakers – are waiting,” wrote NAFSA chief executive Fanta Aw in a LinkedIn post.\nIf you believe in the power and promise of international education, this is the moment to speak out\nFanta Aw, NAFSA\n“This suspension comes at a peak time when at least 50% of new international students still need to schedule visa interview appointments in order to arrive in time for the fall semester,” she added.\nNAFSA and the US for Coalition are therefore urging stakeholders to sign their name in order to convey to Congress that the suspension “jeopardises the contributions international students and scholars make to every corner of the US and that visa appointments should resume immediately”.\nThe advocacy group also asks individuals to customise their message with specific examples of how this visa suspension is having a direct impact on their communities.\nDuring a webinar on June 11, leading voices in international education spoke of the “tremendous damage” being done to the industry, as the ramping up of hostile government policies take hold on student interest.\nAs well as the administration’s ongoing suspension of visa interviews, its attacks on Harvard and a travel ban on 12 countries have caused international student interest to fall to its lowest level since mid-pandemic.\nKim Martin\nKim is a journalist specialising in international education, with a keen focus on policy, immigration, and global student recruitment.

Photo: iStock.\nDuring a webinar on June 11, sector leaders acknowledged the “tremendous damage” being inflicted on international education in the US, as the ramping up of harmful government policies take hold on student interest.\nIn particular, the administration’s ongoing suspension of visa interviews, its attacks on Harvard and its travel ban on 12 countries have caused international student interest to fall to its lowest level since mid-pandemic.\nNew data shared by Keystone Education Group highlighted year-on-year interest falling by 55% and 52% respectively in April and May 2025, coinciding with Trump’s tariff announcements, the start of his ongoing feud with Harvard and widespread visa revocations, to name a few harmful policies.\nCommenting on the near real-time data shared during the ICEF webinar, NAFSA CEO Fanta Aw acknowledged the “tremendous damage” done to the sector in recent months, adding: “There’s no need to sugarcoat it. That’s a reality.”\n“How students feel matters tremendously – when people feel uncertainty, it matters, and it has implications for human behaviour,” said Aw, pointing to the current visa interview suspension and its implications for students and US institutions.\nHighlighting this, attendees heard that Middle Eastern offer holders felt “unwelcome, uncertain, and unsafe” in the US, with 60% considering other study options, according to Saqr Alkharabsheh, who works as a student recruitment manager in Jordan at Oval Office Group, an education service provider that operates in the Middle East and New Zealand.\nCritically, the visa interview freeze – now in place for 16 days – has blocked more than half of international students due to enrol in the US in September from booking a visa interview, according to Studyportals estimates.\nThe impact of the freeze, coupled with the wider policy landscape, is so that if things don’t change, “the damage to the sector could be worse than the impact of the pandemic,” warned Studyportals CEO Edwin van Rest.\nWhile IDP data collected before May 22nd showed 83% of students still viewing the US favourably, much has changed in the past month.\nWhat’s more, 87% of students in the same IDP survey said they were worried about potential changes to visa and post-graduation work rights, highlighting significant concerns about current policies.\nIn the short-term, visa frustrations have made 35% of students likely to defer their study plans in the US, with 30% saying that they were likely to cancel them altogether, according to Keystone, adding that students were pivoting towards the UK, Europe and Asia.\nAnd yet, amid shifting global mobility and efforts of some global destinations to attract US researchers and protect academic freedom, Aw emphasised: “This is not a zero-sum game. There are no winners and losers.”\n“What the US has invested in research, other countries will not be able to catch up in the next five to ten years,” said Aw, highlighting the losses to global research that will impact everybody.\nWebinar panellists raised additional concerns about declining interest among “mid funnel students” – those who are one or two years out from beginning their studies – 44% of whom are considering other destinations, as per IDP data.\nThis is not a zero-sum game. There are no winners and losers.\nFanta Aw, NAFSA\nAs for risk mitigation, universities should consider online learning and TNE, advised leaders, noting a rising interest in alternative options that allow students to begin their studies online or elsewhere, with the view of moving onto campus in the future.\nAnd while institutions devise recruitment strategies, they were reminded that international students are “not a monolith,” with those from India, Nigeria and Nepal generally maintaining a stronger view of the US than Chinese students indicating lower favourability.\nWhile no actions have been taken to advance the policy, Marco Rubio’s alarming announcement to “aggressively revoke” Chinese student visas has fuelled fear and uncertainty among the 277,000 Chinese students in the US, as well as prospective students.\n“The last three weeks have been dramatic and lots of Chinese students are deciding not to begin their studies in the US this summer,” said Hanks Jun Han, vice president of global business development at Bright Can-Achieve education agency in Beijing.\n“Chinese students apply to multiple countries and often have multiple offers in hand, so lots of them are already shifting to other countries after the visa pause,” added Jun Han, citing safety concerns as a major factor influencing student decisions.\nWhen it comes to field of study, declining interest from international students is hitting sustainability disciplines most acutely, followed by STEM and healthcare, with over half of international students in the US taking STEM subjects.\nAs highlighted by van Rest, 74% of electrical engineering students in the US are international, which begs the question of how such a vital industry would survive without international education.\nIt is for this reason – the $44 bn economic impact of international students as well as their “much, much, much larger” overall contribution – that van Rest is hopeful the “tables will turn,” echoing his fellow panellists in emphasising the resilience and entrepreneurial spirit of the sector.\nPolly Nash\nPolly graduated with a degree in History and English Literature from the University of Edinburgh during which she did a year abroad in sunny Santa Barbara.

Photo: The PIE\nAny incumbent government in the UK would seek to reduce net migration figures, according to political commentator and The Rest is Politics podcast star Rory Stewart.\nSpeaking to an industry audience at DETcon, he answered audience questions on geo-politics, university funding and net migration trends.\n“One of the things that’s happened in the world is that politics is no longer domestic, and this push against immigration is nothing unique to the United Kingdom,” said Stewart, when asked to clarify his opinion on a one-way trend.\n“It defines the politics of the United States, Germany, France, Netherlands, etc. and any political party that tries to pretend it isn’t an issue or tries to think it can somehow explain its way out of it would be doomed,” he warned.\nIt was suggested to him that the immigrants the British public is concerned about are the illegal immigrants or asylum seekers, rather than international students who contribute economically.\nAny political party that tries to pretend [immigration] isn’t an issue or tries to think it can somehow explain its way out of it would be doomed\nRory Stewart, political commentator\nThat may be the case, said Stewart, but he suggested the electorate would still favour tight controls, with public opinion “so clear” on this issue.\n“It’s true, of course, that if you ask anybody, including many Reform [right-wing political party] voters, they can think of many, many things that they like about individual immigrants and they can see their contribution to the country,” he responded.\n“But I’m afraid it would be a real mistake to conclude from that conversation that that individual would support 725,000 people a year coming into the UK.”\nThe well-known podcast host suggested voters might support “a position that there were more students and less family reunity, or more students and fewer asylum seekers, but they would still want the overall numbers down”.\nStewart also discussed the impact of the legal dispute between the US government and Harvard and the crisis in higher education in the country.\nWhat is happening right now with federal funding restrictions and visa bans is “the most incredible act of self-harm.. I mean, astonishing”, he shared, explaining that the strong funding infrastructure into US universities (he teaches at Yale) is key to research outputs that translate into economic and competitive advantage.\n“Why is the US economy still a quarter of the global economy? Why has the US economy gone from being the same size as Europe to being 50% larger in just a decade? Why is the US, for all its flaws, the home to the most productive, competitive, innovative companies in the world?,” he asked\n“The answer is a partnership between the federal government and the universities. It goes all the way back to the Second World War, a deliberate decision after the Second Wold War for the federal government to set up these incredible research grants, which were fed into these universities and which have pioneered everything from the most basic science to ultimately at the other end, their realisation into commercial activity.”\nStewart cited the internet, GPS and nuclear power as inventions born out of a partnership between the American state and American academics. “And Trump is dismantling that,” he warned.\nAnd he warned that the UK education scene should not believe it is immune from the culture wars. “American culture is very powerful. And what happens in the United States moves more easily than we want to acknowledge”.\nWhen asked what “Rory as PM” would do (he was once a Conservative MP) to shore up financial instability among UK universities, he again pointed to a need for increased government funding.\n“I’m afraid the answer is kind of obvious and difficult – the only answer to this conundrum is proper central government funding of universities,” he said. “The sector is too underfunded, and so many of the problems that follow come from that fact.”\nAmy Baker\nAmy Baker is CEO and co-founder of The PIE and worked as a journalist for many years covering the international education sector.

Photo: The PIE\nAdditional reporting by Nicholas Cuthbert\nImmigration white paper brings compliance conversations to the fore as Tony Blair’s Home Secretary questions rapid rise in international students at mid-ranking institutions.\nSector hits back at comments, pointing out that consequences of compliance breaches not worth it for institutions.\nConcerns also raised about asylum claims, as reports suggest some students are using route to extend stay in UK.\nJack Straw, who served as Home Secretary between 1997 and 2001, pointed to parts of the recently released immigration white paper that showed universities ranked between 600 and 1,200 by the Times Higher Education had “expanded dramatically” in terms of their international intake.\n“There has to be a question there about the fact that some universities in that category have been chasing students and not paying attention to rigorous controls,” he told delegates at Duolingo English Test’s inaugural DETcon London yesterday. “And if you do that, the rest of the sector will pay the price.”\n“You may be complaining about that, but that’s just where it is,” he added.\nHe highlighted the raft of stricter controls on international students highlighted in the white paper – which include more stringent English language requirements and higher thresholds for the Basic Compliance Assessment (BCA) – saying that he was “in no doubt” these would come into force in time.\nWhile the effect of these tighter regulations could “squeeze… some universities”, some of their business models up until this point had not been sustainable, he said. Straw went so far as to tell The PIE News that it was inevitable some universities would go bust.\nStraw’s comments drew ire from delegates at the conference – some of whom dismissed the claims as “rubbish”, while others were at pains to point out the high compliance rate in the sector.\nYou may be complaining about that, but that’s just where it is\nJack Straw, former Home Secretary\nSpeaking in a panel discussion later on at the event, deputy vice-chancellor at the University of Portsmouth, Chris Chang, said the notion that only certain institutons should be able to recruit international students was “nonsense”.\n“Half of the international staff [at this conference] would not be here today. I wouldn’t be here today because I’m went to study at a post-92 institution,” he said. “At the end of the day, I think that’s rubbish. I will be brave enough to say that.”\nHe stressed that his university doesn’t “take sides”, instead offering choice and options for international students. And, he added, it is in institutions’ best interests to pay heed to immigration controls.\n“We need to protect our sponsorship license – and that’s right, we need to take immigration policy seriously, that’s our duty. But we still offer choice and different people have different drivers,” he said.\nAnne Marie Graham, UKCISA chief executive, defended the UK’s higher education sector as being “extremely compliant”.\n“That’s not to say it is 100% compliant – there will be issue that arise – but what we don’t hear in that public narrative is how the UKVI and institutions work collaboratively to identify trends and work to eradicate problems,” she told The PIE.\nShe continued: “It’s in no sponsors’ interest to be noncompliant, they would lose their licence if they were to do so.”\nMeanwhile, HEPI director Nick Hillman took aim at the Home Office’s attitude towards international education in the UK – shown in its emphasis upon compliance at universities in the immigration white paper. Speaking to The PIE, he paid particular mind to the squeezed BCA thresholds.\n“I think that it was quite a clever move of the government to put that crack down on compliance in the white paper because it is the sort of thing [mainstream] journalists overlook, but it is critically important and a good number of universities are very close to those new, reduced thresholds and they are going to have to look very carefully at their numbers,” he said.\nAnd he said the sector always faced an “existential crisis” in the rare cases when institutions were banned from recruiting international students.\n“There are a lot of different factors to do with compliance, some of which are in the control of the university, and some are to do with geopolitical factors. You suddenly find you’ve got far more applicants from one part of the world that you have traditionally recruited from,” he said. “These numbers can go up and down by more than people realise year to year and I think the Home Office are trying to pull a fast one in making it look much simpler than it feels to people on the ground.”\nSpeaking at DETCon London, Straw also took a hard line on reports of international students applying for asylum – which also formed a sizeable part of the immigration white paper as the government took swipes at those it claims are doing so disingenuously as a way to extend their time in the UK.\nThe white paper drew attention to an increasing number of asylum clams for students coming to the end of their course “even though nothing substantive has changed in their home country while they have been in the UK”. It pointed to figures showing that around 30% of asylum claims in the UK come from visa holders, with 47% of this number coming from students.\nWhile Straw pointed out that some of these claims would be genuine, he hit out at the practice as a whole, calling it “a racket… we should have no truck with”.\n“Everybody knows it’s a racket. And there are a lot of people, particularly immigration advisors and lawyers, who are making money out of this racket,” he stressed. “We should deal with it.”\nBeth Kennedy\nBeth Kennedy is a journalist and editor with 10 years experience in specialist media.

The program will also provide expert guidance and preparation for US university sports scholarship placements.\nThe IOF Academy, co-founded in 2007, has helped over 100 players sign with professional clubs and supported over 1,000 players in securing soccer scholarships at top universities in the US and beyond.\nRuss Hullett, IOF Academy co-founder as well as a former coach and scout for major clubs including Manchester United and Aston Villa, said: “We’re committed to delivering a professional academy-style experience for every player.\n“This program is about creating real opportunities, whether you’re dreaming of a career on the field or aiming to thrive in the global sports industry.”\nThis program is about creating real opportunities, whether you’re dreaming of a career on the field or aiming to thrive in the global sports industry\nRuss Hullett, IOF Academy\nMatthew Hird, chief international officer at Abbotsholme School said the partnership would allow the school to “offer elite football coaching alongside our first-class academic provision”.\n“It’s about inspiring young footballers on their journey into futures in sport,” he said.\nStudents enrolled in the program will join Abbotsholme either as day pupils or full boarders. As part of the experience, they will represent the newly established IOF Mavericks Football Club, which will be based on-site, and benefit from training in a professional, academy-style environment.\nThe school’s campus includes extensive sports facilities such as a full-size 3G pitch, FIFA-standard natural grass pitches, and a high-performance strength and conditioning centre. Combined with Abbotsholme’s experienced EAL support and strong home-away-from-home care, the school aims to offer a comprehensive environment where student-athletes can thrive both academically and athletically.\nFrieda Zhou\nFrieda is a linguistics postgraduate from SOAS, University of London, with an undergraduate degree from the University of Edinburgh.

Photo: Pexels\nThe UK’s national international education strategy was produced by the Department for Business and Trade, in partnership with the Department for Education in 2019, and is now set for a refresh.\nThe current strategy has faced criticism for being too focused on export targets, and the strategy is now due to be re-written in response to the Labour government policy papers on immigration, trade and industry.\nSpeaking at the International Higher Education Forum, Sir Steve Smith, the UK’s international education champion revealed that the new IES is being co-authored by the FCDO as new stakeholders, in a bid to improve policy cohesion across departments.\n“As you know, we’re currently reviewing the international education strategy to ensure that it represents the evolution of international education in the last five years and to align it with the state of the priority,” Smith told stakeholders at the IHEF event.\n“We’ve been exploring the structure of governance and strategic direction of the strategy and we’re working to ensure we align with other government policies on key areas such as sustainable international student recruitment and TNE.\n“Now the FCDO have been brought on board as a joint owner of the international education strategy. This is a really significant development and offers an exciting opportunity for us to leverage the soft power benefits of international education, as well for fully utilised the UK government’s network overseas.”\nSoft power is seen as one of the UK’s most enduring and valuable assets, with 58 current and recent world leaders educated through the British system.\nThe FCDO is the UK government’s department supporting foreign policy, development work, and consular services overseas, including grant-in-aid funding for the British Council.\nHowever recent reports in The Guardian have suggested that the British Council ‘may have to close in 60 countries’ amid cuts to aid budget in the government’s spending review.\nCatriona Laing, SRO for the Soft Power Hub as part of the FCDO, spoke about the central importance of excellent universities to UK soft power.\n“The UK still ranks number three in the world for soft power impact, behind the US and China, but watch this space,” she said.\n“Education is one of the dimensions we measure in soft power and the UK is globally recognised for the quality of its education system. By attracting students to the UK, we build global relationships, we promote our values and culture and we encourage people to advocate for us.”\nLaing explained that the government will be publishing both a trade strategy and an industrial strategy, both released after the spending review.\n“It is important to note that education, as we’ve heard, is absolutely central to our industrial strategy,” she said.\nThe new international education strategy is due for publication in the coming months.\nNicholas Cuthbert\nNick began his career with Nottingham Trent University in the UK working in international student recruitment, before going on to a wide range of leadership and consultancy roles in the private sector.

Photo: Unsplash\nTerritories and countries like South Korea and Hong Kong, part of the so-called “Asian Tigers” alongside Singapore and Taiwan, now view international students and intra-East Asian mobility as critical to sustaining economic growth in the region.\n“We have a very different economic situation compared to the UK or Canada. We don’t have an employment problem – in fact, we need more people and more talent across the board,” said James Tang, secretary-general, University Grants Committee, Hong Kong SAR, during a session at the International Higher Education Forum 2025, held last week at the University of Birmingham.\n“Our path to economic growth must shift – driven more by innovation and technology,” he added.\nA broader immigration crackdown in recent years across major study destinations, including the UK, US, Canada, and Australia, has had significant repercussions for international students.\nThe US, under Trump, has imposed study visa interview freezes, increased social media vetting, and revoked visas over personal views and nationality.\nCanada continues to enforce tightened restrictions on temporary residents, while Australia and the UK have proposed policy measures to make it more difficult for international students to enter and remain in their countries.\nThese changes, combined with more affordable options closer to home, relaxed residency requirements, lower tuition fees, and world-renowned universities, are now prompting the traditionally West-bound cohort from East Asia to look inward for higher education opportunities.\nAccording to a British Council report, student mobility within East Asia grew more rapidly between 2013 and 2020 than mobility from the region to major English-speaking destination countries.\nWe’re now focusing on parts of the world which were previously inconceivable to us as potential student markets\nJames Tang, UGC, Hong Kong\nWhile over 140,000 students from East Asia studied in China in 2018, its special administrative region, Hong Kong, is advancing its “Study in Hong Kong” brand, positioning the territory as an emerging international hub for post-secondary education.\nData obtained by The PIE News from the UGC for 2022/23 revealed that Hong Kong’s eight publicly funded universities hosted a total of 20,712 non-local students, with mainland Chinese students making up more than 78% of that cohort, accounting for 16,233 undergraduate and postgraduate enrolments.\nIn an effort to diversify that student body, Hong Kong is increasingly targeting students from India, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, and other countries.\n“With the right resources and support, we’re helping universities work together to reach out to potential markets. Our longer-term strategy is to promote broader awareness of Hong Kong’s institutions globally,” stated Tang.\n“One interesting development is the possibility of attracting more students from Afghanistan and Indonesia. We’re now focusing on parts of the world which were previously inconceivable to us as potential student markets.”\nAlthough Tang acknowledged the challenges of job creation and the shortage of affordable housing in Hong Kong, he emphasised the need to develop campuses that cater to international students.\n“To stay competitive as a small region with big internationalisation ambitions, we need to build campuses that are truly cosmopolitan and diverse.”\nSimilar to Hong Kong’s education branding efforts, South Korea has been advancing its “300K” project, which aims to boost the number of international students at its universities to 300,000 by 2027.\nAs of June 2024, the figure had reached 236,000, an increase of 29,000 from the previous year and a significant jump from around 170,000 recorded in 2022.\nWhile South Korea is only beginning to embrace the idea of welcoming more international students, there’s also a growing effort to highlight their value to the country’s ageing population, which now makes up a significant majority.\n“We need to highlight that internationalisation isn’t just about bringing in international students but it’s also about how these programs impact our domestic students, their education, and future employment,” explained Jun Hyun Hong, professor at the School of Public Service, Chung-Ang University, South Korea.\nSouth Korea’s push to attract more international students is driven by its need to counter a declining fertility rate and an ageing labour, but the effort is also challenged by nationalist sentiment and concerns over job competition.\n“If we want internationalisation to be meaningful, we have to take several key issues seriously and think differently about how we approach them,” stated Hong.\n“The government, universities, and industry must work together to ensure these efforts are not only successful but also sustainable in the long run.”\nAccording to Hong, regions like South Korea and Hong Kong don’t need to look to countries like the UK, US, or Canada for guidance on being a host country, instead, they should focus on leveraging their own strengths.\n“I don’t think Korea should try to become like the US or the UK. We need to follow our own model that fits our national context and values,” said Hong.\nMoreover, programs like Campus Asia, which promote trilateral academic collaboration between South Korea, China, and Japan, have now also been extended to ASEAN countries through the Korea-ASEAN AIMS (Asian International Mobility for Students) project.\n“What’s encouraging is that this program is now being extended to include ASEAN countries as well,” explained Hong.\n“If we want to be efficient and make real progress, we need to build on these kinds of exchange programs.”\nAs the US education sector undergoes significant changes, including cutbacks, funding reductions, and downsizing, stakeholders like Tang are looking to the UK to reinforce its already strong educational partnership with Hong Kong, seeing it as a relationship that could benefit East Asia.\nThis comes as the Trump administration moves to restrict Chinese student visas and limit US universities’ partnerships with Chinese institutions, citing “national security” concerns.\n“Of our 6,000 ongoing research projects, over half involve partners from Mainland China, with the rest largely coming from the US followed by the UK, Germany, and France,” stated Tang.\n“We currently have about 400 research collaborations with British universities, and there are still many opportunities to expand, both in research funding and student exchange.”\nAccording to Tang, the current headwinds facing Hong Kong universities’ partnerships with US institutions present an opportunity to deepen collaboration between Hong Kong and the UK.\n“As our own strategy evolves and global conditions change, there’s significant potential for us to step up our engagement with UK institutions,” he said.\nAbhishek Nair\nAbhishek Nair is a freelance journalist based out of Mumbai, with experience in covering sports and education across India.

Photo: Unsplash.\nLong regarded as a major source market, with an outbound student mobility ratio of 19%, Nepal is now eyeing an overhaul of its education system, which some have previously criticised for lacking a “forward-thinking policy”.\nWhile presenting the 2025/26 budget, Nepal’s deputy Prime Minister and finance minister, Bishnu Prasad Paudel, announced that international students will receive free visas covering the full length of their academic program, with their parents and guardians also being eligible for multiple-entry visas.\nThe move, according to Paudel, is part of a broader effort to improve the quality and management of higher education in Nepal under overarching legislation aimed at streamlining university operations, governance consistency, and academic structures across institutions.\nAlthough Nepal currently hosts a relatively small number of international students – primarily from neighbouring countries like Bangladesh, China, and India – stakeholders believe it has strong potential to expand its appeal through a range of specialised programs.\n“With growing international interest in subjects like medical studies, tourism, and Buddhism, the government wants to build Nepal’s image as an affordable, peaceful, and culturally rich place to study,” Surya Pokhrel, executive director of Educable Consultancy Nepal, told The PIE News.\nPrabha Thapa, international recruitment manager for ApplyBoard’s Nepal division, echoed this, noting that for students interested in Himalayan studies, Buddhism, climate science, or development, Nepal offers unmatched immersion.\n“From a practical standpoint, it’s relatively affordable, and many programs are taught in English, which helps a lot,” said Thapa.\n“Culturally, Nepal has a lot to offer: it’s a peaceful, naturally stunning country with a rich heritage and spiritual traditions that many students find compelling.”\nNepal could appeal to students from Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Africa – places where students are looking for affordable, quality education closer to home\nPrabha Thapa, ApplyBoard\nAlthough Nepal aims to curb student outflow, Pokhrel says this will be tough to achieve. Over 112,000 Nepali students went abroad in 2023/24 alone.\n“Every year, hundreds of thousands of Nepali students go abroad for higher education. The government realises that while this trend can’t be fully stopped due to globalization, Nepal can also become a study destination for others,” commented Pokhrel.\n“Nepal is also focusing on international partnerships, research, and student-friendly policies. Some universities already offer international-standard curricula, and English is widely used in higher education.”\nThough more Nepali students are going abroad for better education, including to India, Denmark, Finland, France, and the UAE beyond the big four study destinations, the trend is also driving significant remittance inflows once they enter the workforce.\nAccording to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, remittances from migrants accounted for up to 26.6% of Nepal’s GDP in 2023, amounting to an estimated $11 billion.\nAccording to Thapa, free study visas not only benefit students from lower-income countries and signal that Nepal is a welcoming destination, but also allow international students to contribute to Nepal’s economy, just as outbound Nepali students do through remittances.\n“Economically, international students can contribute significantly – not just through tuition but also through living expenses and broader engagement with local communities,” stated Thapa.\n“I think there’s strong potential to attract students from neighboring countries like Bangladesh, Bhutan, and parts of India. Beyond that, Nepal could appeal to students from Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Africa – places where students are looking for affordable, quality education closer to home.”\nBut Nepal’s ambitious plan to attract international students with free visas will not come without challenges.\nDespite a slight increase from the previous year, Nepal allocated 3.68% of its GDP to public education, still below the global average of 4.4%, despite facing challenges like outdated courses and limited university seats.\nWhile Nepal’s government is set to restructure university departments and faculties and strengthen higher education regulation by reorganising the current university commission, as per a report by the Kathmandu Post, there’s still work to be done.\n“While the policy is promising, there are challenges: many Nepali universities are not yet globally ranked or well-known; some courses and daily communication still involve Nepali, which can be hard for foreign students; visa and admission processes need to be clearer, faster, and more digital; and adjusting to food, lifestyle, and healthcare access can be difficult for some,” noted Pokhrel.\nAccording to Thapa, institutions and government authorities need to provide proper housing options, orientation programs, academic support, and pastoral care, among other services, if Nepal wants to attract more international students.\n“There’s also the issue of quality and consistency. If the experience varies wildly from one university to another, or if degrees aren’t globally recognized, it’ll be hard to build a lasting reputation. Plus, awareness is key – without a solid global outreach or marketing plan, the “free visa” message may not reach the students who would benefit most,” she added.\nAbhishek Nair\nAbhishek Nair is a freelance journalist based out of Mumbai, with experience in covering sports and education across India.

Photo: iStock\nUncertainty across the ‘big four’ study destinations have hit IDP’s student enrolment pipeline for the 2025 financial year, new documents reveal.\nIt comes as the US continues to be buffeted by an unpredictable Trump administration, the UK looks set to introduce stricter immigration policies and Canada and Australia appear to be keeping restrictive international education policies in place following their respective elections.\nIn a market update released today, the Australia-based education giant predicted that market headwinds would cause its student placement volumes to drop by an estimated 28-30% during this financial year. It cited aggregated visa data across its four biggest markets that show international student numbers are down 28% year on year.\nAmid the continuing “policy uncertainty”, IDP is “completing a detailed review of longer-term cost, productivity, investment and commercial levers”, it said, promising an update in its next financial results announcement in August.\nMeanwhile, IDP expects its language testing volumes to drop between 18% and 20% year on year, although the company said continued strong average fee growth is likely to partially offset the impact on its revenue.\n“This continued uncertainty has impacted IDP student enrolment pipeline size and conversion rates in the important May and June pipeline build given the timing of the fall intake in the UK, Canada and the US, as well as the second semester intake in Australia,” it said.\nIDP’s current estimate is that financial year 2025 EBIT will be “in the range of” $115 million-$125 million”.\nHowever, it said it was “confident in the long-term drivers for the industry” and was “well-placed to grow market share and position strongly for when market conditions improve”.\nPolicy uncertainty and negative rhetoric continues, while economic uncertainty has increased\nIDP Education\nIt said it expects to increase its market share in key markets for student placements, as well as continuing to cut costs to adapt to its short-term financial outlook.\nIDP said it will also complete a review of longer-tern commercial priorities – an update for which will be given in August – as well as investing in new AI projects to underpin long-term growth.\nIn the meantime, IDP said, “policy uncertainty and negative rhetoric continues, while economic uncertainty has increased”. But despite the challenges, it believes the company and the international education sector at large will be able to weather the changes.\n“With a clear strategy, an experienced global team, and a strong balance sheet, IDP remains well-placed to lead the sector through this period and emerge stronger when conditions improve,” it said.\nBeth Kennedy\nBeth Kennedy is a journalist and editor with 10 years experience in specialist media.

Clayesmore School is the group’s first school to be a member of the Heads’ Council (HMC), an association for leaders at some of the world’s most reputable schools.\nILG CEO Amit Mehta described Clayesmore School as “a gem in the educational landscape”.\n“This acquisition underscores our commitment to providing world-class education while preserving the unique character and traditions of every school we partner with. We are excited to work alongside the dedicated staff, students, and families of Clayesmore to build on its remarkable legacy,” he said.\nThe history of the school, which also accepts day pupils, dates back almost 130 years – offering education to pupils in prep school through to senior school and sixth form with a “balanced approach between an international community and traditional British values”, ILG said.\nThis acquisition underscores our commitment to providing world-class education while preserving the unique character and traditions of every school we partner with\nAmit Mehta, ILG\nIts 62-acre campus, located “in the heart” of the West Country county of Dorset, encompasses six boarding houses – with the school known for its “academic reputation and far-reaching global alumni network”, it added.\nILG is a group of independent schools and nurseries around the UK. The company said that its strong track record of “fostering academic, cultural, and personal growth” will help make sure that Clayesmore’s students “will continue to thrive”.\n“The acquisition solidifies ILG’s position as a leader in independent education, uniting both institutions around a shared commitment to excellence and innovation,” it said.\nBeth Kennedy\nBeth Kennedy is a journalist and editor with 10 years experience in specialist media.

This is a natural fit. Enroly brings proven technology and a strong presence across UK higher education.\n“Together, we’ll accelerate innovation for our customers by combining our global reach, trusted government relationships, and experience working with thousands of universities worldwide.\nNicholas Cuthbert\nNick began his career with Nottingham Trent University in the UK working in international student recruitment, before going on to a wide range of leadership and consultancy roles in the private sector.

Photo: Globeducate\nGlobeducate has officially welcomed the International School of Paphos (ISOP) into its global network.\nWith more than 65 bilingual and international schools and online programs across 11 countries, Globeducate serves over 40,000 students worldwide, delivering globally recognised curricula including the National Curriculum for England and the International Baccalaureate.\nEstablished in 1987 by Theodoros Aristodemo, ISOP – the first private English school in Paphos – recently became the latest addition to Globeducate’s presence in Cyprus, which already includes PASCAL International Education and the Education Group Olympion.\nWe are delighted to welcome the International School of Paphos to Globeducate\nLuca Uva, Globeducate\n“We are delighted to welcome the International School of Paphos to Globeducate, further strengthening our presence in Cyprus and our commitment to investment in education on the island,” said Luca Uva, CEO of Globeducate.\n“We are excited to collaborate with the school’s leadership and community to build on its strong foundations. Globeducate is committed to providing students with an outstanding education through a diverse range of national and international curricula, and we look forward to supporting the school in offering even greater opportunities within our global network.”\nThe school’s enriched curriculum, based on the National Curriculum for England, incorporates a strong focus on Greek language and cultural studies, providing students with a well-rounded and globally relevant education.\nAlong with its diverse student cohort and staff from over 40 nationalities, the school is fostering global awareness and cross-cultural practices through various partnerships with cultural and educational institutions such as the British Council, Goethe-Institut, Confucius Institute, French Institute, and several embassies.\nStudents are encouraged to lead and innovate outside of the classroom through initiatives like the Mediterranean Model United Nations (MEDIMUN), the Duke of Edinburgh’s International Award, the European Parliament Ambassador School Programme, and ECO School activities.\nThe school promotes a holistic educational philosophy that combines academic excellence with the cultivation of emotional intelligence, social skills, and self-confidence, while fostering respect and empathy.\nTheodoros Aristodemou, the founder and chairman of the International School of Paphos, said that joining the Globeducate network of schools is undoubtedly a milestone in the school’s journey, which will expand its horizons through this collaboration.\n“We are very proud of what we have achieved over the years, creating a model school at a time when the necessary infrastructure did not even exist in Paphos,” he said.\n“Surely this would not have been possible without the excellent cooperation of our dedicated staff and leadership team, the longstanding support of our parents and students, as well as the smooth supervision of the board of directors.\n“Our decision to collaborate with such an established and esteemed education group like Globeducate was made after careful planning, with the aim of better serving the long-term interests of our community, staff, students, and families.”\nAristi Andriotis, managing director of the International School of Paphos, commented: “As part of the Globeducate family, we will gain access to a wealth of resources, expertise, and support to enhance teaching practices and enrich our students’ learning experiences. Globeducate’s mission, closely aligned with our own, is to prepare each student to become a global citizen who can shape the future.\n“While joining Globeducate offers exciting opportunities, our school’s values and traditions will remain unchanged,” added Andriotis.\nZeina El Qirem\nView all articles by Zeina\n0\nComments\nAdd Your Opinion\nShow Response\nNo comments found.\nLeave Your Comment\nYour email address will not be published.

Photo: Unsplash\nNow a wholly owned subsidiary of Manifest Global, BridgeU joins a growing network of education-focused businesses, including Cialfo.\nBoth BridgeU and Cialfo, with their strong emphasis on international students, provide platforms that help users explore universities, career paths and connect with higher education institutions – offering college and career planning support on a global scale.\nSpeaking to The PIE, BridgeU CEO Patrick Whitfield asserted that BridgeU will remain a standalone brand but noted the benefits of being under the same ownership as Cialfo – allowing the organisation to maintain choice while collaborating on product innovation, shared technology, and best practices.\nRohan Pasari, co-founder and CEO of Manifest Global, said that the acquisition of BridgeU enables the Singapore-headquartered global education investment firm to support more schools and guide even more students on their journey to higher education.\n“This is about combining expertise and accelerating our mission to open up more life-changing opportunities for students by connecting them with universities worldwide,” continued Pasari.\nThis is about combining expertise and accelerating our mission to open up more life-changing opportunities for students\nRohan Pasari, Manifest Global\nFollowing the launch of BridgeU in 2015, the business was acquired by Kaplan in 2021.\nWhitfield described the latest acquisition as a timely opportunity to unite the two companies in support of students, schools, and universities and believes that in Manifest, there is a “great new home” for the organisation which he joined in 2023 as chief commercial officer and promoted the following the year.\n“Schools can choose from two platforms that occupy clear positions within the market and appeal to different schools with different needs. This will make the choice easier for schools and give them confidence that whichever platform they choose, they’ll be accessing high-quality tools and services tailored to their needs,” said Whitfield.\n“For universities, while we are at the early stages, we see a major long-term opportunity through the combined scale of the group. Manifest is bringing together a growing house of brands to offer universities unique opportunities to access a very diverse student audience of prospective undergraduate students who are preparing for international study.”\nConsidering what aspects of business might evolve and what would remain unchanged, Whitfield told The PIE: “Manifest is an ambitious investor that has acquired BridgeU with growth and scale in mind. We are obviously in the early stages but there are exciting opportunities for BridgeU within Manifest thanks to the alignment of our mission, and also the depth of shared expertise within our segment.\n“BridgeU has an exceptionally committed and talented team, and our people have played a key role in building our reputation among schools and university partners. Manifest recognises this and sees our talent, culture, and relationships as key strengths that will support growth.”\nAccording to Pasari, the sector has been “crying out for dedicated undergraduate global solutions” which includes data and insight that can “drive better, more cost-effective recruitment of a diverse range of high-quality students”.\n“Cost-effective solutions with clearly defined ROI have never been more important to universities – at a time of uncertainty, turbulence and in many markets some significant headwinds, institutions need that more than ever,” he said.\nPasari added: “I think we have the opportunity to fill that space and in doing so help more students on their international education journey.”\nThe announcement follows Manifest Global’s recent expansion, which included the addition of Delhi-based Kaaiser Australian Education Experts to its growing portfolio.\nKim Martin\nKim is a journalist specialising in international education, with a keen focus on policy, immigration, and global student recruitment.

Photo: iStock Kuzmichstudio\nEQT, one of the investors, announced the successful completion of the deal on March 20, valuing the company at USD $14.5 billion.\nThis follows the initial acquisition announcement made in October 2024, which noted that global institutional investors would diversify Nord Anglia’s shareholder base and support its long-term growth and stability.\nAcross its schools, Nord Anglia educates more than 90,000 students from ages two to 18, and prides itself on its personalised learning approach.\nOther investors include Neuberger Berman Private Markets, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments), Corporación Financiera Alba, S.A. (CF Alba) and Dubai Holding Investments (Dubai Holding).\nAndrew Fitzmaurice, chief executive officer of Nord Anglia Education, said the operator – known for its partnerships with top institutions like MIT and Juilliard – is “delighted to partner with some of the world’s most respected investors, who share our commitment to educational excellence”.\n“EQT has been an exceptional partner over the years, helping to strengthen our academic programs, invest in research and innovation, and expand our family of schools globally. With the support of our investor group, we are excited about the future and the opportunities this will create to further improve students’ outcomes,” he continued.\nWith the support of our investor group, we are excited about the future and the opportunities this will create to further improve students’ outcomes\nAndrew Fitzmaurice, Nord Anglia Education\nEQT has been described as a “dedicated partner” to Nord Anglia since 2008 and further strengthened its commitment in 2017, when CPP Investments joined as an investor.\nOver this period, EQT has played a central role in strategic M&A, helping Nord Anglia successfully execute more than 21 acquisitions since 2017 that have significantly expanded its footprint and earnings.\nRecent developments in 2024 saw Escola Móbile become the third school in Brazil, alongside The British College of Brazil and Avenues São Paulo, to join the group’s impressive global portfolio.\nThe completion of Nord Anglia’s acquisition also introduces a distinguished group of global financial asset managers or institutions, which significantly broadens and strengthens the company’s ownership structure, a statement from EQT explained.\nThis group includes sovereign wealth funds, insurers, and family offices across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and North America, which the group said “not only enhances Nord Anglia’s long-term stability as a private company but also brings new strategic perspectives, resources, and capital to drive its continued growth”.\nJean Eric Salata, chairperson of EQT Asia and Head of Private Capital Asia, commented: “The strength and diversity of this expanded shareholder base will reinforce the company’s long-term stability, provide additional strategic capital, and unlock new opportunities for innovation. We look forward to this next chapter and to seeing Nord Anglia continue to set new benchmarks in academic excellence and global impact.”\nJack Hennessy, partner at EQT Private Equity, described Nord Anglia as an “outstanding institution that has set new standards for excellence in global private education”.\n“For more than 16 years, we’ve worked closely with the company’s exceptional management team to expand its reach and elevate its academic offering,” said Hennessy.\n“With the completion of this transaction, we are excited to continue this journey with Neuberger Berman, CPP Investments, CF Alba, Dubai Holding and a world-class group of long-term institutional investors, ensuring Nord Anglia is well-positioned for its next stage of growth.”\nKim Martin\nKim is a journalist specialising in international education, with a keen focus on policy, immigration, and global student recruitment.

Photo: iStock\nThe findings come from a study conducted by the German Economic Institute (IW) on behalf of DAAD, which reveals the powerful economic boost international students bring to Germany.\nAround 405,000 international students are currently studying in Germany. The approximately 80,000 international students who began their studies with the intention of graduating in 2022 will pay almost €15.5 billion more in taxes and duties over the course of their lives than they receive in benefits from the German state, according to the research.\n“Although most universities do not charge tuition fees, international students make significantly higher contributions to our society over the course of their working lives than Germany invests in their studies and beyond,” explained DAAD president Joybrato Mukherjee.\n“International students are an asset to our country in many ways, academically of course, but also economically,” he continued.\nInternational students make significantly higher contributions to our society over the course of their working lives than Germany invests in their studies and beyond\nJoybrato Mukherjee, DAAD\nInvesting in international students pays off for Germany after just a few years. If 40% of a cohort remain in the country after graduation, their taxes and contributions will cover the costs of their higher education programs just three years after graduation, the research showed.\nAccording to a recent DAAD survey, around 65% of students intending to graduate plan to stay in the country. OECD research showed that Germany currently has the highest retention rate of international students in the world, along with Canada. A decade after starting their studies, 45% of students are still in Germany.\nIf the retention rate remains stable, each new cohort of international students brings in €15.5bn more in taxes and duties for the public budget than the state has to spend over their lifetime. Even with a retention rate of only 30%, income would exceed expenditure by €7.4bn in the long term. If 50% of a cohort were to remain in Germany in the long term, the surplus would amount to €26bn.\nIW Director Michael Hüther explained that investing in the education of international students strengthens the skilled labour base and thus economic growth of Germany in the long term.\n“They help to overcome the challenges of demographic change. In addition, the investments are highly profitable from a public sector perspective and strengthen public budgets in the long term,” he said.\nDAAD has strengthened its efforts to help international students successfully enter the job market through its skilled workers initiative.\n“We must provide international students who familiarise themselves with Germany during their studies and want to stay here after graduation with the best possible support in starting a career,” said Mukherjee.\nWhile India remains the largest source market for international students in Germany with over 49,000 students in 2023/24, China is the second largest at nearly 39,000, followed by Türkiye, Austria, Iran, Syria, Russia, Italy, Ukraine, Pakistan, Egypt, Morocco, Tunisia, Cameroon, and France.\nKim Martin\nKim is a journalist specialising in international education, with a keen focus on policy, immigration, and global student recruitment.

Photo: Studyportals/Uni-Life\nWith the strategic acquisition of Uni-Life, the Studyportals group said is it taking “another step in offering a holistic solution to support students throughout their entire journey” while elevating universities’ ability to digitally recruit diverse students.\nFor universities, this partnership offers a comprehensive engagement tool that supports students starting from the offer stage, maximising yield to enrolment, and their landing, connectedness and retention after that, a joint statement from the companies explained\nUni-Life was founded in 2019 as a solution to enable students to connect with each other and improve their social experience on campus and was created in response to the challenges many students face in forming connections with their university.\nSince, it has evolved to support both pre- and post-enrolment engagement, helping students build strong social connections from the moment they get accepted until they graduate, while keeping a unique focus on welfare.\nBy joining the Studyportals group, Uni-Life will “expand its reach and impact, enhancing the authentic student-first approach on a global scale,” its statement read.\n“For years, we have recognised the growing demand communities in the study choice process,” said Edwin van Rest, CEO of Studyportals.\n“Uni-Life stands out for having student welfare and retention at its core, while also driving strong economical gains for the university. This aligns perfectly with the broader vision of our offerings: best-fit, best for students, great ROI,” he continued.\n“This acquisition allows us to support students not only in selecting the right study program but also in building connections and feeling at home even before they arrive. Our university partners will enhance both enrolment ratio and student success/retention with minimal effort.

Photo: Axis Education Group\nAxis Education Group, which brings together The Dublin Academy of Education, Independent College, International House Dublin, and Public Affairs Ireland, has unveiled plans for a €7 million investment in a state-of-the-art, 28,000-square-foot campus in the area.\nThe campus, located in the neighbourhood’s former Zurich Insurance building, is being transformed into a modern, energy-efficient school through a €7 million makeover. From September, it will be home to an expanded Dublin Academy of Education, offering a transition year program and able to cater to an “advanced student capacity” of 500.\nIt marks the first major announcement from the Axis Education Group, which was established following a recent share divestment by Padraig Hourigan, president of Independent College. The group is fully Irish-owned, with education entrepreneur Chris Lauder, founder of The Dublin Academy of Education, and investor Donagh Barry as joint owners.\nLauder has taken on the role of Group CEO, while Hourigan remains president of Independent College and assumes the position of group director of strategy and partnerships.\nBy combining the expertise of its four institutions, the group aims to support learners at every stage, whether they are preparing for exams, transitioning to third-level education, improving language proficiency, or advancing in their careers.\nLauder emphasised that education should not just focus on exam preparation but also equip students with the mindset and skills they need for success beyond the classroom.\n“It’s about more than just achieving high grades – it’s about preparing students for life after the Leaving Certificate, helping them develop confidence and the ability to thrive in higher education and their chosen careers,” he said.\nHourigan highlighted the increasing focus on exams and qualifications in today’s education system.\n“Many students see education as just a stepping stone to a job, but real success requires more than just good results,” he said. “Our approach is about giving students both the academic knowledge and the critical thinking skills to apply that knowledge in the real world.”\nAxis Education Group currently employs over 220 staff members and provides both in-person and online educational services to more than 20,000 students, generating a combined turnover of €20 million.\nIt’s about preparing students for life after the Leaving Certificate, helping them develop confidence and the ability to thrive in higher education and their chosen careers\nChris Lauder, Axis Education Group\nIn addition to the Blackrock campus investment, Axis Education Group has ambitious expansion plans for the next two to three years.\nThis includes an increasing the range of postgraduate programs at Independent College, with new offerings in digital business, AI, and business analytics, as well as further expanding the group’s presence in Dublin.\n“Our institutions have already made a transformative impact in the education sector, but we want to do even more,” said Hourigan.\n“With the introduction of the transition year program at the Academy and the expansion of our postgraduate offerings, we’re focused on growing our reach and continuing to innovate in education.”\nZeina El Qirem\nView all articles by Zeina\n0\nComments\nAdd Your Opinion\nShow Response\nNo comments found.\nLeave Your Comment\nYour email address will not be published.

At the time of writing on March 5, Flywire’s stock price stands as $10.60.\nThe company announced several “efficiency measures” to mitigate the impact of the near $16m in losses in the last quarter of 2024, including a restructuring plan impacting 10% of the workforce across global regions and functions.\n“It is difficult to say goodbye to so many FlyMates,” said Flywire CEO Mike Massaro, thanking employees for their hard work and maintaining they would be supported through the transition.\n“Looking ahead, we’re focused on driving effectiveness and discipline throughout our global business,” wrote Massaro in the report.\nFlywire said that the changes would strengthen its focus on “areas of greatest opportunity”, including education, where it continues to “invest in delivering exceptional value to our clients,” vice president for corporate marketing, Sarah King, told The PIE News.\n“Looking ahead, we remain deeply committed to supporting our global education partners, payers, agents, and stakeholders, ensuring we provide the solutions they need to navigate an evolving landscape,” King added.\nDespite the nearly $16m in net losses, Massaro called 2024 a “strong year” for Flywire, which increased its revenue by 17% last quarter, “while navigating a complex macro environment with significant headwinds”.\nLooking ahead, we’re focused on driving effectiveness and discipline throughout our global business\nMike Massaro, Flywire CEO\nAlongside Flywire’s financial losses, it announced the acquisition of Sertifi, a new payment platform for the hotel and travel industry, which it expects to boost revenue by $30-$40m this fiscal year.\nUnder its education vertical, Flywire increased its network of international recruitment agents, with the UK seeing the most growth.\nLate last year, the company announced a stream of new partnerships, including one with GradGuard tuition insurance provider and another with Vietnam National Bank.\n“Our dedication to the success of the institutions we serve has never been stronger, and we are excited about the opportunities ahead to further enhance our impact in the education sector,” said King.\nPolly Nash\nPolly graduated with a degree in History and English Literature from the University of Edinburgh during which she did a year abroad in sunny Santa Barbara.

Photo: iStock gorodenkoff\nThe AI platform Capio, which launched last week as a separate legal entity to ApplyBoard, promises an “end-to-end” system that helps universities manage their international student enrolment.\n“The international education sector is experiencing unprecedented transformation, yet institutions continue to rely on disconnected legacy systems and manual processes,” said Capio’s general manager, Darin Lee.\n“We created Capio to revolutionise how institutions approach enrolment management, providing them with sophisticated solutions that solve their biggest challenges. This is not just about automating existing processes – it’s about creating frictionless, intuitive enrolment journeys.”\nCapio operates independently of ApplyBoard, which means it is available to all institutions, “regardless of their existing recruitment partnerships” and “maintains strict data protection protocols” while also integrating well with institutions’ existing systems, the company said.\n“As institutions face fragmented systems, manual processes, and resource constraints while working to meet enrolment targets, Capio’s integrated end-to-end platform streamlines planning and execution,” the company said.\nThe international education sector is experiencing unprecedented transformation, yet institutions continue to rely on disconnected legacy systems and manual processes\nDarin Lee, Capio\nCapio refers to itself as “a comprehensive suite of solutions designed for modern institutions” with “real-time” insights on student visas, integrated agent management, AI-driven enrolment planning tools and compliance tracking.\nThe news comes amid claims that ApplyBoard’s valuation – which was once thought to have hit $3.2 billion – has dropped sharply, with an analysis of its Fidelity funds by OPM Wire indicating the company’s value has declined by as much as 74% from its peak valuation.\nIn response, ApplyBoard told The PIE News that such valuations only represent “a moment in time” and stressed that it is actually primed for further growth.\nBeth Kennedy\nBeth Kennedy is a journalist and editor with 10 years experience in specialist media.
