Photo: iStock.\nThe study, published by the Institue of International Education (IIE), outlines the importance of expanding international study to the US over the next five years as American universities brace for an impending domestic “enrolment cliff”.\n“Attracting global talent is crucial to driving the US economy and growth, and maintaining US leadership” IIE’s head of research, evaluation and learning Mirka Martel told The PIE News.\nMartel, co-author of the Outlook 2030 Brief, highlighted the unique capacity of the US to host more international students, who currently make up just 6% of the overall student population.\nIn comparison, international students comprise a much larger proportion of the total student body in the UK (27%), Australia (31%) and Canada (38%).\nNotably, 36 US states were identified by IIE with international student populations below the 6% line, with Massachusetts, New York and Washington DC the regions with the highest proportions of international students.\nMeanwhile, US universities are facing a much reported on domestic enrolment cliff, with government figures showing undergraduate enrolment declining by more than two million between 2010 and 2022.\nWhat’s more, projections indicate that the number of high school graduates will peak in 2025 and decline by 13% by 2041, with IIE warning that US colleges and universities will be left with “empty seats” if they do not focus on international enrolments.\nDespite recent reports of declining student interest in the US driven by the Trump administration’s hostile policies, IIE’s Fall 2024 Snapshot predicted a 3% growth in international student levels in the 2024/15 academic year.\nMartel said she expected this forecast to hold true, pointing to the “exciting” fall increase in undergraduate rates for the first time since Covid and the continuing increase in Optional Practical Training (OPT) stemming from rising graduate rates over the last three years.\nOutside the US, the total number of globally mobile students has seen exponential growth in recent years, nearly doubling over the past decade to reach 6.9 mil in 2024.\nWith last year witnessing the largest growth since the pandemic, some expect global mobility to exceed 9 million by 2030, driven by the growth of youthful populations in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa.\nThis, the report says, will create “a steady pipeline of students seeking future academic study”, highlighting the case of Nigeria where the country’s universities can only admit one-third of the two million annual applicants due to capacity constraints.\nElsewhere in India, domestic institutions have significantly expanded their undergraduate studies, but “there remains a strong interest in pursuing graduate studies abroad,” according to IIE.\nAttracting global talent is crucial to driving the US economy and growth\nMirka Martel, IIE\nIn 2023/24, the number of international students in the US reached a record level of 1.1 million, which was primarily driven by a surge in OPT rather than new enrolments.\nIIE’s 2030 Outlook highlights the $50bn contribution of international students to the US in 2024, with California ($6.4bn), New York ($6.3bn) and Massachusetts ($3.9) reaping the highest economic benefits.\nWhat’s more, last year international students created nearly 400,000 jobs in the US, with the report highlighting their role in driving innovation in key industries, as more than half of international students in the US graduate from STEM fields.\nIt points to Chamber of Commerce predictions of incoming labour market shortages across healthcare, computer and mathematical sciences, and business and financial operations, with international students with US training well-poised to fill the gaps.\nBeyond the numbers, “[international students] are a political and economic asset for America,” states the report: broadening perspectives in the classroom and furthering business, cultural, economic and political ties after they return home.\nPolly Nash\nPolly graduated with a degree in History and English Literature from the University of Edinburgh during which she did a year abroad in sunny Santa Barbara. She went on to study International Journalism at City, University of London.

Here are a few reasons why The PIE Live continues to be the hottest ticket in town for international educators.\nby Nicholas Cuthbert\nJune 16 2025\n8 Min Read\nShare\nCopied!\n0\nAdd Your Opinion\nThe PIE Live Asia Pacific conference has become one of the highlights of the annual events calendar and often creates a sense of FOMO because of the beautiful location on Australia’s Gold Coast.\nThis is the first major gathering for the sector since the Albanese government was re-elected, so there is plenty to unpack.\nThe agenda has been announced and we have highlighted 10 reasons that make this conference unmissable:\n1. Meet the ministers – government departments gather on the Gold Coast\nWe are delighted that representatives from Austrade, the Department of Education (DfE), the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency, and the National Student Ombudsman will all be in attendance at this year’s conference for closed meetings with education stakeholders on Monday July 28.\nFelix Pirie (ITECA), Luke Sheehy (UA), Phil Honeywood (IEAA), Simone Fuller (DfE) are just a few of the confirmed speakers relaying the dialogue with government to the wider sector, including ongoing discussion with MPs Jason Clare and Julian Hill. Stay up to speed with the latest happenings, as parliament sits for the first time since the summer recess.\nCheck out: Tuesday, July 29 – ‘Policy update – the next steps for Australia; Monday, July 28 – Australian Government Future Focus Dialogue: Australian international education and skills (invite-only)’\n2. PIE High puts schools centre-stage\nOn Day 2 of this year’s conference, we have opened-up a FREE track of sessions bringing together colleagues from the secondary schools sector from across the region, helping them to connect with international recruitment agents and market experts while sharing key insights. By making this accessible to school colleagues, we aim to bridge the gap to higher education, and broaden wider discussions on wellbeing, AI and visa policy.\nAttendees include Alice Springs Smith School (Malaysia), Shafston College (Australia), Sekolah Bogor Raya (Indonesia), John Paul College (Australia), SACE International (Australia), Langports (Australia), Inforum Education (Australia), Education Queensland International (Australia) AIIU (Australia) – will you be there?\nRegister your interest for the free PIE High track here.\n3. Rage against the machine\nBy now, you’re either an AI evangelist or you think it’s the stuff of nightmares. We will be testing the mood of the sector live, with a stage debate asking if AI will enhance or damage higher education. Will the snake eat itself or will we reach a higher plane of productivity? Our audience will decide.\nOur debaters include tech-entrepreneurs, marketing directors, university presidents and national AI-council directors. Each will make the case for or against, in a session that promises to polarise opinion!\nCheck out: Tuesday, July 29 – ‘Live debate: rage against the machine – will AI enhance or damage higher education?’\n4. PIEx will silently inspire you\nOur ‘Power Up’ silent seminars have landed down under as we bring you inspirational talks in a brand new format. Located at the heart of our expo, The PIEx stage features personal headphones for the audience to wear to listen to speakers.\nThink TEDx meets Silent Disco, as we curate a range of elevator pitches, demos and talks on a wide range of topics including edtech, sustainability, student entrepreneurship, widening participation and wellbeing. Even the seasoned conference-goer will find something new here. Intimate and authentic\nCheck out: The PIEx stage including Ailsa Lamont, Rob Lawrence, Mikhail Eremeev and Southern Cross University.\n5. Data superstars present one killer statistic each – prepare to have your mind blown\nWithout data, you’re just another person with an opinion. Get ready to supercharge your strategies with the very best data, statistics and facts you can find. This is a roll-call of true data superstars aiming to change your perspective through killer insights.\nClaire Field, Steve Nerlich, Keri Ramirez, Patrick Brothers, Jon Chew, Lyndell Jacka, Carlie Sage – all back-to-back in a quick fire assault on your senses. get your camera ready to capture these amazing info-graphics.\nCheck out: Wednesday, July 30 – ‘Data superstars present one killer statistic each that will blow your mind’\n“A view from the top will put international education into context of the wider challenges universities face”\n6. Visas, asylum, genuine students and legal immigration agents\nWe have officially entered a new, managed era of edu-immigration and the stakes are high. The financial reality of MD111 and MD106 are hitting the sector hard. From visa rejections to ELICOS closures, we will take stock of the current state of play – then attempt to chart a way forward. The time for speculation has past, the new government is committed to reducing net migration and new systems are needed to face that reality.\nCheck out: Tuesday, July 29 – ‘Expert community: agents and immigration consultants speak’; Wednesday, July 30 – ‘Visas and asylum: MD111 and MD106 mapping – is the current visa system working?’\n7. VC / President / PVCi – Ask me anything\nWe used to invite university executives on stage to share their perspective of the bigger picture in higher education. Now we invite them to a roundtable so you can personally grill them on anything, from finances, to technology, to free speech.\nDon’t be shy, you can literally ask them anything. Delegates will gain a wider appreciation of all the factors at play in running a university in this climate, while university leaders will hear perspectives from the chalk-face. You don’t have to be a VIP to gain access to this session, this is about breaking down barriers.\nCheck out: Tuesday, July 29 – ‘VC / PVCi ask me anything roundtable’\n8. Leveraging the expertise in the audience\nThe PIE Live has forged a reputation as a conference where leaders go to network and share knowledge. The reality is that our audience is inter-changeable with any speaker on stage – so we have reinvented the conference format to create more expert communities, town halls and workshops to facilitate discussion and learning.\nOur reviews speak for themselves. We encourage you to get involved, raise the bar and face your challenges head-on with like-minded colleagues. Expert communities include TNE, alliances, agents, female leaders, K-12 and student voice.\nCheck out: ‘Expert community: TNE and University Alliances’; ‘Expert community: agents and immigration consultants speak’; ‘Expert community: Indigenous knowledges in Asia Pacific universities’; and ‘Workshop: female leaders discuss how to find their voice (and be heard)’\n9. The rise of APAC: discover an Asian-centred ecosystem\nPopulation, economic growth and Western culture-wars all point to an increasingly Asian-centred world and education sector. We have picked some of the hottest study hubs across the region to explain the growing demand for Asian students to study in Asia.\nFrom branch campuses to TNE articulations, our experts will be showing just how you can get involved. Countries presenting at this year’s conference include Malaysia, New Zealand, India and Korea – in addition to recognition of indigenous knowledge from across the Pacific.\nCheck out: APAC special guests include Dr Jaeho Yeom (president, Taejae University); Amanda Malu (Education New Zealand);\nMohammad Amin Mohammad Taff (vice-chancellor, Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris, Malaysia), Amritpal Kaur (Chitkara University India), Jemaima Tiatia-Siau (pro-vice chancellor, University of Aukland) and Kyuseok Kim (IES Abroad Korea).\n10. Cybersecurity and digital transformation\nOur keynote comes from the US consulate about security issues and wider geopolitical pressures. This is brought into stark reality in our Tech-stack panel on the pitfalls of digital transformation – and our demo of AI agents as we talk to a robot university counsellor live on stage. Expect practical tips on how to embrace technology alongside sobering reminders of just how high stakes the risks can be.\nCheck out: Tuesday, July 29 – My robot university counsellor – AI demo; Wednesday, July 30 – ‘Beyond our control: how geopolitics & security issues impacting international education’; Expert community: Tech stack – improving the digital student journey.\nThe PIE Live APAC will take place July 29-30, 2025, at HOTA: Home of the Arts on the Gold Coast.
