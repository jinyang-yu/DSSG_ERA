Our partnership with BUC is built on a shared mission to empower students with the skills, knowledge and mindset needed for lifelong success,” she added.\nThe inaugural intake of students is set for October 2025.\nVice chairman of BUC, Hassan Al-Derham, said the partnership ensures Qatar’s next generation “gains access to top-tier Australian education here at home, aligned with the nation’s vision for innovation and leadership”.\nWe are not just offering degrees – we are opening doors. Doors to global classrooms, powerful ideas, and careers that don’t yet exist, but will\nHassan Al-Derham, BUC\n“We are not just offering degrees – we are opening doors. Doors to global classrooms, powerful ideas, and careers that don’t yet exist, but will,” he added.\nAl-Derham brings to the institute a wealth of experience, having served as president of Qatar University from 2015 to 2023.\nBUC’s leadership also includes Sheikh Abdullah bin Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani, a member of the ruling family and former Prime Minister of Qatar from 2013-2020.\nThe Qatar National Vision 2030 aims to transform the country into a knowledge-based economy, making initiatives like BUC – and its international partnerships – a key part of the nation’s strategy to diversify and strengthen its higher education sector.\nIn a statement, Swinburne described how the industry-aligned degrees are set to empower students with the practical skills needed for “Qatar’s evolving economy” and aligning with the 2030 Vision.\nKim Martin\nKim is a journalist specialising in international education, with a keen focus on policy, immigration, and global student recruitment.
