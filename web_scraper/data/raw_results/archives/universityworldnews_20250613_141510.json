There has been head-spinning expansion from a small postgraduate institution four years ago to more than 560 postgraduate students and researchers today, and this August the first undergraduates arrive.\n“There’s a lot going on,” admits Professor Timothy Baldwin, an internationally respected AI expert who has worked at top universities around the world. He is provost of MBZUAI, or Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence, named after the UAE president. An understatement, perhaps.\nThe university has grown very fast, despite a tight AI focus. The first postgraduate students were admitted in January 2021. Two years ago there were 52 faculty and 202 students. Today there are more than 84 faculty, and the university has 365 masters and PhD students and more than 200 postdocs and researchers. There are seven masters and six PhD programmes.\nAll students are fully funded. The first undergraduate students will swell the numbers further. Baldwin reckons that at this rate, in a few years MBZUAI will need physical expansion too.\nAlready the university is ranked highly in the global Computer Science or CS Rankings. For 2024 to 2025 it is number 14 globally in the two specialist areas of computer vision and natural language processing and 31 in machine learning. In AI, the top of the CS Rankings is dominated by Chinese universities.\nIn the past 18 months, the university has launched multiple initiatives. They include five new departments and the MBZUAI Incubation and Entrepreneurship Centre that supports AI-driven start-ups and has produced 15 so far from faculty and students.\nAn Institute of Foundation Models was launched in April that supports AI development in the Global South. The university has built major open-source models like K2 and JAIS – an Arabic-centric large language model (LLM) – as well as models for under-represented languages. It has engineering offices in Paris and (soon) the Bay Area in California and co-founded GenBio AI for biological foundation models and research.\nBaldwin spoke to University World News about the “incredible luxury” of having a clean slate when creating a university from scratch. Research and curriculum freedom, generous government funding, top researchers and no grumpy faculty resisting change.\nI first interviewed him two years ago, when MBZUAI had been going for two years, and was keen to see how this unusual AI university has been progressing.\nTurning internationalisation on its head\nMBZUAI and some other new universities in the Middle East are turning higher education internationalisation on its head. They are mostly situated in the politically stable countries of the UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, where governments are investing heavily in universities and research.\nWith well-funded programmes and research and competitive salaries, they are attracting growing numbers of international students and staff.\nCurrently, some 80% of MBZUAI’s students are international, from 49 countries, and about 20% are UAE nationals – usually the international-to-local proportions are the other way around. A similar split is expected at the undergraduate level, although the proportion of UAE students might be slightly higher. Most faculty are also international.\n“The undergraduate programme was only announced in March, and in the ‘exceptional talent’ track there are students from countries ranging from Kazakhstan to Brazil, Serbia to China, and Indonesia to America,” said Baldwin, formerly of the University of Melbourne in Australia.\n“They really do come from around the world and from all walks of life, which is something we’re emphasising. Our students should not just be classic science wunderkinds,” he noted. The university is also looking for young people with drive and passion, he said, who excel in diverse fields, such as athletes or musicians, and from different cultural backgrounds.\nInterestingly, more than 30% of students are female – very unusual for an AI institution. Baldwin said the university is shooting for at least half of students being women.\nAre there concerns about having enough local students? Baldwin said there will be around 100 students in the first undergraduate intake. Next year, there will be around 300 students. “So, from a relatively small UAE population, about three million, the absolute numbers become significant very quickly,” he stated.\nMBZUAI and the UAE national AI strategy\nMBZUAI is an essential part of the UAE National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2031, which places AI development at the centre of economic strategy. It aims for the UAE to be a global AI leader by 2031.\nConsiderable progress has been made. Stanford University’s Global AI Vibrancy Tool ranks the UAE as fifth in the world after the United States, China, the United Kingdom and India. “It’s a fantastic achievement for the country. And we can see the university’s fingerprints all over that,” said Baldwin.\nMBZUAI has helped to attract foreign direct investment. IBM set up a collaboration on campus earlier this year, and two major Microsoft centres have been announced in partnership with G42, a local AI company. Google sponsors the university directly. “We are here, and people want to work with us,” Baldwin commented.\nThe MBZUAI Incubation and Entrepreneurship Centre supports AI innovation, and like many other researchers, Baldwin is involved in a start-up. LibrAI helps organisations to implement safer, more reliable and better generative AI systems. It does a lot of work in aligning LLMs with local cultures and values and is expanding into agentic AI.\nMBZUAI President Eric Xing – a world-renowned computer scientist and expert in machine learning, who has taught at top American universities – co-founded the GenBio AI start-up, which says it is “Building the world’s first AI-driven digital organism”, AIDO.\nThe university also does a lot of work in AI training. There is an executive programme as well as bespoke offerings for companies and government entities. “We’ve trained many thousands of people through these programmes,” Baldwin said.\nExpanding into undergraduate training\nPostgraduate students have the skills to work in a research environment, but the main demand for AI skills is at the lower level, according to Baldwin. The aim of the undergraduate programme is to provide top-flight students with technical skills and business smarts as well as understanding of the world and of the complexities of data and AI problems.\n“We were always going to go undergraduate. It was just a question of exactly when we flipped the switch. The reason for doing graduate first was about quality. It’s hard to develop a truly world-class, stand-alone undergraduate programme. It’s much easier to establish the graduate school first and then build down from there, off strengths that you have,” he noted.\nIn the world of AI, it is unusual to find an academic programme that is not retrofitted to a computer science undergraduate major or degree. MBZUAI asked industry what it needed, and the feedback was that graduates even from top universities around the world are not job ready.\nOne strategy to address this problem could be to align the core curriculum with what is happening in industry. Another could be to draw on faculty with industry experience. “This is the case for a lot of faculty in the AI space nowadays,” Baldwin said.\nUndergraduate students will do meaningful AI work right from the start. They will enter one of two tracks: a BSc in AI – Engineering or a BSc in AI – Business. The engineering track focuses on AI model development and deployment across the breadth of AI in different sectors, while the business track centres on AI business integration and entrepreneurship.\n“Cross-disciplinary training and hands-on learning will be the cornerstone of the programme. Students will embrace the humanities, business and a liberal arts curriculum, as they work well outside the bounds of classic computer science and STEM,” the university said when announcing the undergraduate programme in March.\n“Furthermore, they will engage in co-operative industry placements, internships, mentorships, and partnerships with top players in industry and AI research.”\nMBZUAI has strong connections with industry. It draws on people from industry to teach what is happening with AI at the coalface. And there is a strong focus on experiential learning and on industry placement. Undergraduates will spend one out of four years in industry or AI research contexts, “with a lot of mentoring to make sure they’re learning along the way”.\nStaying ahead of the AI curve\nGiven the rapid evolution of AI, MBZUAI’s links with industry are important for keeping up with the field. Of course, universities around the world are driving aspects of AI development, but there is even more AI research happening in the private sector.\nBeing a postgraduate-strong university means there are faculty who are innovating at the edge of the field, so academic content is going to be up-to-date. But universities can’t hope to compete directly with research from the likes of Google DeepMind: its team that built the Gemini multimodal LLM has 5,000 people.\n“Having said that, we’re one of a very small number of universities in the world that are training commercially relevant major LLM models and foundation models more generally,” he noted.\nMBZUAI has been expanding and diversifying its academic programme. In 2024 it started five new departments – in computational biology, computer science, human-computer interaction, robotics, and statistics and data science – and another five will be launched this year.\nThis represents a shift outside the core AI that includes computer science, natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning and robotics. There will be three broad areas: life sciences, decision science, and the existing AI-focused provision.\nThe shift to the life sciences led to a School of Digital Public Health. New departments include computational biology, precision medicine and systems epidemiology, with faculty spanning both core life sciences and AI expertise.\n“The idea is that in co-locating life scientists with the core AI departments, magic will happen. There is so much potential in terms of applications of AI to the life sciences, as we saw last year with the Nobel Prize in biology. That’s the accelerating effect of AI in research,” Baldwin said.\nThe School of Decision Science will focus on behavioural economics, operations research and policy using AI-driven digital simulations. MBZUAI is also introducing an engineering-focused master’s in applied AI, targeting non-AI graduates seeking real-world AI application skills.\nThe university has been involved in building foundation models – large and versatile AI models trained on massive amounts of data that may be adapted to many tasks – and in April it launched an Institute of Foundation Models.\nFoundation models for biology are being led by GenBio AI. Other achievements are an Arab-centric model called JAIS and a major English language LLM called K2, under the open-source initiative LLM 360. It is aimed at the Global South, to help democratise access to AI development. Models are also underway for under-represented languages in Asia and Africa.\nMBZUAI has opened offices in Paris and soon in the Bay Area, to support global collaboration and attract top talent. “We’re hiring as we speak,” said Baldwin. In five years, MBZUAI expects to have around 400 faculty, 1,000 postdocs and engineers, 1,000 PhD students and 1,000 undergraduates.\n“So, it’s grow, grow, grow,” he concluded.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Global experts will explore ways of embedding sustainability skills and awareness in teaching and learning, and across universities, in a free webinar on Thursday 26 June.\nFree Webinar: Thursday 26 June. 16:00 BST\nREGISTER HERE\nThe international experts will debate how individual academics, staff and universities can become agents for sustainable change in the webinar titled “Time to Act: Embedding sustainability in higher education”, co-hosted by University World News and ABET, the global quality assurance and accreditation agency.\nThe panelists are Professor Fernando Reimers of Harvard University, an expert in education policy, global education and education for sustainability; Dr Debra Rowe, president of the US Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development; Dr Ratna Lindawati Lubis, a professor at Telkom University in Indonesia and an entrepreneurship education expert; and Dr Michael KJ Milligan, CEO of ABET, which has embedded sustainability criteria in its higher education accreditation standards.\nModerated by Brendan O’Malley, editor-in-chief of University World News, the experts will field a range of questions.\nFor instance: How might faculty embed sustainability knowledge and skills into existing curricula and courses, equipping students with awareness of sustainability issues and preparing them with the skills to become sustainability drivers in the future workforce? And how might university leaders and staff advance an institution-wide focus on sustainability through policies, strategies, training and support? What are the good practice examples?\nThe webinar will discuss how universities – under increasing pressure to align with global sustainability targets – can act now to embed sustainability as a core institutional value rather than an add-on, and support faculty in their sustainability efforts. The discussion will include insights into balancing global frameworks like the SDGs with local relevance, ensuring that sustainability teaching and learning is meaningful and context-specific.\nAs with all University World News-ABET webinars, the aim will be to combine high-level debate with practical guidance. Participants will come away with real-world examples, ideas and approaches that academics can apply directly to their own teaching and curriculum design – whether they’re new to sustainability or already engaging with it in their work.\nThe webinar will be held on Thursday 26 June at: 8.00am LA, 11am NYC, 4pm London, 5pm Cape Town and 8.30pm Delhi.\nSpeakers\nProfessor Fernando M Reimers is the Ford Foundation Professor of the Practice of International Education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where he leads the Global Education Innovation Initiative. He is an expert in the field of education policy, global education, and more latterly on aligning curriculum with the SDGs. Aside from many other prestigious appointments, he is an elected member of the National Academy of Education, the International Academy of Education and the Council on Foreign Relations.\nDr Debra Rowe is internationally respected for her work in education and sustainability. She is president of the US Partnership for Education for Sustainable Development, and co-authored the UNEP Global Guidance for Education on Green Jobs. Rowe is a leader of the Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI), a partnership between 10 United Nations entities and the global higher education community, co-chairing two of its action groups – Education for Green Jobs and its SDG Publishers Compact Fellows programme.\nProfessor Ratna Lindawati Lubis is a professor of economics and business at Telkom University in West Java, Indonesia, and a fellow of the SDG Publishers Compact of the United Nations’ Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI). She has a PhD in higher education administration and is an expert in entrepreneurship education and strategic management, which she has taught for more than two decades.\nDr Michael KJ Milligan is CEO of ABET, a global organisation assuring quality in higher education through accreditation and assessment. He was previously a systems director at the Aerospace Corporation, where he led a team at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center developing environmental satellites for NOAA. A former US Air Force officer, Milligan holds a PhD in electrical engineering from the University of Texas at Austin, along with degrees from Michigan State University, the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, and Western New England College.\nModerator\nBrendan O’Malley: Editor-in-chief of University World News.\nDuration\n60 to 90 minutes.\nREGISTER HERE NOW\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The items each will be offered at 90% off regular prices. The offerings will be finalised after preference surveys, according to the provincial government.\nThe new project marks the first initiative stemming from Gyeonggi’s ‘Social Innovation Platform’, a social contribution programme launched in March that aims to tackle social problems such as climate change, demographic shifts and child care “in creative and innovative ways”.\nFull report on the Korea JoongAng Daily site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The introduction of well-defined career paths – with transparent promotion criteria – means that lecturers, researchers and instructors will now have clearer opportunities for advancement, recognition and growth. For the first time, senior academics will be eligible for sabbatical leave, allowing them to take time off to pursue research or contribute to public service without losing their positions or pay.\nAt the centre of these efforts is a new Prime Ministerial Order that introduces a new way of managing academic staff and builds on a reform journey that began more than a decade ago. Together with a new financing model that gives UR more freedom to raise its own money, these changes are meant to make Rwanda’s higher education system more professional, more competitive globally, and less dependent on government funding.\nFull report on the KT Press site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

These 24/7 digital assistants, nicknamed ‘electronic colleagues’ by their human counterparts, are transforming student services, writes Shen Sheng for Global Times.\nAt Beijing Jiaotong University, an AI counsellor recently sent an in-app survey to undergraduate student Kong Lingyan, asking: “Would you consider working in western China?” The message was sent by Han Baitao, deputy secretary of the Party Committee of the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, through the AI platform, said the China Youth Daily. According to the report, the survey received over 500 views within just 30 minutes, and 254 students submitted detailed responses. Based on these responses, Han used the AI system to distribute a more targeted questionnaire to 1,295 students. The system successfully identified 32 students who expressed a clear interest in working or volunteering in western regions of China.\nAt the same time, students with other needs were also flagged and provided with personalised guidance. For instance, students interested in tech R&D received case studies on how eastern high-tech enterprises are contributing to environmental restoration efforts in western China, while those focused on urban development insights into central and western Chinese cities aligned with the Belt and Road Initiative.\nFull report on the Global Times site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Then came generative AI tools like ChatGPT, capable of producing essays and answering complex questions in seconds. In the United States, reports of rampant AI cheating led to an explosion in sales of ‘blue books’ used for old-fashioned pen-and-paper exams this school year.\nIn Canada, some professors are making a similar move amid widespread reports of AI cheating, while others are testing out oral exams or finding ways to incorporate AI. Six in 10 Canadian students said they use generative AI for their schoolwork, according to an October 2024 study from KPMG in Canada.\nFull report on the CBC News site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",
