African land convoy to Gaza\nWagdy Sawahel  12 June  2025\nTweet\rAcademics, students and unions representing professionals including doctors, engineers, journalists and lawyers, have joined civil society associations from Tunisia, Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria in a North African convoy that is heading to Gaza to support the Palestinian people amid a worsening humanitarian crisis – in breach of Israel’s 18-year blockade of the Gaza Strip.\nThe Maghreb Resilience Convoy, also known as Sumoud – Arabic for resilience or steadfastness – will travel across land from Tunisia through Libya and Egypt to reach Rafah, the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, that has remained largely closed since Israel’s military took control of the area in May 2024.\nIt set off from central Tunis on 9 June, at the same time the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an aid ship that set sail from Sicily earlier this month, was seized by Israeli forces.\nFollowing the seizure of the aid ship, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israel would not allow anyone to break the blockade of Gaza, which was aimed at preventing the supply of arms to Hamas, MSN reported.\nThe Maghreb Resilience Convoy was organised by the  Joint Action Coordination Committee for Palestine in Tunisia.\nThe protest is supported by major national organisations, with a group of prominent Tunisian civil society actors participating, including the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT), the National Union of Tunisian Journalists, the National Order of Lawyers in Tunisia, the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights, the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, the Order of Tunisian Doctors, the Tunisian Association of Young Lawyers, the Tunisian Organisation of Young Doctors, the Association of One Million Rural Women and Landless, and the Tunisian Network to Confront the Normalisation System (referring to diplomatic relations with Israel).\nThe UGTT, Tunisia’s largest labour union, is an umbrella organisation that includes student movements, academic associations and university-based unions, including the General Federation of Higher Education and Scientific Research (La Fédération Générale de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche Scientifique).\nWassim Ben Messaoud, the secretary general of the Tunisian General Union of Students, in a statement on 9 June said the union supported the convoy, accusing Israel of waging “genocidal war” and “systematic starvation of more than two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, in full view of all the ‘civilized’ countries of the world”.\n“We call on all students, youth organisations, and students in Tunisia and the Arab and Islamic world to actively engage in supporting Palestinian rights and participate in international solidarity activities,” Ben Messaoud added.\nMohamed El-Koury Ahmed Ibrahim, the president of the Association of Mauritanian Students in Tunisia, told University World News it was supporting the convoy, in particular through a media and awareness campaign.\nA broader global initiative\nThe convoy is part of a global initiative called the Global March To Gaza which involves about 30 countries from Europe, South America and Southeast Asia and is supported by organisations across the globe.\nAs the North Africa group set off from central Tunis on 9 June, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an aid ship that set sail from Sicily earlier this month as part of the global initiative, was seized by Israeli forces.\nIn response, the Arab and Maghreb Youth Student Front in a statement on 9 June criticised the action, saying there was no tolerance for any “free act of solidarity, even if it is peaceful and civil”.\n“Hence, our responsibility, as Arab and Maghreb student and youth forces, grows to … support every action that contributes to lifting the siege and strengthening the steadfastness of the Palestinian people,” the statement read, also calling for a global movement of convoys, marches and mass-sit ins to stop the siege on Gaza.\nOrganisations that are supporting the convoy and broader international effort include the University of Cape Town (UCT) Alumni for Palestine, or UCTA4P, as well as representatives from the Universidad Nacional del Sur, Argentina, Academicxs por Palestina Mexico, the University of Toronto Divest, Canada, the Asociación Taller de Educación en Valores Alternativos, Spain, the Overseas Indonesian Students Association Alliance, Indonesia, and the Observatory Against the Militarization of Schools and Universities, Italy, as well as Teachers Against Genocide in the United States.\nEn route to Rafah\nThe convoy aims to halt in Rafah from 15 to 19 June, but this will depend on authorisations from the Egyptian government.\nThe Joint Action Coordination Committee for Palestine called for facilitating the convoy’s passage through Arab territories by providing political and logistical support.\nThe statement warned against “official Arab and international silence” regarding what is happening in Gaza, describing it as a “moral and humanitarian disgrace”.\nOn 11 June the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that the entire population of Gaza was experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, with one million facing emergency levels, and 470,000 facing “catastrophic levels” of food insecurity.\nHumanitarian crisis\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) reported on 10 June that since a limited resumption of humanitarian assistance into Gaza on 19 May, it has only been able to bring in small amounts of life-saving food and aid, “largely due to delays or denials of permission for humanitarian movements due to expanded military operations”.\nIt said in the past almost three weeks it has transported 700 trucks of aid into Gaza compared to the same number every day during the ceasefire.\n“After nearly 80 days of a total blockade of aid, and a trickle of assistance since the reopening, the fear of starvation inside Gaza remains high,” WFP said.\nIt has only been able to bring in enough supplies to support less than 300,000 people for a month with minimal daily food requirements, a small fraction of what is needed for a population of 2.1 million people.\n“To stave off starvation, stabilise markets and calm desperation, we need to consistently support the entire population with basic food requirements every month.”\nAdditionally, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the ongoing fuel blockade, now entering its fourth month, is placing life-sustaining services – including health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities – at severe risk.\nOn 4 June, the estimated death toll in Gaza, following Israel’s military operation stood at 54,607 (including about 8,304 women and 15,613 children) and 125,341 people had been injured, according to OCHA, which also indicated that 87,000 tertiary students are left without access to formal learning spaces, and 2,308 educational facilities, including universities, have been destroyed.\nIsrael’s military attack was triggered by the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel during which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 hostages were seized. According to OCHA, on 4 June, an estimated 58 hostages remain in Gaza.\nHamas said its 7 October attacks were a response to Israel’s continuing military occupation of Palestine, and Israel continuing construction of illegal settlements in occupied territory, according to Al Jazeera.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is seeking to destroy Hamas and achieve the release of the 58 hostages, Reuters reported. According to the BBC, it is believed that more than half of the hostages still held by Hamas are dead.\nThe International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Prime Minister Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and Hamas Commander Mohammed Deif, for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.\nIsrael also faces a genocide case, brought by South Africa, at the International Court of Justice in relation to its war on Gaza.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The student explained that his leg was hurting, but Abanikanda asked whether standing was meant to placate him or make him comfortable.\nI will make many things pain you, not just your leg. I will make your heart pain you [sic]. I will keep you here, and I have the authority to do it.â\nAbanikanda, when contacted by University World News on 4 June, said that, while he was aware that allegations against him were being circulated on social media, they should not be taken seriously. He explained that the matter was currently under investigation, and he was not willing to make any statements that the university could later use against him.\nBut, according to the dean, the practices on the departmental farm aligned with what other institutions were doing and what was being prescribed by the National Universities Commission (NUC).\nSuspension\nLASU has since suspended Abanikanda, reported Nigeriaâs Foundation for Investigative Journalism and has constituted a fact-finding committee to investigate the matter.\nThe National Association of Nigerian Students (Southwest Zone D) also issued a statement condemning Abanikanda over what it called a âconsistent pattern of tyranny, intimidation and abuse of powerâ spanning more than two decades, as also reported by Sahara Reporters.\nIn 2016, LASU demoted Abanikanda from professor to senior lecturer for allegedly lacking the requisite credentials, reported Premium Times.\nStudents demand action\nOn 17 May this year, fourth-year agriculture students were working on a new farm to plant cassava. Having been dissatisfied with the pace of the work, Abanikanda ordered some of the students to stand in the sun as punishment and asked fifth-year students to abandon their lectures and join in. The students were left outside while Abanikanda remained in his apartment.\nAccording to Adejo Yusuph, an alumnus of the department, it had rained earlier that morning, and some of the students had left home as early as 7am. Many had not eaten or were without shelter until about 7pm, when some of them left.\nWhen Abanikanda finally came out, he was furious, according to Yusuph, and threatened to fail those who had left. âAfter releasing them, some didnât say thank you, so he made them stay until 10.30pm. He let them go only when the video started trending,â Yusuph told University World News.\nHe added that Abanikanda later called on students âto change the media narrative if they wanted to passâ. Yusuph further claimed that students were taught few practical skills during their five years of study and that they are allegedly used as labourers instead of being instructed by experienced farmers.\nRecounting his own experience as a student, Yusuph said they would be taken to the farm from 5am to 6pm and made to perform what he described as âuseless tasksâ without gaining experience, yield, or profit. He described the period as âa waste of timeâ.\nHe also alleged that their practical year was marked by abuse, restrictions on studentsâ movements, and forced labour.\nâStudents werenât allowed to leave the farm, even for water. A friend of mine, Fatimah, was slapped. We were also made to pay for bird feed despite school funds being allocated for it. Those who refused were threatened with an extra year.â\nYusuph said students were often punished arbitrarily and that Abanikanda sometimes instructed other lecturers to fail students who offended him, even if they werenât taking his course. âThe FPY (Farm Practical Year) is supposed to build studentsâ profiles, but many who participated still failed for no reason.â\nYusuph criticised the farm as a toxic learning environment: âHow can someone spend five years in a practical course and still not be employable? I only survived because I had prior experience. Some students leave without even a basic knowledge of farming.â\nDespite acres of farmland and assigned courses, he said there was no structured learning. âSkilled farmers should have been be hired, but he [Abanikanda allegedly] blocked that. Students were turned into carpenters, plumbers, and bricklayers instead of learning [farming]. Then they were punished unfairly,â he alleged as he spoke to University World News.\nYusuph said that suspension or compulsory leave for Abanikanda was not enough. âHe should either resign or be permanently sacked to serve as a deterrent. He was a threat to students. The atmosphere will improve if he leaves.\nThe need for professional conduct\nâStudents will feel safe and motivated. Iâd be happy to return and contribute, but for now, that environment is not safe.â\nHassan Soweto, coordinator of Nigeriaâs Education Rights Campaign, called Abanikandaâs alleged actions âunacceptable in higher educationâ. He said students are not children and cannot be subjected to such treatment.\nâIt violates their personal dignity as enshrined in the constitution. He has no authority to discipline students. If any student disobeys or violates the code of conduct, the matter should be reported through proper channels,â Soweto told University World News.\nHe stressed that allegations of misconduct must be handled through proper university procedures. âNo lecturer, regardless of rank, has the right to punish students. Likewise, students cannot punish staff.â\nSoweto urged students to continue using social media to demand accountability and advised Nigeriaâs Academic Staff Union of Universities to develop internal mechanisms to train its members on professional conduct: âLecturers and students are not enemies. Their relationship must be based on mutual respect. Accountability is essential, and social media now plays a key role in exposing misconduct.â\nThe dean responds\nAbanikanda, in response to questions, asked University World News to research how the FPY for Bachelor of Agriculture programmes is conducted in other universities and compare those practices with what is implemented at LASU, as well as with the guidelines mandated by the NUC.\nâThe students in question are 400-level students in their penultimate year, which is designated as the FPY. This programme is expected to run for 12 months, providing students with hands-on, experiential learning based on what they have been taught in class.\nâCheck other universities and ask about how the FPY is handled. We are currently in the planting season, and no one can control the weather. Nobody expected rain, sun, or anything that day, but we plant when we were supposed to plant, peg when we were supposed to peg, and harvest when itâs time to harvest,â he told University World News.\nWhen asked about a leaked audio recording in which he was allegedly heard threatening a student for sitting while asked to stand, he claimed the audio could have been edited to serve a particular agenda and declined to comment further on the issue.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI â Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse â An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Yet, as the global landscape of higher education rapidly evolves – driven by digital transformation, political polarisation and transnational student mobility – accreditation systems themselves face growing scrutiny.\nIn April, this debate reached a flashpoint in the United States when President Donald Trump issued an executive order radically reforming the country’s longstanding accreditation framework.\nThe shift immediately ignited urgent questions: What should accreditation authentically measure in a rapidly changing landscape?\nWho truly holds the authority to set its standards, and whose interests do those standards serve? And how profoundly do these decisions impact not only domestic higher education but also its global interconnectedness?\nThis dynamic tension between accountability and autonomy, and the shift from input-based to outcome-based assessment, forms a core driver of this critical debate.\nA distinctly American innovation\nAccreditation has long been a cornerstone of quality assurance, ensuring that institutions uphold established standards of academic integrity, governance and student outcomes.\nWhile informal mechanisms for evaluating educational quality have existed globally, the modern accreditation model – grounded in peer review and independent oversight – emerged in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nIn response to the rapid expansion of higher education, American colleges and universities established regional associations to develop shared evaluation criteria. This decentralised, voluntary system became a distinctly American innovation and ultimately influenced international practices.\nOver time, accreditation in the US has evolved into a powerful regulatory tool, particularly after it became linked to federal student aid. Despite being technically non-governmental, accrediting agencies gained substantial influence over institutional legitimacy and access to public funding.\nThe traditional model relies on peer-reviewed, cyclical processes of institutional self-assessment, external evaluation and periodic re-evaluation.\nWhile accrediting agencies operate independently, they must be recognised by the US Department of Education. Common criteria include institutional mission, academic governance, faculty qualifications, student support services and financial sustainability.\nWhile this model has been instrumental in maintaining academic standards and international credibility, it faces growing criticism for being bureaucratic and slow to adapt.\nInstitutions often encounter multi-year delays in securing approval for new programmes, particularly in emerging fields such as online education and digital credentials. For example, the rise of coding bootcamps and micro-credentials often outpaced traditional accreditation cycles, hindering innovation.\nAdditionally, its reliance on compliance-driven and input-focused metrics is increasingly seen as insufficiently responsive to modern demands for measurable outcomes.\nOne of the most contentious aspects has been the incorporation of social standards like diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\nWhile critics argue these extend beyond the technical scope of quality assurance and risk politicising academic governance, proponents contend that inclusive environments are integral to comprehensive educational quality and student success.\nGlobal accreditation frameworks\nAccreditation practices vary across the world, yet international models often strive for a balance between innovation, transparency and public accountability.\nUNESCO plays a key role in advancing quality assurance systems, particularly in the Global South, by promoting context-sensitive frameworks that are both inclusive and globally recognised.\nThese efforts prioritise equitable access to education and facilitate student mobility across borders. UNESCO’s regional frameworks – the Tokyo, Addis and Buenos Aires conventions – promote cross-border recognition and quality assurance in the Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean, respectively.\nIn the European Union, the Bologna Process and the European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance (ESG) have helped create a harmonised regional system.\nWhile institutions maintain autonomy, they must adhere to publicly accessible standards, undergo periodic evaluations, and follow stakeholder engagement protocols.\nCompared to the US system, the EU model is more centrally coordinated, often operating in alignment with national higher education policies. It prioritises evidence-based practices while fostering institutional diversity and innovation.\nThe European Qualifications Framework (EQF) serves as a reference framework for comparing qualifications across Europe by defining learning outcomes at different levels.\nWhile it does not directly accredit higher education institutions, it provides guidance to accreditation bodies and higher education institutions by aligning programmes with transparent, level-based outcomes that enhance quality assurance and facilitate cross-border recognition.\nDespite variations in structure and regulatory intensity, both UNESCO and the EU promote an accreditation model that enhances cross-border comparability and reinforces international trust.\nThese principles are increasingly at odds with the unilateral, market-orientated shift seen in recent US reforms, implicitly highlighting the distinctiveness and potential divergence of the US approach.\nThe 2025 Trump administration reform\nThe 2025 executive order issued by President Donald Trump signalled a significant shift away from the traditional accreditation philosophy of the US.\nFraming the existing model as ideologically biased and obstructive to innovation, the reform proposed a broad transition toward market-driven principles and performance-based outcomes.\nWhile framed as a move toward greater accountability and innovation, critics quickly noted that this emphasis on narrow financial metrics could inadvertently reshape the very purpose of higher education, potentially devaluing broader societal contributions.\nKey pillars of the reform included:\n• Emphasising measurable performance outcomes such as graduation rates, student loan repayment and post-graduation earnings.\n• Restricting accrediting agencies from imposing ideological mandates, particularly those related to DEI standards.\n• Expanding accreditation competition by recognising new accrediting bodies to challenge the domination of existing ones.\n• Prioritising student and taxpayer value over rigid procedural compliance.\nIn essence, the proposed reform reimagines accreditation as a performance-based contract between institutions and society, shifting the focus from peer consensus and regulatory tradition to market responsiveness and institutional autonomy.\nIdeological ‘neutrality’\nThe traditional accreditation model emphasises institutional mission, peer review and consensus-based evaluation, ensuring compliance with input-orientated criteria, such as curriculum design, faculty qualifications and governance structures.\nIn contrast, the reformist model shifts the focus towards performance metrics, student outcomes and market-driven competition.\nRather than prioritising institutional inputs, the reformist approach emphasises measurable results, including graduate earnings, employment rates and return on investment, aiming to enhance accountability and responsiveness to market demands.\nGovernance also differs sharply. The traditional model relies on a small group of well-established regional and national accreditors, whereas the reform encourages a competitive landscape with multiple bodies vying to certify institutions.\nThis shift from a peer-driven, collegial oversight model to one based on market competition raises questions about the long-term sustainability of quality assurance and the potential for declining standards as new accreditors seek market share.\nWhile traditional accreditation has increasingly incorporated social criteria such as diversity, equity and inclusion, the reform model asserts ideological neutrality as a guiding principle. This shift may streamline oversight, but it also introduces new political tensions under the guise of objectivity.\nHowever, the assertion of “ideological neutrality” itself is a contested concept in education, as it can inadvertently dismiss the inherent values in pedagogical approaches or the historical inequities that DEI initiatives aim to address.\nWhat is framed as neutral often reflects a specific, implicit set of ideological priorities.\nThe case of Columbia\nThis month, the US Department of Education notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), the accreditor of Columbia University, that the university was failing to meet federal accreditation standards due to its alleged “deliberate indifference” toward antisemitic harassment on campus.\nThis marked one of the most high-profile instances in which civil rights enforcement directly intersected with institutional accreditation.\nThe move signals a growing federal expectation that accrediting agencies go beyond academic evaluation to also ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination statutes. Traditionally, accreditors focused on academic quality, institutional governance and student outcomes.\nHowever, this case illustrates the evolving mandate for accreditors to uphold broader ethical and legal responsibilities – encompassing student safety, nondiscrimination and inclusive learning environments.\nThe Columbia case represents a significant moment in US higher education policy as it suggests that accreditation status may now hinge not only on educational performance but also on an institution’s capacity to respond to social and civil rights issues.\nThis development blurs the boundaries between traditional peer-reviewed quality assurance and direct federal enforcement, raising new questions about the appropriate role of accrediting bodies in overseeing institutional climate and campus governance.\nRisks of a market-based approach\nWhile a market-based accreditation model promises efficiency and innovation, it also introduces significant risks:\n• Quality control: The proliferation of accreditors without stringent oversight may weaken standards and enable predatory institutions, particularly in the for-profit sector.\nHistorical precedents of oversight failures in the for-profit higher education sector highlight the dangers of inadequate quality control when market incentives outweigh academic integrity.\n• Overreliance on narrow metrics: Prioritising financial outcomes in accreditation can marginalise disciplines such as the humanities, arts and public service, whose contributions are not easily monetised.\nThis risks skewing institutional priorities toward vocational training, potentially at the expense of developing critical thinking, civic engagement and broader societal contributions that are harder to quantify monetarily.\n• Equity concerns: Institutions serving under-represented populations may face penalties due to lower graduate earnings, even when these stem from systemic inequality rather than institutional shortcomings.\nThis creates a perverse incentive that could disproportionately harm institutions committed to access and social mobility, effectively penalising them for serving students who face greater systemic barriers.\n• Fragmentation and confusion: A competitive accreditation landscape could make it more difficult for students, employers and international partners to assess institutional legitimacy.\n• Global misalignment: The removal of DEI standards and weakened centralised oversight may cause US accreditation to diverge from global norms, potentially harming degree recognition and international student mobility.\nTowards a hybrid model\nRather than oscillating between bureaucratic rigidity and unchecked market forces, a hybrid model offers a more sustainable path forward. This approach would integrate:\n• Contextualised performance metrics: Combining employment data and loan repayment rates with qualitative indicators such as civic engagement, research output or student satisfaction.\nAchieving this balance would necessitate collaborative frameworks involving policymakers, educators and industry leaders to define and operationalise these diverse metrics effectively.\n• Streamlined regulatory processes: Accelerating the approval of innovative programmes while maintaining academic quality.\n• Rigorous oversight for new accreditors: Ensuring that newly recognised agencies adhere to clear, transparent standards of integrity and expertise.\n• Institutional pluralism without ideological barriers: Promoting diverse perspectives while ensuring academic freedom remains protected, free from restrictive ideological requirements.\n• Global compatibility: Maintaining alignment with international frameworks, such as UNESCO’s Global Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications, to facilitate mobility and mutual recognition.\nWhile promising, the implementation of such a hybrid model would undoubtedly face challenges, particularly in overcoming entrenched bureaucratic practices and bridging the ideological divides that currently characterise the accreditation debate.\nThis pluralistic, outcomes-informed model would preserve the strengths of traditional peer review while adapting to the demands of a rapidly evolving higher education landscape.\nImplications for international education\nThe proposed reforms could have unintended ripple effects on global education. Many countries – particularly those supported by the World Bank – have modelled their quality assurance systems on US accreditation norms.\nA shift toward deregulated, ideologically polarised accreditation may undermine mutual recognition agreements and weaken the global credibility of US degrees.\nAdditionally, the removal of DEI requirements could weaken the US’ reputation in international higher education, especially among partners who prioritise inclusive, equitable learning environments.\nIn an era where soft power and educational diplomacy play a crucial role, a fragmented and politically charged accreditation system risks diminishing the United States’ leadership in global higher education, as the lack of clear, consistent quality assurance signals can erode international confidence in US credentials and hinder academic partnerships.\nAccreditation in the digital and AI age\nThe future of accreditation depends on its ability to adapt to the transformations of the digital era. AI-powered instruction, micro-credentials and lifelong learning ecosystems require more flexible and responsive models of quality assurance.\nOrganisations like UNESCO and the EU are already advancing this agenda, promoting stackable credentials, blockchain-verifiable transcripts and interoperability across platforms.\nTo remain relevant, accrediting agencies must move beyond static, cyclical evaluations and embrace real-time, data-informed monitoring tools, potentially leveraging AI to analyse vast datasets on student progress and institutional performance.\nHowever, they must also navigate the ethical and pedagogical implications of AI-driven learning, ensuring that new credentialing models are fair, transparent and internationally comparable.\nAny viable future system must prioritise fairness, adaptability and international comparability to ensure global recognition and credibility.\nThoughtful reform\nAccreditation remains essential to maintaining trust and quality in higher education. While the United States’ traditional model has been historically influential, it now faces significant challenges in adapting to innovation, equity and global coordination.\nThe proposed reforms offer a sharp critique of bureaucracy and ideological overreach, yet their market-first orientation also introduces substantial risks.\nA more promising future lies in a hybrid approach – one that integrates outcome-based assessment with transparent governance, academic integrity and global interoperability.\nAs higher education enters the digital and AI age, accreditation must evolve not through deregulation alone but through thoughtful reform anchored in public accountability, social purpose and international cooperation.\nFuture research should explore the practical implementation challenges of a hybrid accreditation model, particularly how to establish universally accepted qualitative metrics for educational quality and how to effectively integrate emerging digital credentials into existing international recognition frameworks without compromising integrity.\nMin Bahadur Bista is a former professor of education at Tribhuvan University and a former education specialist with UNESCO, having served in various countries across the Asia-Pacific region.

But we need to ask several key questions, even if easy answers are not always available.\nSome, like Harvey Charles and Anthony Ogden, call for optimism about the future of internationalisation; others, like John Hudzik, suggest fighting for it. All claim the importance of global engagement and collaboration, for instance, Jason Lane.\nAnd while Riyad Shahjahan and Simon Marginson state that “the ‘nation-state ontology’ acts as the invisible framework underpinning internationalisation” and call for an internationalisation beyond the nation-state and its borders, Futao Huang, Wen Wen and Qian Xiao call for a fundamental transformation of internationalisation: “it must now be strategic, aligning closely with national priorities while embracing global responsibilities.”\nMeanwhile, Julio Labraña and Paulina Latorre call for “a new grammar of internationalisation, one that is not nostalgic for sovereignty but alert to the complex, contingent and differentiated conditions under which universities and their internal and external actors must survive today”.\nThe value of international students\nSimilar to these calls for a reaction to what I have referred to as the “undoing of internationalisation”, there is also an active debate about the pros and cons of international students.\nIn response to the Trump administration’s attack on them as well as those by other governments, David Bell, professor of history at Princeton, said in The New York Times on 1 June that “by some measures, the opening of American higher education to international students is an obvious, unqualified good. By others, it is much more problematic”.\nHe continues by stating that “in the case of Chinese students in Ohio, foreign students tend to come from considerable wealth and privilege … so these students make US universities look even more elite and possibly out of touch”. And he calls for balancing “their increase with more outreach to a larger range of domestic applicants”.\nHe and other authors make reference to the important contribution that international students make to the national economy, but Jenna Mittelmeier of the University of Manchester says on LinkedIn that she feels “uncomfortable when these kinds of posts make the rounds, reducing international students solely to their monetary value”.\nShe writes: “It is a dehumanising language which assumes that a person’s right to be geographically mobile is inherently tied to their economic contribution upon arrival. But what we are talking about isn’t numbers, it’s people. Humans.”\nThis is a point made by others as well, who address the important contributions international students make to the personal and professional development of local students, and to the local community.\nThree sets of questions\nThese are all interesting and relevant observations and discussions, but it leaves me with several concerns and questions.\nShahjahan and Marginson correctly ask the fundamental question: “What do we mean when we say ‘international’ or ‘internationalisation’? What worldviews underpin these concepts?” Their answer is simple: “Reimagine it: not as a tool for national advantage but as a commitment to shared futures. What kind of world are we building through education – and for whom?”\nThat’s fine, but does that really bring us clarity?\nThree sets of questions come to my mind in reading these articles, including my own contributions and those with my colleagues at the Center for International Higher Education recently.\nFirst, are all these calls for action and conceptual change really new and only necessary because of what has happened in the past months? Was the dominant position of the United States in international higher education not already declining, as well as that of other leading countries in the Global North?\nWere global engagement and collaboration not already essential and a key driver for internationalisation? Did other serious threats to global collaboration, such as inequality, brain drain, national security and the lack of attention to the Sustainable Development Goals not already exist?\nDid we not call for a socially responsible internationalisation in Europe, before the current pressure in the United States? And did Australia not demand a politically responsible internationalisation, focused on national security and the screening of international students and scholars?\nHave there not already been many earlier calls to shift the focus from international mobility and competition to internationalising the curriculum and collaboration? In other words, are we only calling for this transformation because of Trump and his fellow populists, or are there more fundamental and underlying reasons to do so?\nSecondly, is there indeed a real tension between national and international? Between revenue generation and the international student as a human being? Are international students only part of a wealthy elite going to elite universities, as David Bell suggests, or are most of them aspiring and motivated students from middle-income families going to a diverse range of universities?\nAnd is there a tension between competition and collaboration? The answer depends on the context, who you are asking and what you want to get out of it. But we need to ask ourselves these questions constantly, even if the answers are complex.\nAnd thirdly, when we ask ourselves, “What do we mean by internationalisation?”, is there really one answer to that question? As I and others have advocated, there is not one model of internationalisation that fits all. It is context and stakeholder related and changes over time.\nWe must continually ask ourselves what we are talking about when we use the word ‘internationalisation’. What do we mean by ‘a new grammar’ or by ‘a commitment to shared futures’? Calling for it is fine, but define it more clearly and go for it.\nKeep asking questions\nOver the years, I have had many discussions with colleagues about the need to have a better word than ‘internationalisation’ to describe that to which we all aspire. ‘Interculturalisation’, ‘global engagement’, ‘global learning’ and other terms have been mentioned, but, like ‘internationalisation’, there are always limitations and a lack of clarity.\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to change a term that has become so strongly embedded in higher education over the past five decades.\nLet’s at least do our best to be clear about what we mean when using the word, and keep asking ourselves questions about its meanings, even if we do not have clear answers. As such, the current wave of articles, suggestions and perceptions on the future of internationalisation can only be welcome, even if the answers are still blowing in the wind!\nHans de Wit is professor emeritus and distinguished fellow at the Boston College Center of International Higher Education (CIHE), United States.

On the one hand, it provides an opportunity for self-realisation, creating new knowledge, influencing society and shaping the future. On the other, it is subject to high demands, constant pressure, uncertainty and the need to balance numerous roles.\nFrom the perspective of a rector, I must emphasise that a balance must be found among this tension that ensures both the professional growth of academic staff and the sustainability of the university.\nAt the annual conference of the European University Association (EUA), which the University of Latvia was honoured to host in Riga this year, we highlighted five essential components that help create a balanced, motivating and equitable career environment at university.\nThese components are not merely theoretical recommendations – they are clearly supported in the association’s report of 2025, which emphasises the need for a structured, inclusive and thoughtful approach to building academic careers.\nOne of the cornerstones that make an academic career attractive is a clear and supportive professional development path. In addition to opportunities to grow academically – to develop research and prepare publications and to lead projects – it talks about the need to recognise accomplishments.\nWe must create a culture in which excellence is recognised and appreciated not only through bibliometric indicators, but also through pedagogical work, outreach to society and international collaboration, and achieving excellence in at least one of these areas.\nThe EUA calls it “responsible research assessment”, meaning a multidimensional assessment that recognises different types of contributions. At least one of these dimensions must be at the level of distinction, and we must provide the means for cultivating and advancing its development.\nThe university should provide individualised career opportunities – not only traditional academic career paths, but also alternative career directions, appreciating different types of contribution. It is evident that in many parts of Europe there is a lack of clear intermediate stages between doctoral studies and the beginning of an academic career path which hinders the development of sustainable careers.\nWe need to give teaching staff who work excellently with students the opportunity to advance in their careers even if their research is not as intensive in comparison with others, whereas excellent researchers should be able to grow rapidly if they make a significant contribution to their field.\nThis flexibility is the basis for fairness in academia. Furthermore, there should be the possibility for academics to take time out, putting their career on hold while gaining experience in the fields of practice or business.\nClear growth trajectory\nThe university must also be able to offer young researchers – doctoral students and those in postdoctoral positions – a clear growth trajectory. Currently, the early stages of an academic career frequently depend on project-based funding, which creates instability at the very stage of life when young scientists are building a family, a home and their professional identity.\nAnalysis of the current situation shows that the prevalence of short-term contracts and insufficiently clear career transitions is a widespread problem. If we want to retain these people at universities, there must be a well-thought-out early career support system encompassing financial support, mentoring and networking.\nMoreover, academic careers cannot develop in a vacuum – they require collaboration both within the university, as well as at national and international levels. We must create an environment where researchers, teaching staff and students are all connected with a view to achieving a shared goal – to create, teach and inspire.\nWe need to create structured networks of cooperation to promote mobility and knowledge exchange, especially between less well-endowed and larger institutions. It is the task of the university to support the formation of this community – providing platforms for collaboration, opportunities to travel, participate in conferences and attract funding for joint projects.\nAnother key issue is public engagement. A modern university cannot exist in isolation from society. Researchers must become opinion leaders who help society navigate complex issues – from artificial intelligence, climate change and religious coexistence and peace to important complicated practical everyday matters, such as family budgeting in the modern world.\nAt the same time, they must be able to clearly and convincingly demonstrate how the university uses public resources for the benefit of society.\nThe third mission – outreach to society – has become an integral part of an academic career, which must be supported in a structured and long-term manner. Here we see in action one of the important aspects of academic excellence – the ability to transfer complex knowledge to the general public.\nThe need for courage\nHowever, despite these principles, significant systemic contradictions still exist. The EUA report highlights that some groups may have a competitive advantage in the academic environment in many parts of Europe.\nUniversities must promote structural fairness, equal access to opportunities and gender balance in senior positions. Demands on academics are increasing, and so is the lack of security.\nCompetition is growing more intense, while the rewards often fail to match the investment of time and energy. Bureaucratic burdens have also become heavier and the time for creative work is shrinking. The academic environment is becoming more demanding, yet frequently less appreciative of the efforts put in.\nIn this situation, universities must have courage. The courage to offer different career paths. The courage to create personnel policies based on fairness, diversity and trust. The courage to defend fundamental science at a time when society demands quick and measurable results. The courage to talk to policy-makers about the need to invest in academic careers as the basis for the country’s long-term development.\nAnd finally, universities must have the courage to care for people. For the young researcher who is still trying to understand whether this environment is for her. For the lecturer who has been passing on knowledge to students for years and is often left in the shadows. For the scientist who wants to think boldly and do so with academic freedom.\nIf we can have that courage – we will also be able to shape a university where a career is not only possible, but also sustainable and inspiring.\nThis is my call – to universities, to politicians, to society. An academic career is not just a profession. It is the foundation of society’s future. Let us take care of it together – with clear structure, fairness and courage!\nSystemic change\nFor these changes to be more than slogans and become systemic, we need not only internal commitment from universities but also the support of national policies. We see that, in parallel with institutional efforts, a coordinated, intergovernmental policy must be developed that ensures funding stability, mobility opportunities and career coherence across Europe.\nCurrently, too many young scientists find themselves in a ‘career vacuum’, where there is no clear, structured next stage after the doctoral or postdoctoral period. This is a loss for both the individual and their country.\nMoreover, we need to recognise that sustainable academic careers are not just an institutional or structural problem, they are also a cultural issue. We must change the idea of the ‘academic hero’ – no one is ceaselessly productive, invariably available and always self-motivated.\nWe only shape the future if we also acknowledge that we are all human – we get tired, things happen, we need support. Fairness and sustainability begin when we allow different personalities to grow at their own pace and still be part of a common goal.\nThat is why we need courageous solidarity – across institutions, generations, sectors and countries. Only then will we be able to build a European academic space where a career is an opportunity, not a risk.\nGundars Berzins is rector of the University of Latvia (UL) and a professor and leading researcher who holds a doctorate in management science.

Since August 2020, the organisation has been publishing annual reports on the state of Belarusian academia.\nThis March, a new edition of the report was released, covering events that took place between January and December 2024, with some exceptions (for instance, events that took place in the lead-up to the 2025 presidential elections in Belarus).\nIt includes the following topics: politically motivated prosecution of students and faculty members as well as organisations engaged in activities related to education and academia; growing ideological control and militarisation of Belarusian education; the situation regarding mandatory job placement; and the situation for Belarusian students abroad.\nSeveral examples deserve to be mentioned in relation to these, while more details (those known to the BSA) can be found in the report.\nPersecution of students and faculty\nFirst, in 2024 students and faculty in universities continued to face persecution for any form of criticism or dissent against the authorities, with most of the cases taken out being connected to past actions in the aftermath of the 2020 protests or the full-scale war in Ukraine.\nFor example, a fifth-year university student was sentenced in Minsk under an article of the Criminal Code for her involvement in protests in 2020. Several students from the Belarusian National Technical University were allegedly detained for “collaboration with Ukrainian intelligence services” and labelled a “terrorist cell” while being paraded on television.\nAnother case involves a lecturer at the State University of Hrodna who was on trial under a criminal article for financing “extremist” activities. This is what human rights organisations, NGOs and independent media are called by the authorities.\nSecond, ideological pressure on universities is stronger than ever. One recent development is court trials under political charges conducted within university premises in front of students. Sometimes such hearings are accompanied by lectures for students about their legal responsibility, including in relation to so-called “extremist” offences.\nThe Belarusian academic community also faced challenges before the 2024 parliamentary “elections”. So-called “open dialogues” were held with students, focusing on “patriotic education for young people”. At the same time, these events were used to warn them of the consequences of involvement in “extremist and terrorist activities”.\nAnother trend in 2024 was cases where Belarusian students were transported to Russian-occupied territories in Ukraine to participate in various events. This is in line with the Belarusian authorities’ political, logistical and technical support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, despite minor differences in their visions for a potential ceasefire.\nNext, Belarus is the only European country where all students whose studies are state funded are assigned their first job by universities, often with barely any transparency in the process. It is possible to opt out, but that requires repaying the costs of students’ education plus additional fees.\nIn 2023 and 2024, Belarusian authoritarian leader Alyaksandr Lukashenka and Minister of Education Andrey Ivanets repeatedly declared the necessity to extend this system to include fee-paying students as well. For now, this idea remains a consideration for the future.\nNevertheless, Ivanets has proposed a significant increase in the financial compensation that young people must pay to the state if they refuse to fulfil their job placement after completing state-funded education.\nBelarusian students abroad\nOne chapter of the BSA’s report is dedicated to Belarusian students abroad. In the 2023-24 academic year around 18,000 Belarusians were studying at European universities (mostly in Poland).\nFirst of all, Belarusian nationals still can’t renew their passports in consular offices abroad; they can only do it within the country. This leads to bureaucratic difficulties as those students who can’t return to Belarus for safety reasons have to find a way to continue their studies and legal stay before their documents expire.\nOften they rely on so-called ‘travel documents’ issued by European countries. However, it’s not always possible to get them: the BSA specifically mentions a Norwegian case which resulted in several rejections.\nMoreover, in their attempts to halt the brain drain Belarusian authorities have created additional obstacles for young people who want to study abroad. They include complicated procedures for obtaining apostille (an official certificate that verifies the authenticity of a public document) and problems with issuing certificates that detail the programme studied by the applicant at secondary school.\nAmong other challenges are visa rejections and difficulties regarding diploma recognition in Poland, payment delays faced by those supported by specific scholarship programmes, admission restrictions in Lithuania, etc.\nCall for support\nWhat can be done to support the Belarusian academic community and youth activists?\nFirst and foremost – we need to spread the word to raise awareness.

The authors frame it at the heart of collective well-being that flies in the face of the current trends of isolationism. I couldn’t agree more.\nFor global learners, activating interdependence requires one to be aware of oneself and one’s connections across various geopolitical and sociocultural contexts. One might define this learning outcome as emergent global critical consciousness, which is a mindset that crosses geographies and borders of all kinds, ultimately aiding learners to navigate difference.\nIt also allows learners to articulate, recognise and give meaning to the individual as much as the collective, an imperative in global mindedness.\nThe term critical consciousness comes from Paulo Freire, who uses the concept to advocate for forms of active education that make a difference in the world, particularly by challenging systemic inequalities.\nGlobal learners can become influential agents of change, by acquiring skills to dig deep into the various internal and external points of interdependence that may or may not be visible to them. And, once that deep social and political infrastructure is laid bare, then and only then can learners transform their awareness into action. This act can produce new collective geographies that chip away at isolationism.\nA global sense of responsibility\nWe know that global learning is not just about knowledge, skills and dispositions but rather about taking action on the knowledge, skills and dispositions obtained through the process of learning.\nThe ability to take action, clearly an essential piece of global learning, as Landorf and Regulska affirm, rests with the development of a global critical consciousness, which requires learners to embody interdependence.\nInterdependence is also aligned to a broader sense of responsibility. For example, when one’s identity is built conceptually as global, as an interdependence of people, places, phenomena and politics, then learners are able to expand their senses of responsibility. In a way, it makes them care more.\nLearners can make the leap to no longer simply imagining their scopes of commitment being aligned to a limited, usually localised, geography. Rather, learners can activate a global sense of responsibility, which, as Doreen Massey argued in 2004, is ultimately sustained by a learned global critical consciousness.\nAgain, responsibility is predictably aligned with one’s identity, and identity is often formed around geographically bounded territories, whether a community, a region or a state. Therefore, taking action beyond what is typically a local sense of responsibility, starting to care about others around the world or even across a city block or town, requires learners to recognise the connections around them as giving meaning to themselves.\nUltimately, it comes down to identity and seeing one’s identity as not isolated but as interdependent. It is about seeing ourselves and our lives as unapologetically global.\nWe should demand this global sense of responsibility, now more than ever. This requires learners to dig into their sense of self and, ultimately, all subject matter to articulate the connections that give it meaning.\nPacific Studies\nWhen critically conscious across geographies, students can toggle back and forth between the local and the global, the particular and the general, the individual and the collective, their own biases and concepts that frame others’ perspectives. They can chip away at tired binaries and question the dominant messaging that distracts us more and more from the geographic collective.\nPacific Studies is a case in point.\nPacific Studies is a field of study that explicitly emerged as a critical response to the problematic histories of colonisation, cultural collection and resource extraction that had defined (and often still do define) the Pacific islands as an empty space between major geopolitical territories.\nIn his renowned essay, “Our Sea of Islands”, the writer and anthropologist Epeli Hau’ofa outlines how Pacific and Oceania Studies reverses the misappropriated representations that academically, economically and politically define the Pacific as being made of isolated and disempowered islands in a far sea.\nRather, Hau’ofa proposes an alternative geographic vision of the Pacific as a sea of many islands, where both roots and routes are integral to one’s identity and where one is politically positioned in the world.\nTo Epeli Hau’ofa and other Pacific Studies scholars, the sea is not an empty space between islands and other landmasses but is equally part of what gives islands and other topographies meaning.\nPacific Studies reverses the conceptual underpinning of Oceania, and the Pacific Islands and Islanders, as marginalised and as merely in-between the geopolitical powers of Australia, Asia and the Americas. Instead, the multitude of islands envisioned through Pacific Studies undoes the geographic rendering of agency, and lack thereof, and creates a new geography in response.\nPacific Studies is thus not just a form of scholarship but is also pursuing a form of global critical consciousness where the geographic manifestations of local and global are recreated.\nSimilarly, in this reframed geography of the Pacific, identities, cultures and rituals are not only rooted to the land but also to the waterways and routes that connect them to others far away. The connections between the islands matter as much to a sense of identity as the islands themselves.\nGlobal educators focus on the islands, yes, but they also ask learners to consider what connects the islands to others around the world. So, while global learners understand the ‘micro’ rootedness of identities, culture, ethnicity and politics, they are also aware that these representations of the world are created by ‘macro’ routes that circumnavigate islands and oceans.\nGlobal learning\nToday, in a world where performed and political boundaries are hardening, we need new geographies. We need learners to easily cross boundaries and embody our interdependence. We need to challenge the mappings of our world(s) that are increasingly becoming siloed and singular. We need global learning.\nGlobal learning helps students dig deep into the complexity of subject matter and into themselves. It allows learners to critically self-reflect such that they can recognise their interdependence of roots and routes.\nGlobal learners see deeply into common categories or dichotomies that harmfully simplify the worldviews of too many. Global learners acquire broader senses of responsibility and commitment that span from the local across the global.\nNever have we needed global learning more. We now need learners to acquire these skills so they can push against the tide of isolationism and challenge the rigid identities that are tenaciously ‘locked’ to geographic borders.\nNow more than ever we need to dig beyond those dominant representations and recognise their flimsiness rather than their fortitude. This is why higher education and the world need global learning, so we can tend to our local islands and our shared oceans, both of which are necessary to counter toxic geographies of separation for generations to come.\nHilary E Kahn is vice provost of international affairs and associate professor of anthropology at Indiana University Indianapolis.

Stronger graduate outcomes, more sustainable pipelines and eventually a more resilient global brand will result from this.\nWorking in the international higher education recruitment field and with students and institutions all over the world, I have seen how powerful strong outreach can be.\nBut we’ve also seen the gap getting bigger between what students expect after they show interest in an institution and what they often get.\nIt’s not just about being seen anymore; the new frontier of international recruitment is about building real trust and providing support from the first inquiry and all the way through.\nThe choice economy\nToday’s international students are smart, well-informed and in charge of their own lives. According to a survey by ICEF Monitor, 56% of prospective international students begin researching study-abroad options less than six months before applying, and over 60% expect a response within 24 hours.\nMany of them don’t just apply to one or two institutions; they apply to four or more. And even though a timely offer is still important, what happens after the offer is becoming more and more important in deciding whether a student will choose you.\nStudents have told us directly: “I got the offer, but I didn’t know what to do next.” If they lack information on what to do, they just need to pick different institutions that provide more information and support to them.\nIn this “choice economy”, what students crave is connection. They want an institution that sees them as more than just a student ID; one that answers their questions, listens to their worries and helps them feel good about their choice.\nThe process of enrolling is emotional, and institutions that understand this human element will have a competitive edge.\nFrom our conversations with prospective students and their families, 80% of them see policy certainty as being as important as academic quality when they choose where to study.\nStudents trust the value of a degree, and genuine pathways to graduate employment are huge factors for them to decide which institution or country to go to.\nRecruitment is just the beginning\nConversion success isn’t purely about working harder; it’s about working smarter and with\nempathy.\nHere are three changes I believe will make student support better.\nAccording to a QS insight article, conversion rates from enquiry to enrolment can be as low as 1% in a highly competitive market, so when it comes to international recruitment, innovation isn’t just about new technologies. It’s also about making real, lasting connections that lead to enrolment.\nWhen we focus on making connections first, we help students feel more connected to a university’s culture through real-time interactions and real stories.\nFor instance, livestreaming lets prospective students talk directly with university staff about everything from academic programmes to getting a visa.\nThese sessions are often co-branded, strengthening institutional partnerships and enhancing trust.\nAccording to a QS report, 49% of students looking to study in the UK said the ability to ask questions of existing international students was useful when making study decisions, so similarly, launching a podcast featuring authentic stories from students, alumni and experts that bring universities’ values and successes to life.\nThe path from inquiry to enrolment, in my opinion, should use live interactions along with data-driven insights to improve application conversion.\nInstitutions can reduce uncertainty and increase commitment by providing individualised support at the appropriate times by knowing where students drop out in the process.\nOn the other hand, smart matching has been much discussed in the industry. It uses AI to screen applicants and offer tailored programme recommendations and is crucial in this AI era.\nIt increases the likelihood of successful enrolment and long-term satisfaction by prioritising high-potential candidates and ensuring that students are directed to the best fit for their goals and profiles.\nCombined, these strategies can help the industry achieve better conversion rates, reduce administrative burdens and build resilience amid tightening budgets.\nThe future of international recruitment belongs to those who can combine technology with human-centred engagement, turning applications into lifelong students.\nThe time has come for institutions and the recruitment sector to transform their recruitment processes into integrated support systems. If we want the leaders of tomorrow to choose us, we need to invest in human connections and digital tools today.\nChristina Ke is the UK managing director of education consultancy company Uoffer Global.\nThis article is a commentary.

By 2024, this number reached a historic milestone of 88 scholars in a single cohort, making Illinois one of the leading host institutions for the programme.\nIn total, Illinois now hosts the largest Bolashak cohort in its history, with scholars coming from 42 institutions across Kazakhstan, including 29 universities, six research institutes and various government ministries.\nThis broad representation highlights the programme’s national scope and its ability to identify and support talent from diverse sectors within Kazakhstan.\nThe University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has earned its status as a leading destination for Bolashak scholars through a combination of tailored support, academic collaboration and robust professional development initiatives.\nGET staff work closely with various academic units across campus to provide individualised support to Bolashak scholars, matching them with faculty mentors from fields as diverse as law, environmental ecology, data science and higher education innovation trends.\nThis mentorship system not only enhances the scholars’ academic experience but also opens up avenues for personalised research opportunities.\nBolashak scholars participate in a range of activities designed to enrich their academic and professional experiences.\nFor example, scholars are involved in course audits, seminars and research development workshops to deepen their understanding of subjects related to their fields.\nIn partnership with the Centre for Innovation in Teaching & Learning, Bolashak scholars also have access to pedagogical training that enhances their teaching and research skills.\nIt is worth noting that many Bolashak scholars, as part of their 12-month research projects, have reported that their research articles have been submitted or even accepted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.\nKazakhstani universities are particularly focused on increasing the number of articles published in Scopus-indexed journals in order to meet the key performance indicators set forth in the Concept for the Development of Higher Education and Science in the Republic of Kazakhstan for 2023 to 2029.\nPublishing in Scopus-indexed journals remains a significant challenge for researchers and faculty members across higher education institutions in Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkmenistan.\nCross-cultural understanding\nIn addition to the academic benefits, the cultural exchange aspect of the Bolashak Programme is vital. At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Bolashak scholars engage in a variety of cultural exchange activities that not only help them share Kazakhstan’s rich cultural heritage but also expose them to different cultural perspectives.\nEvents like the “Intercultural Spotlight on Kazakhstan” and the “Travel around the World” programme allow scholars to showcase Kazakh culture while learning about global traditions and practices.\nMoreover, the QazTalk Kazakh Language Speaking Club initiated by the Russian, East European and Eurasian Center provides an informal yet valuable platform for Bolashak scholars to teach and interact with other students and faculty members on campus interested in Kazakh culture and language.\nThis type of cultural exchange fosters mutual understanding and promotes the development of cross-cultural communication skills, which are increasingly crucial in today’s interconnected world.\nBolashak scholars return home not only with academic credentials but also with hands-on research experience, international networks and a global perspective that will allow them to address pressing national challenges.\nThe growing network of Bolashak alumni plays a crucial role in fostering ongoing collaboration between Kazakhstan and global academic institutions.\nThese alumni serve as ambassadors, fostering partnerships, research collaborations and knowledge exchange that amplify the impact of the programme well beyond the scholars themselves.\nShynar Imangaliyeva is programme coordinator for global education and training at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, USA.\nThis article is a commentary.

It envisioned education as a transformative force, cultivating critical consciousness, empathy and a sense of belonging to humanity.\nGCED positioned learners not merely as national citizens, but as active participants in an interconnected world, capable of addressing complex global issues.\nThis vision gained renewed momentum when GCED was formally incorporated into Sustainable Development Goal 4.7 in 2015, amid growing optimism about globalisation, expanding digital connectivity and revitalised multilateral cooperation.\nAt that historical moment, GCED seemed not only timely but essential – a framework through which education could prepare individuals to engage with pressing global challenges, such as climate change, inequality and violent conflict, with a shared sense of purpose and responsibility.\nShocks to the system\nThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed deep fractures in the international order, as vaccine nationalism, politicised science and xenophobic rhetoric undermined global solidarity. Far from fostering unity, the pandemic intensified divisions and magnified existing inequalities, particularly along racial, economic and geopolitical lines.\nSimultaneously, neonationalist movements gained traction across multiple regions, promoting sovereignty, cultural purity and protectionist policies over global cooperation. These movements often framed transnational educational efforts as subversive, positioning GCED as incompatible with national loyalty.\nEducation became a new ideological battleground, with GCED increasingly portrayed as a threat to national identity and cultural autonomy. Critics questioned whether global citizenship promotes cultural homogenisation, erodes traditional values or imposes Western liberal norms – challenging GCED’s legitimacy in societies where public discourse is increasingly polarised and global engagement is viewed with suspicion.\nA paradoxical space\nGCED now occupies a paradoxical space: it is more urgently needed than ever, yet its legitimacy is increasingly contested.\nThe escalating complexity of global challenges – climate disruption, digital disinformation, pandemics and rising authoritarianism – underscores the need for education that fosters critical consciousness, intercultural understanding and a sense of shared responsibility across borders. GCED’s foundational vision remains vital to any effort aimed at addressing transnational crises in an ethical and sustainable way.\nYet the sociopolitical context in which GCED operates has shifted dramatically. In many countries even core principles such as human rights, diversity and environmental responsibility have become entangled in ideological battles. GCED is often criticised for promoting ‘globalist’ agendas seen to conflict with national values, sovereignty or cultural identity.\nThis backlash is particularly acute in higher education, where institutions are increasingly drawn into debates over curriculum, identity politics and academic freedom. Faculty implementing GCED may encounter institutional resistance, political scrutiny and constraints on funding, especially where global engagement is equated with cultural erasure or liberal bias.\nThese ideological tensions are not merely theoretical. In many parts of the world, GCED has become a flashpoint in public debates over national identity, educational sovereignty and cultural values. Two recent cases illustrate how GCED programmes can be challenged in contested environments.\nIndia’s nationalistic priorities\nIn India, the government’s increasing emphasis on ‘Indianising’ education has led to a cautious retreat from global citizenship themes. Under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, while global competencies are nominally encouraged, critical GCED content – such as secular ethics, postcolonial critique or transnational solidarity – has been marginalised in favour of national heritage and cultural revivalism.\nSchools piloting GCED modules through international partnerships (for example, UNESCO-APCEIU’s Global Citizenship initiatives) have encountered implicit pressure to conform to nationalistic priorities, with some educators reporting institutional hesitancy when it comes to addressing contentious global issues, such as religious freedom or gender equity.\nThe shift reflects a broader ideological climate in which GCED is reframed as a potential threat to national cohesion.\nCultural battles in the US\nIn the United States, GCED has increasingly been swept into polarised cultural battles over ‘woke’ education and internationalism.\nIn states such as Florida and Texas, classroom content that addresses global perspectives, climate justice or United Nations goals has come under legislative and parental scrutiny. Several school districts have curtailed participation in Model UN programmes or restricted access to teaching materials on global human rights, citing concerns about political bias.\nEducators attempting to teach critical global issues often face backlash, with some encountering administrative restrictions or fears of reprisal under new curriculum transparency laws. In this context, GCED’s core principles – such as empathy, critical thinking and transnational awareness – are being recast as ideological rather than educational.\nFurther complicating this environment is the rise of digital nationalism and online echo chambers, which accelerate polarisation and undermine the conditions necessary for thoughtful intercultural dialogue.\nIn this context, GCED must confront not only external criticism but also internal fragmentation over its aims and methods. The challenge now is not to defend GCED in abstract terms, but to reconceive it as a flexible, locally grounded and ethically resilient framework, capable of navigating contested terrains while remaining anchored to its moral core.\nDistinct strands\nFaced with mounting political pressures and ideological contestation, GCED has evolved into distinct strands, each reflecting different interpretations of its purpose. One approach, often referred to as critical GCED, foregrounds issues of power, inequality and systemic injustice. It encourages students to interrogate dominant narratives and engage in transformative action.\nA second strand, sometimes labelled soft GCED, emphasises universal values such as intercultural understanding and mutual respect, but deliberately avoids direct engagement with contentious political issues to maintain broader appeal.\nA third variant, instrumental GCED, reframes global competencies in terms of employability and economic competitiveness, aligning GCED with workforce development agendas and, in doing so, depoliticising its original moral vision.\nThese variations reflect both strategic adaptations and deep ideological tensions within the GCED movement itself. Fundamental questions remain unresolved: Should GCED primarily cultivate global moral responsibility or prepare students for participation in a global labour market? Should it prioritise critical consciousness that challenges systemic injustices, or emphasise social cohesion in increasingly polarised societies?\nIn the current climate, these debates are not merely theoretical; they determine whether GCED is accepted, diluted or rejected outright across different educational and political contexts.\nChallenges to GCED\nThe future of GCED is shaped by several interrelated challenges that test its coherence, legitimacy and adaptability.\nFirst, ideological instrumentalisation poses a significant risk. GCED initiatives are increasingly susceptible to co-optation – whether by progressive activism emphasising global justice, or by neoliberal frameworks that reduce education to an economic tool – thus fracturing its appeal across political divides.\nSecond, the tension between cultural sensitivity and universalism remains unresolved. Advocating for universal human rights while respecting diverse cultural traditions requires a careful balancing act that GCED has yet to fully master.\nThird, the fragmentation of global norms has weakened the international consensus that originally underpinned GCED’s legitimacy. As multilateral institutions lose authority and geopolitical rivalry intensifies, GCED cannot rely solely on top-down frameworks; it must cultivate legitimacy through engagement with diverse local contexts.\nFinally, the dynamics of digital polarisation have amplified ideological echo chambers, making the cultivation of critical media literacy and intercultural dialogue both more urgent and more difficult. As misinformation spreads rapidly and digital publics become increasingly divided, the core aims of GCED – critical thinking, empathy and global solidarity – face unprecedented obstacles.\nEmbrace of pluralism\nFor GCED to thrive in an era of heightened polarisation, it must undergo both reaffirmation and reinvention. First, GCED must reaffirm its foundational commitments to justice, empathy and planetary responsibility. In an age of technocratic dilution and ideological capture, it is critical that GCED remain, at its core, a moral project, calling individuals to recognise their interconnectedness and mutual obligations across human and ecological boundaries.\nAt the same time, GCED must be reimagined through a lens of plurality rather than homogeneity. Rather than advancing a singular, universalised model of the ‘global citizen’, it must cultivate diverse pathways to global consciousness, grounded in varied cultural, historical and political traditions. Embracing pluralism strengthens GCED’s relevance and guards against perceptions of cultural imperialism.\nFurthermore, GCED must adopt new strategies for engagement in polarised environments. Dialogue across ideological divides must shift from being an ancillary goal to a central pedagogical task. Educational practices that intentionally cultivate skills of active listening, civil disagreement, empathy toward opposing perspectives and critical self-reflection will be crucial to preparing learners for democratic engagement in divided societies.\nFinally, GCED must be rooted in a model of local-global reciprocity. Global citizenship cannot be abstracted from local responsibility. Anchoring global issues within local realities – while empowering learners to take meaningful action within their own communities – can rebuild GCED’s credibility and demonstrate that global solidarity begins with everyday, situated acts of care and justice.\nGCED’s transformative promise\nA decade after its optimistic incorporation into the Sustainable Development Goals, GCED stands at a critical juncture. Confronted by pandemic-induced uncertainty, neonationalist resurgence and the fragmentation of global norms, it faces both intensified necessity and intensified resistance.\nThe future of GCED will not be determined by international declarations alone but by how educators, communities and learners navigate the complex tensions of our time – holding fast to the hope of shared humanity, even as the world fractures around them.\nIf GCED can embrace complexity, foster resilience and adapt creatively while remaining anchored to its ethical core, it may yet fulfil its transformative promise. In a world increasingly defined by division, the task of nurturing global citizens is not only more urgent but, indeed, more radical than ever before.\nJames Yoonil Auh is the chair of computing and communications engineering at KyungHee Cyber University in South Korea.

It emphasises that someone’s sense of self and identity is deeply rooted in their relationships with others and their contribution to the collective well-being of the community.\nInnovations that align with the continent’s diversity\nSubsequently, the education provided in a reimagined African university should incorporate innovations that align with the continent’s rich diversity of peoples, environment and cultures.\nHighlighting issues in learning, Kitawi and Wachira said that reimagined African universities would have the responsibility of ensuring that content enables students to eradicate poverty.\nThey noted that poverty, which is common in most African communities, is an outcome of inequality and marginalisation, unemployment, poor infrastructure, adverse competition for resources, market failures, absence of personal freedoms and never-ending conflicts.\nHowever, they said that most poverty in African countries could be reduced through social initiatives and ventures involving industry, government, civic organisations, and academia. Such initiatives include business incubators, internships, experiential learning, volunteer services, work-based learning, and aligning university courses with industrial development.\nTackling poverty\nThey also noted that the lack of adequate social networks and other social support mechanisms was fuelling poverty in most African countries. To overcome poverty and other social adversities, Kitawi and Wachira explained that reimagined universities could offer assistance.\nFor instance, universities could help communities and governments create local and national policies that encourage recycling, reduce carbon emissions and conserve energy. Furthermore, ambitious institutions can also align their carbon emission reduction targets with international agreements, such as the Paris Agreement.\nConsequently, reimagined African universities could create programmes and courses that promote education for sustainable development, effectively placing sustainability principles and practice at the core of teaching and learning.\nIn this context, Kitawi and Mumbi suggested that universities could promote food security through programmes that enhance the capacity of individuals, communities, and organisations to find solutions related to food and nutrition.\nSevere financial challenges\nHowever, despite the opportunities that could be available in the reimagined higher education agenda for Africa, the two academics argued that challenges lie ahead, as most universities on the continent currently face severe financial difficulties and are struggling to survive.\nBesides, few universities are currently ready to shift their academic programmes to the sustainability platform or to expand their learning and teaching by introducing specialised courses on sustainability, extension programmes, and community-driven initiatives.\nIn this context, educators in reimagined universities should appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of education for sustainable development, which requires versatile collaboration across disciplines, universities, and other organisations working on the sustainability agenda.\nWhat can be done?\nKitawi and Wachira suggested that universities uncertain about how to reimagine themselves should borrow ideas from their counterparts on the continent that are in the process of integrating education for sustainable development into their curricula.\nThis means that African universities can learn from the activities and strategies of others in the region as they reimagine themselves.\nStellenbosch University in South Africa was cited as an early leader in the new concept of reimagining African universities, having established the Centre for Sustainability Transitions, a flagship research, teaching, and training hub for entrepreneurship and green innovations.\nLagos Business School in Nigeria was noted as having a sustainability centre that does research on how corporations and other business entities can integrate sustainability issues into their operations.\nHowever, given the complex process of universities reimagining themselves through education for sustainability, Kitawi and Wachira have suggested that institutions could seek help from regional and international research centres that are implementing the sustainability agenda.\nFor instance, universities could establish partnerships with the Shared Value Africa Initiative, a pan-African body that assists and collaborates with African organisations seeking to create and implement strategies that build prosperous and sustainable economies and societies.\n“Universities could look for converging interests, especially in joint research projects that bring together business leaders, faculty and students, in a bid to link graduates with employers, as well as get to know the skills that are needed in the job market,” explained the authors.\nAfrican universities were also advised to work with the United Nations Global Compact, which provides a forum for local businesses and institutions committed to upholding human rights, fair labour practices, environmental responsibility, and anti-corruption.\nNetworking and funding\nReached for comment, Wachira said that, as a stepping stone, universities that aim to reimagine themselves through education for sustainable development could join the United Nations Principles for Responsible Management Education, or UN-PRME.\n“This is a global body within the United Nations network that collaborates with higher education business and management schools to provide future business leaders with the skills needed to balance economic value creation and societal sustainability goals,” said Wachira, who is the vice-chair of PRME Chapter Africa.\nThe challenges brought about by COVID-19 may have sparked the idea for African universities to reimagine themselves. However, the question remains whether most of them can manage to propel themselves into the future without restructuring and adequate funding.\nFor instance, according to Kenya’s Auditor-General, Nancy Gathungu, 35 public universities are experiencing a severe financial crisis and are technically insolvent, as the total pending bills in these institutions exceed KES70 billion (about US$541 million). Gathungu says the situation is affecting learning, staff payments, and the overall functioning of these institutions.\nHowever, granted that the Kenyan state of affairs regarding public universities is not identically replicated in other African countries, the prevailing crux of the matter is that the situation could be just a little better, the same, or even worse.\nProfessor Kenneth Kamwi Matengu, the vice-chancellor of the University of Namibia, notes elsewhere in the book that underfunding has left many African universities with inadequate infrastructure and insufficient resources for research and development, let alone the ability to try new ideas.\nHe clarified that, for many years, African universities have been operating under severe constraints, including, not only inadequate funding, but also a lack of capacity; brain drain; weak governance and leadership; and low-quality academic programmes.\nThis means that the capacity of African universities to reimagine their future and become change-makers and agents of progress in Africa is likely to remain muted without sufficient financial support from governments, guaranteed autonomy, and academic freedom.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The decision followed a report that urged a broader, intersectional approach to diversity in the fields of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM).\nFor six years, under the leadership of astrophysicist Lisa Harvey-Smith, the programme contributed to research, tools and resources aimed at breaking down structural barriers that limit women’s and girls’ participation in STEM education and careers.\nAt the time, the move to scrap it was framed as a step towards more inclusive progress.\nDoes that reasoning still hold one year later? As diversity and inclusion efforts face global cutbacks, it’s more important than ever to reflect on where Australia is heading. Are we truly building a more equitable STEM future?\nWhy diversity in STEM matters\nStructural barriers have long limited participation in STEM for women, people of colour, First Nations communities, people with disabilities, and those in low socio-economic groups.\nSuch barriers include stereotypes and bias, a lack of role models, limited flexible work arrangements and inadequate parental leave and childcare support.\nIf we achieved equity in STEM, everyone – including entire groups who have been systemically excluded in the past – would have equal access to opportunities, resources and recognition.\nFor a young Aboriginal woman studying engineering in a regional town, it would mean the same chance to apply for internships at top firms as peers who live in cities. She would have the same access to well-equipped labs and mentoring programmes, and an equal likelihood of being nominated for academic awards or leadership roles.\nImproving diversity in STEM is also critical to Australia’s capacity for innovation, particularly as we face global challenges such as climate change, disruption from artificial intelligence, and geopolitical instability.\nDiverse STEM teams are more likely to approach problems from multiple perspectives. They embody democratic values, driving innovation and strengthening resilience in the face of complex issues.\nYet, despite decades of gender-focused programmes, meaningful progress has been limited. STEM Equity Monitor 2024 data show that while the number of women in STEM has increased, only 37% of university STEM enrolments are women. When it comes to STEM jobs in Australia, only 15% are occupied by women.\nIf not an ambassador, then what?\nThe lack of diversity in STEM is driven by systemic barriers such as persistent stereotypes, a shortage of diverse role models, and unequal access to opportunities.\nAn independent report released in February 2024 recommended looking at diversity in a more inclusive way.\nInstead of focusing only on women in STEM, it suggested we consider how different aspects of a person’s identity – such as their gender, race or background – can combine and affect their experience.\nThis means some people may face additional challenges. For example, a migrant woman of colour in STEM might deal with more obstacles than a white woman in the same field, because of the way her different identities overlap.\nSo … where are we now?\nWhile adopting this view is commendable, the practical changes that have happened over the past year raise important questions about whether Australia is truly moving towards a more inclusive STEM landscape.\nIn August 2024, the government announced a AU$38 million (US$24.7 million) boost to STEM programmes, aligning with recommendations from the independent report. Two long-standing programmes were closed, while seven other initiatives received additional funding.\nHowever, many of the funded programmes still leave major gaps.\nFor instance, one of the few initiatives targeting school-aged students, the National Youth Science Forum, is mostly limited to Years 11 and 12. Yet we know that girls’ disengagement from STEM begins as early as primary school.\nSimilarly, while the Superstars of STEM initiative continues to receive investment, its focus remains on “inspiring” students through role models.\nInspiration alone is not enough. We need a sustained, systemic approach that changes attitudes and builds structures to support and retain diverse students throughout their STEM journey.\nA key tool may have been left underfunded\nOf all the initiatives announced, the STEM Equity Monitor received the smallest share of funding, despite being the key tool for tracking Australia’s progress on diversity in STEM.\nThe 2024 report still relies on some data last updated in 2022, reflecting a lack of commitment to maintaining a consistent, annual pulse on equity outcomes. Moreover, the monitor doesn’t provide intersectional analysis, limiting its ability to inform targeted, evidence-based actions.\nIn principle, it still makes sense to shift Australia’s strategy on diversity in STEM towards a more intersectional and systemic approach. However, the practical steps taken so far don’t seem to align with that vision. Funding decisions, programme closures and limited investment in data and accountability tools suggest a disconnect between intent and implementation.\nWithout clear action plans, inclusive design – which ensures STEM initiatives genuinely serve people of all backgrounds – and robust monitoring, there is a risk the new direction will be symbolic rather than transformative.\nMaria Vieira is a lecturer in education futures at the University of South Australia.

The build-up of greenhouse gases since the Industrial Revolution is already bringing threats to human health, agriculture and security, and if a rapid move towards renewables is not achieved, humanity’s very existence will be at risk.\nIf we are to achieve a just transition to sustainability and avoid authoritarian measures, then education is key. While we cannot all be climate scientists, every person can and must have a basic understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change, along with the skills and values to bring change.\nYoung people are well aware of this. A recent survey of about 5,000 undergraduate students in Brazil, Fiji, Kenya and Mozambique carried out by the Climate-U project showed a strong endorsement of climate change education at universities.\nAs many as 83% of students wanted to have more opportunities for climate learning in their university experience, and higher education lagged behind internet, social media, mainstream media and friends as a source of information on climate.\nThere have been some important developments in this area in recent years. Kenyatta University, Kenya, as part of the Climate-U project, revamped its Growing Leaders programme to engage with climate issues and establish the Green Education Hub to promote student-led environmental change.\nYet, to a large extent these initiatives have been confined to particular institutions. There is an urgent need to scale up these initiatives to reach a broader proportion of the population.\nClimate change course for undergraduates\nAfrica is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Ironically, it is a continent that has done very little to provoke this situation, which threatens the long-term livelihoods of millions of its citizens. Currently, Africa is also a continent that stands little chance of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.\nIt is against this backdrop that the Center for Education and Sustainable Development in Africa (CESDA), through collaboration with other partners among the Climate-U Network is bringing together African universities to offer a 12-week course on Climate Change and Sustainable Development (Acclimatise) for undergraduate students.\nThe Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) course is innovative in involving two distinctive elements: an online component that is common to all universities, and an in-person, experiential element that engages with each specific context. This combination allows the course to combine the required scientific literacy with practical skills and dispositions relevant to local realities.\nThe course involves participatory research and engagement with local communities to create opportunities to innovate, to empower and to co-create solutions to the challenges of climate change and sustainable development in Africa.\nWorking with local communities, learners have the opportunity to examine and co-create solutions on diverse topics including endogenous flood adaptation strategies; organic farming, agroforestry and conservation agriculture for climate rehabilitation; impacts of extreme weather events on public health; navigating climate change impacts on the blue economy, including challenges and adaptation strategies for fishing communities; disaster risk assessments; and community awareness of climate change adaptation and mitigation.\nAdditionally, the course and accompanying seminars contain case studies and success stories from all over the world in areas of climate change and sustainability practices. It also provides an opportunity to learn across local, national and regional boundaries.\nFostering a ‘can do’ mentality\nThe project’s central belief is that, if young African students can explore why climate change is happening, and what they can do about it in their daily lives – as individuals, as families, and as communities – then the battle is already half-won. It’s about positivity, fostering a ‘can do’ mentality, and empowerment.\nThere are many success stories across Africa of how individuals have embraced change and found innovative ways to climb out of poverty, produce nutritious food, generate renewable energy, make quality products out of ‘waste’ and develop resilience. These can be harnessed and integrated into a positive learning experience for students both within and outside the continent.\nThe project team believes it is high time education was given the priority it deserves, and that COIL can be a cost-effective way of passing on the message and reaching huge audiences across the African continent and beyond, while leveraging on an extensive network of expertise and resources.\nThis continent-wide initiative has the potential to make a substantial impact on accelerating the implementation of the SDGs and addressing growing climate change challenges in Africa.\nA ‘remarkable’ level of interest\nIntegrating the course into several African higher education institutions will strengthen the regional involvement of universities in climate change and sustainability dialogues and action.\nA unique element of the COIL course is that it will be offered to students across all disciplines in universities. This ensures that all students, not only those from an environmental science background, will be exposed to climate change and sustainable development education.\nGraduating many well-informed learners about climate change and sustainable development will contribute to diverse professionals who are multiplier agents in climate action.\nThe course uses local teaching and learning materials that document climate change and sustainable development challenges and solutions. Teaching the course using local case studies will play a significant role in helping students to personally relate more to the climate change and sustainable development challenges that they face on a daily basis.\nConscious that producing such a course is an immense challenge, it has been run as a pilot since February 2025, after which it will be reviewed and reformulated where necessary before rolling out across Africa and beyond. The pilot will end at the end of June.\nFor the pilot, 150 students have been selected in 10 universities: in Kenya: Kenyatta University, Kisii University, the University of Nairobi and Kenya Methodist University; in Ghana: the University for Development Studies, the University of Ghana and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology; as well as the Emmanuel Alayande University of Education in Nigeria; the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; and the University of Zambia.\nThe demand for places has massively exceeded the supply (the number of available places for registration was oversubscribed by a factor of 10, despite the very short time within which the course was advertised). This shows the remarkable level of interest from students that this course has generated. The pilot is funded by Gower Street Foundation.\nClimate learning essential for all professionals\nThe course is one of the legacy education projects that emerged from the African Year of Education 2024 and was presented at a high-level continental education conference hosted by the African Union in Mauritania from 9-11 December 2024.\nIt is also fully in line with the COP 29 ‘Baku Initiative on Human Development for Climate Resilience’, which focuses on ‘catalysing investment in education, skills, health, and well-being, in particular for children and youth … and enhancing environmental literacy through education standards’.\nAfter the pilot phase, the hope is to expand this initiative across many more universities on the continent. Given that the online component has already been developed, it is a relatively low-cost undertaking for new institutions.\nYet, there are inevitably challenges posed by curricular structures, with some institutions unwilling to offer optional units without a clear connection to disciplinary areas.\nThese traditional mindsets will need to shift if we are to provide the learning environment that African students want and need. Climate learning cannot be avoided in today’s world, and needs to be part of the knowledge base of every professional and citizen.\nIt is also hoped that the initiative will spread beyond the African continent. The Climate-U network now has 27 members in 10 countries in Latin America, Europe, Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and there are opportunities for developing provision in these other regions. Dialogue and knowledge exchange between these different cultural and language contexts will be vital for achieving planetary sustainability.\nResearch on climate change education to date has shown conclusively that knowledge, alone, is insufficient for bringing behaviour change.\nStudents also need to be inspired, to have real experiences of engaging with communities and to develop the skills needed to bring change. This new initiative brings together classroom and experiential learning to generate these different attributes needed by African students in the coming decades.\nUltimately, all universities need to provide these kinds of rich learning experiences on climate if we are to have any chance of heading off the monumental challenges ahead.\nJackline Nyerere is an associate professor of education and the director for international programmes and collaborations at Kenyatta University.

But Russia is trying to close in on the city once more, with troops advancing only 25 kilometres away, three years after Ukraine’s military forced them out of the region, writes Florin Zubascu for Science|Business.\nThe university is located in the city of Sumy, not too far from Ukraine’s eastern border with Russia and some 330 kilometres east of Kyiv. The university suffered significant damage from Russian missile strikes on the city back in April, which resulted in 35 deaths (including two students at the university), and over 100 injuries. The university’s international affairs office and several buildings were destroyed, causing approximately US$5.3 million in damage, according to Alla Krasulia, head of the university’s international affairs department.\nDespite the bombing, the university continues courses and research, including with international partners, and is now setting up a fundraising campaign to start rebuilding the campus. Since the attack, the university has already managed to partially repair the roof of its congress centre, which was also destroyed in the bombing. Ivan Kozii, vice-rector for scientific and pedagogic work, said the university does not have a lot of money and is looking for ways to attract international grants and rebuild parts of the campus, as well as ways to cut overhead costs by saving energy and installing a solar station.\nFull report on the Science|Business site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

A hardliner from the ruling party’s right-wing faction, Voridis drew criticism for his appointment in a March cabinet reshuffle, seen as a shift further to the right. The upcoming migration bill includes tougher penalties for undocumented migrants, including prison terms of up to three years, fines of €10,000 (US$11,500), and extended detention from 18 months to two years – measures Voridis says are meant to deter arrivals and encourage voluntary returns.\nGreece is a majority Orthodox Christian country, where the constitution recognises Orthodoxy as the prevailing religion. According to the Pew Research Center, the Muslim population in the country now exceeds 500,000, driven largely by increased migration in recent years.\nFull report on the Euractiv site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

This decrease comes despite the presence of 269 universities across the country. The survey attributes this drop to a range of factors, including economic challenges and shifting demographics. However, there is a slight silver lining: enrolment is projected to rise modestly by 0.8% in FY 2024, reaching an estimated 1.95 million students.\nThe downward trend in university enrolment stands in contrast to modest increases at other education levels, highlighting ongoing challenges in access to and retention in higher education. Policy-makers and education experts have expressed concern, noting that sustained investment and targeted reforms are needed to reverse the decline and ensure that more young Pakistanis can pursue university degrees.\nFull report on the ProPakistani site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The brief, first reported by CNN, was submitted to the court on Monday 9 June.\nThe signatories come from a range of backgrounds, united by a Harvard degree and concern for the future of their alma mater: a Wisconsin beer brewer, comedian Conan O’Brien, an Ohio fighter pilot, author Margaret Atwood, a South Dakota tribal leader and Massachusetts Democratic Governor Maura Healy, among other prominent members of communities across the country and globe. The group claims it’s the largest known alumni brief from a single school in history.\nFull report on the CNN site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Ohio State’s AI Fluency Initiative will embed AI education throughout the undergraduate curriculum. The programme will prioritise the incoming freshman class and onward, in order to make every Ohio State graduate “fluent in AI and how it can be responsibly applied to advance their field”.\nThe change comes as students are increasingly using ChatGPT and other resources to complete their schoolwork. The Pew Research Center found 26% of teenagers used ChatGPT for schoolwork in 2024, twice as many as in 2023.\nFull report on The Hill site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",
