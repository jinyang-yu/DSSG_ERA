Their NHL record-tying success of winning 10 on the road during this season's playoffs has allowed them the opportunity to close out the Oilers at home.\nWATCH | Panthers one win away from winning the Stanley Cup:\nPanthers 1 win away from repeating as Stanley Cup champions after defeating Oilers in Game 5\n3 days ago\nDuration 1:01Florida beats Edmonton 5-2 and takes a 3-2 series lead in the Stanley Cup final.

You don't need to change anything. You need to just be as good as possible.
