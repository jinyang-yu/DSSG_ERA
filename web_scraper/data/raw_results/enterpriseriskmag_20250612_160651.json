These disruptions have been caused by various factors, including financial, operational, cyber, ESG, and other risks.\nIntroduction\nGeopolitical and economic uncertainty, including tariff wars and shortages in skilled labour, are putting financial services supply chains under pressure. Direct and indirect suppliers are heavily relied upon, sometimes unknowingly, to support smooth operations and innovation, often considered prerequisites for success.\nThe negative impacts of a vulnerable supply chain on your firm could include increased costs, service interruptions, project delays, regulatory censure and ultimately a negative impact on customers and profits. On a more macro level, a global catastrophe, loss of internet, transport route disruption, or power interruption could undoubtedly knock out a whole range of services for a prolonged period. Not to mention the knock-on effects on more micro-level risks in the supply chains on your firm’s specific operations.\nIntegrating Supply Chain Risk Management into Enterprise Risk Management\nSupply Chain Risk Management (SCRM) is a critical component of a well-functioning Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework. By integrating SCRM into your ERM framework, you can ensure a holistic approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating supply chain risks across your entire organisation.\nSupply chain risks can be broadly categorised into geopolitical, economic, environmental, technological, and operational risks. For example, geopolitical tensions like the Ukraine war can disrupt supply chains by causing delays and increasing costs. Economic uncertainties, such as tariff wars, can lead to price volatility and supply shortages, or increased or port fees. One tip is to ensure that your entire supply chain is understood, and your firm’s risk universe or taxonomy incorporates the types of risks faced, as those above.\nKey Strategies for Effective SCRM\nA robust procurement and supplier management framework is essential for mitigating these risks. This framework should:\nBe Integrated with your Risk Framework: Ensuring that your supplier management framework is aligned with your internally established ERM framework, including your risk taxonomy, risk appetite statements, impact indicators, KRIs and relevant risk management processes.\nContextualise Risk Management: Risk management should be tailored to your firm’s specific environment and needs. This involves understanding the unique risks your firm faces and developing strategies that address these risks effectively.\nEstablish Effective Communication: Effective communication is key to managing supply chain risks. Ensure that all stakeholders, including suppliers, are aware of potential risks and the strategies in place to mitigate them. Regular updates and transparent communication can help build trust and ensure everyone is prepared to respond to disruptions.\nPrioritise Critical Suppliers: Focus on suppliers that impact your most important business services first. These suppliers are crucial to your operations, and ensuring their resilience can help maintain continuity and minimise disruptions.\nMake SCRM a Continual, Cyclical and Trigger based process: Continuously assess and manage risks throughout the supplier lifecycle alongside activities such as supplier assurance. This involves identifying potential risks, evaluating their impact, and implementing mitigation strategies.\nEstablish Excellent Relationship and Performance Management: Maintain strong relationships with suppliers and regularly monitor their performance. This ensures that suppliers meet your agreed standards/KPIs and can adapt to changing conditions.\nInclude Contingencies and Exit Plans: Have clear exit plans for disengaging from suppliers that no longer meet your requirements or pose significant risks. Develop contingency plans for the loss of key suppliers. This includes identifying alternative suppliers and ensuring they can quickly step in if needed.\nProvide Effective Staff Training: Proper training for staff that manage suppliers in your business is crucial to ensure they understand and can effectively implement supply chain risk management strategies. Training should cover risk identification, assessment, mitigation, and communication as well as supplier management processes.\nIn today’s volatile environment, supply chain resilience is more important than ever. Effective supply chain risk management requires robust collaboration between risk professionals, procurement/contract management professionals and those within your supply chain. By working together, these groups can optimise SCRM strategies, effectively train business contract owners, and enhance overall business resilience. This approach ensures that risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated comprehensively, leveraging the expertise of both teams and your suppliers to maintain operational continuity and minimise disruptions.\nMagazine\nNews\nInterest Groups\nProfiles\nResources\nEducation\nTraining & Events\nJobs\nIRM Foundation\nAbout\nINSTITUTE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\nIRM is the leading professional body for risk management.\nWe drive excellence in managing risk to ensure organisations are ready for the opportunities and threats of the future.\nVisit us at www.theirm.org\n© 2022 Institute of Risk Management.

This legislation holds large organisations accountable if they fail to prevent fraud committed by employees, agents, or subsidiaries acting on their behalf. The offence applies to businesses that meet specific size criteria based on employees, turnover, and assets.\nIf fraud occurs within an organisation and benefits the company, it can be prosecuted unless it can demonstrate reasonable fraud prevention measures were in place. This law aims to reshape corporate culture, encouraging businesses to proactively combat fraud rather than merely reacting to incidents. With fraud remaining a significant issue in England and Wales, this offence is a step toward strengthening corporate accountability and protecting victims.\nFraud is not just a financial crime, it’s a systemic risk that threatens businesses, economies, and society at large. In an era where digital transactions dominate and regulatory scrutiny intensifies, organisations must take a proactive stance in managing fraud risks. Effective Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is the cornerstone of this approach, ensuring businesses remain resilient against financial crime while fostering trust among stakeholders.\nFraud: A Growing Global Concern\nThe scale of fraud is staggering. According to recent reports, fraud costs the global economy trillions of dollars annually. From procurement fraud to cybercrime, organisations face an evolving landscape of threats that demand sophisticated risk management strategies. The financial and reputational damage caused by fraud can be devastating, leading to regulatory penalties, loss of investor confidence, and operational disruptions.\nBeyond corporate losses, fraud has far-reaching consequences for society. It erodes trust in financial institutions, increases costs for consumers, and diverts resources away from essential services. Governments and regulators worldwide are tightening compliance requirements, making it imperative for organisations to integrate robust fraud prevention measures into their risk frameworks.\nThe Role of Enterprise Risk Management\nERM is not just about compliance, it’s about strategic foresight. A well-structured ERM framework enables organisations to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and implement controls that mitigate fraud before it occurs. This proactive approach ensures that businesses are not merely reacting to fraud incidents but actively preventing them.\nKey components of an effective ERM strategy include:\nRisk Assessment & Monitoring – Continuously evaluating fraud risks and adapting strategies to emerging threats.\nInternal Controls & Governance – Establishing clear policies, ethical guidelines, and oversight mechanisms.\nTechnology & Data Analytics – Leveraging AI and machine learning to detect anomalies and prevent fraudulent activities.\nRegulatory Compliance – Aligning risk management practices with evolving legal requirements.\nBy embedding ERM into corporate culture, organisations can create a fraud-resistant environment that safeguards assets and enhances long-term sustainability.\nQualified Professionals: The Frontline Defence Against Fraud\nRisk management is only as effective as the people implementing it. Having qualified professionals in place is essential to meeting regulatory requirements and ensuring fraud prevention strategies are executed effectively. Certified risk managers bring expertise in fraud detection, compliance, and strategic risk mitigation, making them invaluable assets to any organisation.\nThe IRM champions the development of risk professionals through internationally recognised qualifications and training programs. By investing in skilled personnel, businesses can strengthen their fraud prevention capabilities and foster a culture of accountability.\nThe Responsibility of Organisations\nFraud prevention is not just a regulatory obligation, it’s a corporate responsibility. Organisations must take ownership of their risk management strategies, ensuring they are proactive, adaptive, and resilient. This means fostering a culture of integrity, equipping employees with the right tools, and collaborating with industry experts to stay ahead of fraud trends.\nI urge businesses to prioritise ERM as a fundamental pillar of their operations. The cost of inaction is far greater than the investment in prevention. By embracing a risk-aware mindset, organisations can protect themselves, their stakeholders, and the broader economy from the damaging effects of fraud.\nMagazine\nNews\nInterest Groups\nProfiles\nResources\nEducation\nTraining & Events\nJobs\nIRM Foundation\nAbout\nINSTITUTE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\nIRM is the leading professional body for risk management.\nWe drive excellence in managing risk to ensure organisations are ready for the opportunities and threats of the future.\nVisit us at www.theirm.org\n© 2022 Institute of Risk Management.

Artificial Intelligence has and is a driver of deep structural change in the workforce—one that carries complex social, operational, and ethical risks.\nRecent findings from the United Nations’ International Labour Organisation and Poland’s National Research Institute underscore this disruption: roles traditionally held by women, such as administrative and secretarial positions, are significantly more vulnerable to automation, with 9.6% of these roles at risk, compared to just 3.5% of jobs more commonly held by men. While these roles may not vanish outright, they will be forced to evolve rapidly to stay relevant in an AI driven environment.\nThe report’s key findings include:\nNew “exposure gradients”, which cluster occupations according to their level of exposure to Generative AI, help policymakers distinguish between jobs at high risk of full automation and those more likely to evolve through task transformation.\n25 per cent of global employment falls within occupations potentially exposed to GenAI, with higher shares in high-income countries (34 per cent).\nExposure among women continues to be significantly higher. In high-income countries, jobs at the highest risk of automation make up 9.6 per cent of female employment – a stark contrast to 3.5 per cent of such jobs among men.\nClerical jobs face the highest exposure of all, due to GenAI’s theoretical ability to automate many of their tasks. However, the expanding abilities of GenAI result in an increased exposure of some highly digitized cognitive jobs in media, software and finance-related occupations.\nFull job automation, however, remains limited, since many tasks, though done more efficiently, continue to require human involvement. The study highlights the possibly divergent paths for occupations accustomed to rapid digital transformations – such as software developers – and those where limited digital skills might have more negative effects.\nPolicies guiding the digital transitions will be a leading factor in determining the extent to which workers may be retained in occupations that are transforming as a result of AI, and how such transformation affects job quality.\nThe situation becomes even more concerning when we factor in broader labour market sentiment and adoption trends. As reported by LinkedIn’s Chief Economic Opportunity Officer Aneesh Raman in The New York Times, 63% of over 3,000 surveyed executives believe that AI will soon take over many of the mundane tasks currently assigned to entry-level employees. This shift is contributing to growing career pessimism among Generation Z—particularly troubling when combined with data showing that women are adopting AI tools at a significantly lower rate than men.\nLayering these insights together paints a sobering picture: a challenging and potentially inequitable job market is emerging for early career workers. This is not only a talent risk, but also a systemic risk with long-term implications for workforce diversity.\nFrom a risk management standpoint, organisations must be proactive. This means embedding AI risk into enterprise risk management frameworks, ensuring that digital workforce strategies account for equity and inclusion, and aligning reskilling initiatives with areas of greatest displacement risk. It’s also vital to close the gender adoption gap in AI tools and literacy—before it becomes another structural divide.\nIf we don’t address these disparities head on, we risk widening existing inequalities under the guise of technological progress.\nMagazine\nNews\nInterest Groups\nProfiles\nResources\nEducation\nTraining & Events\nJobs\nIRM Foundation\nAbout\nINSTITUTE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\nIRM is the leading professional body for risk management.\nWe drive excellence in managing risk to ensure organisations are ready for the opportunities and threats of the future.\nVisit us at www.theirm.org\n© 2022 Institute of Risk Management.

But building a truly cyber-aware culture—one where every employee feels empowered to act as a first line of defence—is where the real challenge lies.\nIt’s no longer enough to have policies or deliver an annual training session. Organisations need to foster a proactive and engaged workforce that understands the importance of cybersecurity and actively participates in mitigating risks. And that’s where Culture and Awareness come in—it’s the new front door to cybersecurity. Instead of only interacting with security when they’ve done something wrong, employees need a safe and approachable space to learn, ask questions, and report concerns without fear of blame or wrongdoing.\nGetting Executive Buy-In: It Starts at the Top\nBefore diving into strategies, it’s crucial to have leadership on board. Here’s how to get executive buy-in for your awareness initiatives:\nHighlight the ROI of Awareness: Quantify the potential cost savings of preventing security incidents through a more aware workforce. To compliment your data, include relevant and recent statistics from reputable sources.\nPaint a Picture of the Threat Landscape: Present real-world examples of cyberattacks targeting your business and those in your industry, emphasising the potential impact on your organisation.\nShowcase Success Stories: Share examples of how other organisations have benefited from strong cybersecurity cultures. This not only demonstrates the value of your efforts but can also enhance your organisation’s reputation in the eyes of customers and partners. In today’s risk-conscious environment, demonstrating a commitment to cybersecurity can be a key differentiator.\nBuilding a Cyber Aware Culture: Strategies for Success\nReady to cultivate a culture of security awareness? Here are key strategies for success:\nLaying the Foundation:\nKnow Your Audience: Understand your employees’ roles, responsibilities, current knowledge, challenges, and preferred learning styles. Consider time constraints, language barriers, and regional differences to tailor your approach effectively.\nDefine a Clear Purpose, Objectives and Measures of Success: Uncover the “why” driving your training. What specific behaviours or knowledge do you want to cultivate? This focus will keep your messaging on point and enable you to define what success looks like from day one.\nPrioritise Value, Not Volume: Don’t try to boil the ocean. Focus on the risks that pose the most immediate threat to your organisation. Is phishing your biggest concern? If so, start there! Tailor your training and awareness materials to address the specific tactics and themes you’re seeing. Are you noticing a surge in phishing attempts via social media? Use that insight to make your content hyper-relevant to your employees’ experiences. Remember to cover core topics like password security, safe browsing habits, data protection, and reporting suspicious activity. The more practical and applicable your training is, the more likely it is to resonate and drive real behaviour change.\nMake it Fun and Engaging: Explore gamification, rewards programmes, and interactive learning experiences to make training enjoyable and memorable.\nLeverage Existing Tools (and Explore New Ones): Don’t underestimate the power of simplicity. You can achieve a lot with the tools you already have! Platforms like Microsoft 365 offer a wealth of features that can be repurposed for creating engaging security awareness content. Think outside the box and get creative with tools like Teams, Forms, Sway, Stream, and SharePoint – sharing real-world phishing emails (with personal information redacted) and using polls or quizzes can be a highly effective quick win. However, as your programme matures, you might explore the vast array of specialised tools available. The key is to find the right balance between leveraging existing resources and investing in new solutions as your needs evolve.\nEmbrace Data-Driven Insights: Data is the foundation for building and continuously improving an effective awareness programme. Once you know your objectives, you can determine the best ways to measure their impact. The depth of your analysis will depend on the data available within your organisation. Some organisations have a wealth of data at their disposal, allowing them to measure impact across a range of core topics like phishing or password security. Others may be limited to more basic metrics, such as tracking the number of security incidents reported after training on reporting procedures. As your programme matures, you can work on defining new data streams and building your analytical capabilities. But remember, data isn’t just about numbers – gather feedback from your audience about their training experience to ensure your content is engaging and effective. Most importantly, look for evidence of behaviour change – are employees applying what they’ve learned in their day-to-day work?\nFoster Cross-Functional Collaboration: Break down silos and establish clear communication channels between IT, HR, Legal, Communications, L&D and other key departments to ensure everyone is aligned and working together towards a shared goal of a cyber-aware culture.\nEssential Tips for Continuous Improvement:\nProvide a Central Hub and Open Door: Create a central resource hub with security policies, training materials, FAQs, and contact information. Set up a dedicated cybersecurity mailbox to streamline inquiries and gather valuable insights into employee knowledge gaps and training needs.\nPersonalise the Experience: Enhance generic content and tailor training to specific roles and departments. Incorporate your company’s reporting procedures into scenarios for added relevance. And don’t forget to develop specialised programmes for high-risk roles relevant to your organisation for example developers, executives, HR, legal and finance teams.\nGo Beyond Traditional Training: Instead of relying solely on awareness campaigns, aim for sustainable behavioural change by creating an environment where secure choices become second nature. Integrate the 70:20:10 learning model, providing opportunities for employees to learn by doing (70%), collaborating with peers (20%), and participating in targeted, formal training (10%). This balanced approach caters to diverse learning styles and embeds security awareness into everyday work practices. Further, enhance this approach by leveraging proven, science-backed principles like Cognitive Load Theory and Nudge Theory to ensure training is engaging, easy to understand, and subtly guides employees towards secure behaviours. For an effective solution to building security awareness and behavioural change, consider SANS Security Awareness Training, which offers a comprehensive suite of resources designed to create a secure culture.\nEmbrace Innovative Delivery and Production Methods: A blended learning approach is key to catering to different learning styles and time constraints. To complement traditional training methods like webinars, explore a mix of engaging formats like microlearning videos, interactive scenarios, gamified activities, and short quizzes or polls. Don’t shy away from emerging technologies like AI to help automate tasks or even create content!\nKeep the Conversation Going: Building a cyber aware culture is a marathon, not a sprint. It’s essential to maintain engagement and momentum over time. This means being responsive and accessible to your employees. Respond promptly to questions and concerns, whether they come through email, internal platforms like Yammer, or in-person interactions. Even a simple out-of-office message setting expectations for response times can go a long way in demonstrating your commitment to employee engagement.\nShare Your Successes (and Challenges): Regularly share insights from your culture and awareness activities with key stakeholders. Highlight successes and challenges to demonstrate transparency, solicit feedback, and build support across the organisation.\nMeasuring Your Progress: The SANS Cyber Culture Maturity Model\nThe SANS Institute’s Cyber Culture Maturity Model provides a helpful framework for assessing your organisation’s progress in building a cyber aware culture.\nThe model uses a scale, with each level representing a different stage of maturity:\nLevelDescription1Non-Existent: No formal awareness programme in place.2Compliance Focused: The program is designed primarily to meet specific compliance or audit requirements. Training is limited to being offered on an annual or ad-hoc basis. Employees are unsure of organisational policies and/or their role in protecting their organisation’s information assets.3Promoting Awareness & Behaviour Change: The program identifies the target groups and training topics that have the greatest impact in managing human risk and ultimately supporting the organisation’s mission. The program goes beyond just annual training and includes continual reinforcement throughout the year. Content is communicated in an engaging and positive manner that encourages behaviour change. As a result, people understand and follow organisation policies and actively recognise, prevent, and report incidents.4Long-Term Sustainment & Culture Change: The program has the processes, resources, and leadership support in place for a long-term life cycle, including (at a minimum) an annual review and update of the program. As a result, the program is an established part of the organisation’s culture and is current and engaging. The program has gone beyond changing behaviour and is changing people’s beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions of security.5Metrics Framework: The program has a robust metrics framework aligned with the organisation’s mission to track progress and measure impact. As a result, the program is continuously improving and able to demonstrate return on investment. Metrics are an important part of every stage, and this level simply reinforces that to truly have a mature program, you must be able to demonstrate value to the organisation.\nBy using the SANS model as a guide, you can assess your organisation’s current maturity level and identify areas for growth. Remember, building a cyber aware culture is an ongoing journey, and there’s always room for improvement.\nBuilding a Secure Future, Together\nCreating a cyber-aware culture demands a sustained commitment from leadership, continuous improvement, and the active participation of every employee. By embracing these strategies and fostering a culture of shared responsibility, organisations can create a more secure future for themselves, their employees, and their stakeholders.\nMagazine\nNews\nInterest Groups\nProfiles\nResources\nEducation\nTraining & Events\nJobs\nIRM Foundation\nAbout\nINSTITUTE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\nIRM is the leading professional body for risk management.\nWe drive excellence in managing risk to ensure organisations are ready for the opportunities and threats of the future.\nVisit us at www.theirm.org\n© 2022 Institute of Risk Management.

The Online Safety Act 2023 is a law aimed at protecting both children and adults online by making social media companies and search services more accountable for user safety.\nThe Act requires platforms to:\n• Reduce risks of illegal activity and remove illegal content.\n• Protect children from harmful and age-inappropriate content.\n• Be transparent about harmful content for adults and give users more control over what they see.\nThe Online Safety Act applies to search services and any online platforms that let users post content or interact with others. This includes social media, cloud storage, video-sharing sites, online forums, dating apps, and messaging services. The Act also covers services based outside the UK if they have a significant number of UK users, target the UK market, or pose a material risk of harm to UK users.\nThe Online Safety Act requires platforms to perform risk assessments on how their algorithms might expose users to harmful or illegal content and take steps to reduce these risks. The law also addresses the danger of repeated content exposure, like when algorithms push large volumes to children quickly. Platforms must publish yearly reports on their safety measures and algorithm impact.\nCompanies that break the Online Safety Act can be fined up to £18 million or 10% of their global revenue, whichever is higher. Senior managers who do not comply with Ofcom’s information requests could face criminal charges. In severe cases, Ofcom can ask courts to block payment providers, advertisers, and internet services from working with a site, stopping it from making money or being accessed in the UK.\nChallenges Faced by Companies\nThe UK’s Online Safety Act, enacted in 2023, provided companies with a transition period to prepare for its enforcement, which began on March 17, 2025. During this time, organizations were expected to align their operations with the Act’s requirements to mitigate risks associated with illegal online content. While major tech companies have taken steps toward compliance, the preparedness across all companies varies. Despite the transition period allowing for adjustments, smaller platforms have struggled with resource constraints, making compliance particularly challenging (e.g., Fixed Gear and Single-Speed (LFGSS) forum).\nHow are various governments ensuring digital safety?\nSeveral countries have implemented online safety laws similar to the UK’s Online Safety Act:\n• Australia: In 2021, Australia passed its own Online Safety Act, mandating that digital platforms take reasonable measures to remove illegal or age-inappropriate content.\n• European Union: The EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA) requires online platforms to identify and reduce risks related to illegal and harmful content, closely aligning with the UK’s safety standards.\n• Sri Lanka: The country’s proposed Online Safety Bill aims to regulate online content and improve user protection, reflecting a similar approach to the UK’s legislation.\nThese examples reflect a global trend toward enhancing online safety and holding digital platforms accountable for user protection.\nBroader Potential Impact\nThe Online Safety Act aims to create a safer digital environment by holding online platforms accountable for harmful and illegal content. While its intentions are clear, the Act presents several operational, compliance, and strategic challenges that companies must navigate:\nOperational and Compliance Challenges\n• High financial and technical burdens, particularly for smaller platforms, to implement safety measures like content moderation and reporting.\n• Financial penalties for non-compliance can reach up to £18 million or 10% of global revenue, posing severe financial risks.\n• Smaller and niche platforms may face closure or reduced diversity due to high compliance costs.\nPrivacy and Encryption Concerns\n• End-to-end encryption may be weakened, raising privacy concerns and making platforms more vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n• Balancing safety improvements with data protection remains challenging.\n• If encryption backdoors are exploited, users’ private data could be at risk.\nAI-Related Risks\nThe Act indirectly introduces AI-related risks as platforms increasingly rely on automated systems for content moderation and risk assessment. Some of the key challenges include:\n• Excessive Blocking: Automated moderation may block legitimate content, stifling freedom of expression.\n• Algorithmic Bias: AI systems may disproportionately target specific groups, driven by biased data.\n• Opaque Decision-Making: Complex algorithms used for moderation might lack transparency, making it hard to ensure fairness and accountability.\n• Privacy Issues: Enhanced content monitoring could lead to intrusive data collection.\n• Context Misinterpretation: Automated moderation might misinterpret satire, sarcasm, or cultural references, leading to unjust content removal.\nImpact on Innovation and Platform Diversity\n• Smaller platforms may shut down or reduce services due to compliance costs, limiting diversity in online communities.\n• Dominance by major tech companies may increase as they are better positioned to meet compliance requirements.\nReputational Risk\n• Platforms that fail to protect users from harmful content may face backlash, eroding brand reputation and user trust.\n• Excessive content filtering could lead to accusations of censorship or bias.\nFinancial and Legal Risk\n• Non-compliance can result in hefty fines and legal disputes.\n• Potential class action lawsuits from users affected by data breaches or harmful content.\nGlobal Influence and Regulatory Fragmentation\n• The Act could encourage other countries to adopt similar regulations, creating a fragmented global regulatory landscape.\n• Companies operating globally may face challenges in harmonizing compliance strategies across jurisdictions.\nCybersecurity Risk\n• Backdoor access for monitoring could expose platforms to cyberattacks, putting user data at risk.\n• Greater risk of mass data leaks, damaging user trust and platform credibility.\nThe Road Ahead\nThe UK’s Online Safety Act represents a significant shift toward greater accountability and user protection in the digital space. While it aims to create a safer online environment, the law poses numerous challenges for companies, particularly smaller platforms, as they navigate compliance requirements and balance safety with privacy and innovation.\nAs more countries adopt similar legislation, businesses must proactively develop robust risk management strategies to address compliance, operational, and cybersecurity risks. Navigating the evolving regulatory landscape requires not only technical adaptations but also a careful consideration of the broader social and ethical implications. Ultimately, the success of the Online Safety Act will depend on achieving a delicate balance between safeguarding users and preserving fundamental digital rights.\ncyber risk, digital, Regulation, risk management\nMagazine\nNews\nInterest Groups\nProfiles\nResources\nEducation\nTraining & Events\nJobs\nIRM Foundation\nAbout\nINSTITUTE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\nIRM is the leading professional body for risk management.\nWe drive excellence in managing risk to ensure organisations are ready for the opportunities and threats of the future.\nVisit us at www.theirm.org\n© 2022 Institute of Risk Management.

But it is the inter-connected nature of such risks that has risen up the agenda.\nAnalysis of each individual risk category revealed the way that those threats were deeply linked to other risks. For example, while cyber risk is generally high up the agenda in any risk survey, the actual risk to the business can change from year to year.\n“A deeper dive into each risk reflects this interconnected story. Economic and financial risk, for example, reveals no single issue driving this concern,” the report said. “Similarly, people risk, which continues to be a top concern, combines various risk factors rather than a single dominant issue.”\nRisk management\nThis finding was reflected in the actions businesses were taking to mitigate complex, fast-moving threats. While talent and retention was the main concern in the people risk category, for instance, organisations did not focused solely on pay and reward. Instead, they had also used technology to increase employee engagement.\n“This holistic approach to risk management is a recurring theme throughout the report,” it said. “Through more joined-up thinking, UK business leaders are seemingly seeking to generate a snowball effect to drive efficiencies and growth.”\nResponse\nNot all sectors had approached their top risks with the same level of focus. For example, while 86 per cent in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors had reviewed employee training, only 45 per cent of respondents in the food and drink sector had done so.\nBut the report expressed concern that businesses were not planning to build on their recent successes in managing key risks during the year ahead. For example, fewer than one third (29 per cent) of respondents planned to invest in cybersecurity controls and only 21 per cent planned to invest in mental health support.\n“Allowing risk management efforts to drift is likely to make businesses less resilient to adverse events at a time when that resilience is vital to long-term success,” it said.\ncomplexity, risk management\nMagazine\nNews\nInterest Groups\nProfiles\nResources\nEducation\nTraining & Events\nJobs\nIRM Foundation\nAbout\nINSTITUTE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\nIRM is the leading professional body for risk management.\nWe drive excellence in managing risk to ensure organisations are ready for the opportunities and threats of the future.\nVisit us at www.theirm.org\n© 2022 Institute of Risk Management.

Most of that (£9 billion) related to money that HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) knows that it has not received because of fraud or error. A further £2 billion related to overpaid benefits and £1 billion was detected by other public bodies.\nReasonable care\nWhile HMRC collected about £843 billion of tax, it estimated that there was £30 billion it had not received “due to behaviours analogous to fraud and error,” the report said. Those included a failure to take reasonable care, error, evasion, criminal attacks and the hidden economy.\n“HMRC estimates that ‘taxpayers not taking reasonable care’ is the behaviour that contributes the highest share of the overall tax gap, with HMRC estimating it made up 30 per cent (£12 billion) of the overall difference between the tax it should have received, and the amount it actually received in 2022-23,” the report said.\nIn fact, small businesses were the biggest culprits across all groups and accounted for an estimated £24 billion of the overall sum. They accounted for 60 per cent of the taxpayers committing fraud or making errors – up from 37 per cent back in 2017-18.\nTackling the problem\nThe NAO said that HMRC’s lack of progress in its plans to make tax digital had contributed to the problem. In addition, HMRC did not know the impact of its levels of customer service on the amount of tax it collected, according to another NAO report published in 2024.\n“We also found that HMRC had been ‘unable to cope’ with telephone demand and had consequently fallen short in processing correspondence,” the report said, with about a third of calls going unanswered in 2023-24. The NAO recommended targeting its compliance activities in the most rewarding areas and reducing the complexity of the tax system.\ncorporate tax, fraud\nMagazine\nNews\nInterest Groups\nProfiles\nResources\nEducation\nTraining & Events\nJobs\nIRM Foundation\nAbout\nINSTITUTE OF RISK MANAGEMENT\nIRM is the leading professional body for risk management.\nWe drive excellence in managing risk to ensure organisations are ready for the opportunities and threats of the future.\nVisit us at www.theirm.org\n© 2022 Institute of Risk Management.
