The IFRS released the inaugural general sustainability (IFRS S1) and climate (IFRS S2) reporting standards in June 2023.\nRecently, the IFRS Foundation announced that 36 jurisdictions have moved to adopt or otherwise use the new ISSB standards, including 17 that have already finalized their approach to using the standards.\nAvailable on the IFRS Sustainability Knowledge Hub, the new course includes four modules, covering an introduction to the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, introductions to IFRS S1 and to IFRS S2, as well as integrated sustainability disclosures and organizational considerations.\nAfter completing each module, users have the option to take a short assessment to receive a certificate of completion, with members of professional accounting bodies, when eligible, able to earn CPD/CPE credits.\nSue Lloyd, ISSB Vice-Chair, said:\n“The ISSB is committed to supporting companies as they implement our Standards. We understand the need for accessible, practical resources to help preparers understand and apply IFRS S1 and IFRS S2. This e-learning course, along with our library of educational materials, will help equip individuals with the knowledge they need to understand our Standards and implement them effectively with the aim of providing decision-useful globally comparable sustainability-related information for investors.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

At the time, the Treasury announced that ASFI would be responsible for developing the Taxonomy, in collaboration with the government and the finance sector.\nThe release marks the latest in a series of initiatives across jurisdictions to set up a classification system for the definition of sustainable economic activities, including taxonomy systems already established or in development in the EU, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, Canada, and India.\nIn the Taxonomy document, ASFI said:\n“The taxonomy is an important component of the Government’s Roadmap. It will enable market participants to understand how certain economic activities and investments align with, or contribute to, climate and sustainability outcomes, thereby providing a robust basis to inform capital allocation decisions.”\nAustralia’s new taxonomy includes classifications for both green and transition activities. Green activities include those that meet criteria determined by Paris-aligned decarbonization scenarios, as well as those that directly enable the decarbonization of another activity. Transition activities include those that help decarbonize emissions-intensive activities move towards closer alignment with a 1.5°C pathway, in which substitutes to fully or more materially reduce emissions are not available.\nIn its first phase, the new taxonomy covers six key emissions-intensive sectors, including Agriculture and Land, Minerals, Mining and Metals, Manufacturing and Industry, Electricity Generation and Supply, Construction and Buildings, and Transport.\nASFI CEO, Kristy Graham, said:\n“To unlock global finance for Australia’s key green and transition sectors, the taxonomy had to be internationally credible and locally relevant.  In a world-first, it includes sectors such as minerals, mining and metals, and it also sets expectations for engagement with First Nations peoples and cultural heritage management.”\nFollowing the launch, ASFI said that it will pilot the taxonomy with a select group of financial institutions across a diverse range of use cases. Participants in the pilot include ANZ, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC), Commonwealth Bank of Australia, HESTA, Moody’s Ratings, NAB, Rabobank, Rest and Westpac.\nASFI also announced that sustainable finance standards body Climate Bonds Initiative will expand its Certification Scheme to include criteria, pathways, and measures in the new taxonomy that are consistent with the Climate Bonds Standard, to support standardization and convergence of global taxonomies, and to promote market adoption and investor confidence.\nSean Kidney, CEO and Co-Founder, Climate Bonds Initiative, said:\n“Australia’s Sustainable Finance Taxonomy is a shopping list of investments for the future. Climate Bonds Certification will now be able to confirm adherence to both the Australian and the Climate Bonds Taxonomies. This will support investor confidence in the credentials of sustainable financial investments.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

The proposal also included disclosure requirements for ESG-focused funds and integration funds to address potential exaggerated claims about ESG strategies.\nUnder the proposal, funds classified as ESG-focused that consider environmental factors also would have been required to disclose greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions metrics, such as the carbon footprint and carbon intensity of the fund’s portfolio.\nThe proposals also required ESG-focused funds to present information in a standardized, tabular format, enabling investors to quickly identify the types of ESG strategies being used, and to easily compare with other funds.\nIn its statement announcing the withdrawal of the proposal, the SEC said:\n“The Commission does not intend to issue final rules with respect to these proposals. If the Commission decides to pursue future regulatory action in any of these areas, it will issue a new proposed rule.”\nMark founded ESG Today following a 20 year career in investment management and research.

This is more than international flights and maritime shipping combined.\nThe original bill was introduced by MP Anne-Cécile Violland and supported across party lines. It proposes a series of regulatory measures aimed at discouraging overproduction and overconsumption.\nThese measures include new requirements for consumer information on the environmental impacts of clothing, a ban on advertising for fast fashion brands and products, and differentiated eco-contributions based on product sustainability.\nThe Senate’s version of the bill has expanded on these proposed requirements, establishing clearer legal criteria for defining fast fashion and including provisions to encourage clothing repair.\nAn announcement announcing the Senate’s decision said:\n“Never before have so many new items of clothing been put on the market. Each year, more than 100 billion items of clothing are sold worldwide. In France, in the space of a decade, the number of items of clothing sold annually has increased by one billion, and now standards at 3.3 billion products, or more than 48 per capita.”\nThe bill was first adopted by the National Assembly in March last year. It will now head to a joint committee of deputies and senators to reconcile the two chambers’ versions.\nOn a broader scale, last year the European Parliament voted in favor of a series of proposals aimed at reducing waste – including in the textile sector.\nThe parliament agreed that fashion brands and textile producers should be required to pay for the collection and recycling of clothing and footwear.\nEmanuela Hawker\nRelated Posts\nEnvironment /\nNasdaq Launches Carbon Credit Education Platform\nGovernment /\nAustralia Launches Sustainable Finance Taxonomy\nEnvironment /\nSBTi Launches Draft Net Zero Standard for Automotive Sector\n‹ Meta, XGS Sign Deal to Power Data Centers with Geothermal Energy › SEC Drops Proposed Anti-Greenwashing Fund Disclosure Rules\nESG Today Newsletter – Subscribe\nSubscribe to the ESG Today Newsletter\nJoin our mailing list for the latest breaking ESG investment news!\nLevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther\nFunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsR & DProcurement & ContractingSupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityStrategyTechnologyOther\nSUBSCRIBE!\nYou have Successfully Subscribed!\nSustainable Finance\nAustralia Launches Sustainable Finance Taxonomy\nFervo Energy Raises Over $200 Million to Build U.S. Geothermal Energy Project\nMunich Re Exits Major Net Zero Coalitions\nAccounting Body ACCA Calls on EU to Simplify Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation\nGovernment\nAustralia Launches Sustainable Finance Taxonomy\nFrench Senate Backs Law Curbing Environmental Impact of Fast Fashion\nEU Says Over €240 Billion Investment Needed for Nuclear Energy Plans\nEU Parliament’s Omnibus Negotiator Proposes Much Sharper Cuts to Sustainability Reporting Regulations\nCategories\nSelect Category\nCompanies\nEnergy Transition\nEnvironment\nESG Reporting\nESG Tools, Services\nExecutive Moves\nGovernance\nGovernment\nGuest Posts\nInvestors\nM&A\nNew funds & products\nPlatforms & Markets\nPrivate Equity & Venture Capital\nProfessional bodies\nRegulators\nReports, Studies\nSocial\nSocial & Governance\nSustainable Finance\nBack to Top\nHome\nAbout us\nDisclosure, cookies & privacy policy\n© ESG Today 2025\nDon't miss the top ESG stories!\nJoin the ESG Today daily newsletter and get all the top ESG stories, like this one.\nSubscribe now below!\nLevelC-LevelSVP / EVPDirector / VPManager / SupervisorMid or Entry LevelFreelance / ContractStudent / InternRetiredOther\nFunctionAccounting & FinanceBusiness Development & SalesCustomer SupportFacilitiesHR & TalentInvestingLegalMarketing & CommunicationsOperationsProcurement & ContractingR & DStrategySupply Chain & DistributionSustainabilityTechnologyOther\nSUBSCRIBE!\nYou have Successfully Subscribed!",
