It’s simple, it’s easy, it’s precise, and it just goes very quickly and I think Mark has a more complex idea, but also very good.”\nThe meeting follows weeks of calls and text messages between the pair as they try to resolve the trade war Trump launched with the imposition of multiple rounds of tariffs.\nCanada-U.S. Trade Minister Dominic LeBlanc told reporters afterwards that he’s confident progress was made during the meeting, and that officials from the two countries will meet again later this week.\n“We’re not there yet,” he said.\nCanada’s ambassador to the U.S. Kirsten Hillman added Trump is “very convinced” that tariffs are the best way to achieve his policy goals, but also expressed optimism that common ground could be reached.\n“We feel a sense of acceleration in the discussion in the last couple of weeks, and that is a very good thing,” she said.\nAsked during the official welcoming of G7 leaders how his meeting with Trump went, Carney replied: “Fantastic.”\n2:16\nG7 summit kicks off, Carney prepares for one-on-one with Trump\nTrump’s attendance at the G7 marks his first visit to Canada since he was re-elected as U.S. president. Since his election, he has made repeated comments that he believes Canada should become the “51st state,” remarks that have angered Canadians and led many to boycott American products and travel.\nStory continues below advertisement\nTrump did not repeat any such comments while speaking beside Carney to reporters.\nLeBlanc and Hillman wouldn’t say whether Trump mentioned annexing Canada during the meeting.\nForeign Affairs Minister Anita Anand has described the talks between the two world leaders as “sensitive” due to the deep integration between the Canadian and American economies, and Trump’s trade war which has seen successive rounds of tariffs imposed on Canada and other trading partners.\nGet breaking National news\nFor news impacting Canada and around the world, sign up for breaking news alerts delivered directly to you when they happen.\nSign up for breaking National newsletter\nSign Up\nBy providing your email address, you have read and agree to Global News' Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\nAfter announcing the formal signing of a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom later on Monday, Trump said “we have many other ones coming.”\nView image in full screen\nCanada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney, right, and his wife Diana Fox Carney, left, pose with President Donald Trump during the official welcome of the G7 Summit, Monday, June 16, 2025, in Kananaskis, Canada.

The prime minister was due to hold one-on-one meetings with those leaders as well.\nStory continues below advertisement\nAt the start of Monday’s opening working session, Carney said the G7 forum must adapt to confront at a new “hinge moment” in history, including rising global threats and economic instability.\n“We have to change with the times and to build a better world,” he said before turning to Trump, who was seated next to him at the meeting table.\n“Some of you, such as you Mr. President, have anticipated these massive changes and are taking bold measures to address them,” Carney said.\n“All of us around this table are reinforcing our militaries and security services for the new world. But we all know there can be no security without economic prosperity, and no prosperity without resilience. And in a world where shocks flow across the borders, that resilience comes from cooperation — cooperation that starts around this table.”\nView image in full screen\nItaly’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, from left, France’s President Emmanuel Macron, Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney, President Donald Trump, Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Germany’s Chancellor Friedrich Merz participate in a session of the G7 Summit, Monday, June 16, 2025, in Kananaskis, Canada.

But I’d say Iran is not winning this war and they should talk and they should talk immediately before it’s too late.”\nAsked what it would take for the U.S. to become involved militarily, Trump said “I don’t want to talk about that.”\n0:42\n‘Should have done that before’: Trump says Iran wants to negotiate as conflict with Israel grows\nThe president also brought up previous comments he’s made about having Russian President Vladimir Putin at the summit, once again calling it a “mistake” that the country was removed in March 2014 after its annexation of Crimea.\nStory continues below advertisement\n“That was a mistake because I think you wouldn’t have a war (in Ukraine) right now if you had Russia and you wouldn’t have a war right now if Trump were president four years ago,” he said.\n“It was a mistake in that you spend so much time talking about Russia and he’s no longer at the table, so it makes life more complicated.”\nHe falsely accused former prime minister Justin Trudeau of leading efforts to push Russia out, despite Trudeau not taking office until 2015.\nMore on Canada\nMore videos\nCanada Strong Pass grants free admission to national parks, historic sites this summer\nDonald Trump leaving G7 summit early because of crisis in Middle East\nWhy have gas prices gone up recently, and will they keep climbing?\nDrop in Canadian tourists hurting U.S., northeast governors tell premiers\nTrump says trade deal with Canada is ‘achievable’ as he meets with Carney\nHundreds protest in Calgary ahead of G7 summit\nCanadian fighter jets intercept civilian plane over Kananaskis during G7 summit\n3-year-old child killed after being hit by starting gate at N.B. harness race\nTrump was also asked whether he feels Putin should have a seat at the G7 now.\n“I’m not saying he should at this point because too much water has gone over the dam, maybe,” he said.\nTrump was also asked whether China should be invited to attend the G7 Summit, being the world’s biggest economy next to the U.S.\n“It’s not a bad idea, I don’t mind that if somebody wants to suggest China coming in,” he said.\n“But you want to have people that you can talk to, you know, they don’t talk… Putin speaks to me, doesn’t speak to anybody else. He doesn’t want to talk because he was very insulted when he got thrown out of the G8.”\nStory continues below advertisement\n—With files from the Canadian Press\nJournalistic standards\nComment\nReport an error\n© 2025 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.\nSponsored content\nMore from Global News\n23AndMe had ‘inadequate’ security before ‘profoundly damaging’ hack: probe\nCarney to hold talks with Modi, Zelenskyy as G7 summit enters final day\nAdvertisement\nStay in the loop\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\nSign up for National newsletter\nSign Up\nTrending\nTrump denies leaving G7 to work on Israel, Iran ceasefire amid conflict\n15,302\nRead\nDonald Trump leaving G7 summit early because of crisis in Middle East\n9,361\nRead\nWife of Minnesota senator shielded their daughter from gunfire, nephew says\n9,298\nRead\nWhy have gas prices gone up recently, and will they keep climbing?\n9,014\nRead\nCanada Strong Pass grants free admission to national parks, historic sites this summer\n7,977\nRead\nTrump family enters the mobile phone game with $499 cellphone\n6,254\nRead\nTop Videos\nMiddle East air travel disrupted as Israel-Iran conflict escalates\n475\nViewed\n‘A real end’: Trump says he wants Iran to ‘give up entirely’ on nuclear weapons\n455\nViewed\nIsrael, Iran trade deadly strikes for fourth day with no signs of slowing down\n337\nViewed\n‘Should have done that before’: Trump says Iran wants to negotiate as conflict with Israel grows\n229\nViewed\nIranian strike on Israeli city of Petah Tikva kills 3, wounds at least 20\n132\nViewed\nMoney Matters:  Starting saving for retirement later in life\n105\nViewed\nMore Videos\nStay in the loop\nThe email you need for the day’s top news stories from Canada and around the world.\nSign up for National newsletter\nSign Up\nAdvertisement\nReport an Error\nSubscribe here\nAdChoices\nGlobal News Facebook Pages\nGlobal News Twitter Accounts\nGlobal News Youtube Channel\nGlobal News on Instagram\nGlobal News on LinkedIn\nGlobal News on TikTok\nGlobal News on Telegram\nGlobal News on BlueSky\nAbout\nPrinciples & Practices\nBranded Content\nContact us\nRSS\nNewsletters\nNotifications\nSmart home\nAdvertisers Election Registry\nGlobal News Licensing Requests\nCookie consent\n©2025 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Sarah Komadina has more.\nLeave a comment\nShare this item on Facebook\nShare this item via WhatsApp\nShare this item on Twitter\nSend this page to someone via email\nSee more sharing options\nShare\nClose\nShare this item on Facebook\nfacebook\nShare this item on Twitter\ntwitter\nSend this page to someone via email\nemail\nShare this item via WhatsApp\nwhatsapp\nShare this item on Pocket\npocket\nShare this item via Telegram\ntelegram\nShare this item on Reddit\nreddit\nShare this item on BlueSky\nbluesky\nCopy article link\nCopy link\nDescrease article font size\nIncrease article font size\nThe organization representing Alberta doctors is joining health-care worker unions in raising concerns over Premier Danielle Smith’s decision to charge most Albertans for a COVID-19 vaccination this fall.\nDr. Shelley Duggan, president of the Alberta Medical Association, says the policy leaves behind many seniors and health-care workers, and doesn’t even mention pregnant individuals, First Nations, Inuit, Métis or members of other racialized groups.\nShe says creating barriers to vaccination for the most high-need groups is counterproductive.\nGet weekly health news\nReceive the latest medical news and health information delivered to you every Sunday.\nSign up for weekly health newsletter\nSign Up\nBy providing your email address, you have read and agree to Global News' Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.\nThe association head also notes pieces of the policy are counter to recommendations from Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization.\nHowever, Duggan says she appreciates that the government is encouraging measles vaccination.\nSmith says her government is looking to prevent wastage, recover costs, and target vaccinations to those who need them the most.\nTrending Now\nTrump denies leaving G7 to work on Israel, Iran ceasefire amid conflict\nTrump family enters the mobile phone game with $499 cellphone\nStory continues below advertisement\n2:18\nMajority of Albertans to pay for COVID-19 vaccine\nJournalistic standards\nComment\nReport an error\n© 2025 The Canadian Press\nSponsored content\nMore from Global News\n23AndMe had ‘inadequate’ security before ‘profoundly damaging’ hack: probe\nPurdue Pharma, Sackler family to settle U.S. opioid lawsuits for US$7.4B\nAdvertisement\nStay in the loop\nThe latest health and medical news emailed to you every Sunday.\nSign up for Health IQ newsletter\nSign Up\nTrending\nTrump denies leaving G7 to work on Israel, Iran ceasefire amid conflict\n15,302\nRead\nDonald Trump leaving G7 summit early because of crisis in Middle East\n9,361\nRead\nWife of Minnesota senator shielded their daughter from gunfire, nephew says\n9,298\nRead\nWhy have gas prices gone up recently, and will they keep climbing?\n9,014\nRead\nCanada Strong Pass grants free admission to national parks, historic sites this summer\n7,977\nRead\nTrump family enters the mobile phone game with $499 cellphone\n6,254\nRead\nTop Videos\nMiddle East air travel disrupted as Israel-Iran conflict escalates\n475\nViewed\n‘A real end’: Trump says he wants Iran to ‘give up entirely’ on nuclear weapons\n455\nViewed\nIsrael, Iran trade deadly strikes for fourth day with no signs of slowing down\n337\nViewed\n‘Should have done that before’: Trump says Iran wants to negotiate as conflict with Israel grows\n229\nViewed\nIranian strike on Israeli city of Petah Tikva kills 3, wounds at least 20\n132\nViewed\nMoney Matters:  Starting saving for retirement later in life\n105\nViewed\nMore Videos\nStay in the loop\nThe latest health and medical news emailed to you every Sunday.\nSign up for Health IQ newsletter\nSign Up\nAdvertisement\nReport an Error\nSubscribe here\nAdChoices\nGlobal News Facebook Pages\nGlobal News Twitter Accounts\nGlobal News Youtube Channel\nGlobal News on Instagram\nGlobal News on LinkedIn\nGlobal News on TikTok\nGlobal News on Telegram\nGlobal News on BlueSky\nAbout\nPrinciples & Practices\nBranded Content\nContact us\nRSS\nNewsletters\nNotifications\nSmart home\nAdvertisers Election Registry\nGlobal News Licensing Requests\nCookie consent\n©2025 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.

Retirement for some means just scraping by, and a recent report from B.C.’s seniors advocate found that one in four British Columbian seniors’ incomes are below the poverty line.\nThe centre operates on a budget of about $650,000 and just broke even last year.\nStory continues below advertisement\nThey own their building, but still have to deal with property taxes and the cost of maintenance and upkeep.\n3:21\nB.C. seniors waiting for years for affordable housing\nTrending Now\nTrump denies leaving G7 to work on Israel, Iran ceasefire amid conflict\nCanada Strong Pass grants free admission to national parks, historic sites this summer\n“The big deal is that we receive no guaranteed yearly funding, we don’t have any government handouts, etc. … we have to raise all the money ourselves,” Wood said.\n“All the volunteers we have are the only reason this place works at all,” Added McPherson. “That’s a huge cost savings that we’re able to pass on as food savings for our membership.”\nLunch is typically packed, with hot meals going for $12 and frozen dinners priced at $6 to $8.\nLast month, they sold nearly 2,500 of the frozen meals, but the rising cost of food has forced them to get creative to cover the bills.\nStory continues below advertisement\nThey’ve recently started trying to run monthly online 50-50 draws, with half the purse going to cover their food program.\nBut Wood admits there are challenges with the draw — including savvy online seniors fearing it could be a scam.\nBut until they can secure a more stable source of funding, it’s keeping the lights on — and members with tummies full and smiles on their faces.\n“We just want to make it a joy to be here, and if somebody just needs to get out of their house because they are feeling lonely, they can come here,” he said.\n“So if we can get people in here enjoying a $12 meal, but then meeting people and it turns into a conversation, that’s what the seniors need.”\nJournalistic standards\nComment\nReport an error\n© 2025 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.\nSponsored content\nMore from Global News\n23AndMe had ‘inadequate’ security before ‘profoundly damaging’ hack: probe\nPurdue Pharma, Sackler family to settle U.S. opioid lawsuits for US$7.4B\nAdvertisement\nStay in the loop\nThe latest health and medical news emailed to you every Sunday.\nSign up for Health IQ newsletter\nSign Up\nTrending\nTrump denies leaving G7 to work on Israel, Iran ceasefire amid conflict\n15,302\nRead\nDonald Trump leaving G7 summit early because of crisis in Middle East\n9,361\nRead\nWife of Minnesota senator shielded their daughter from gunfire, nephew says\n9,298\nRead\nWhy have gas prices gone up recently, and will they keep climbing?\n9,014\nRead\nCanada Strong Pass grants free admission to national parks, historic sites this summer\n7,977\nRead\nTrump family enters the mobile phone game with $499 cellphone\n6,254\nRead\nTop Videos\nMiddle East air travel disrupted as Israel-Iran conflict escalates\n475\nViewed\n‘A real end’: Trump says he wants Iran to ‘give up entirely’ on nuclear weapons\n455\nViewed\nIsrael, Iran trade deadly strikes for fourth day with no signs of slowing down\n337\nViewed\n‘Should have done that before’: Trump says Iran wants to negotiate as conflict with Israel grows\n229\nViewed\nIranian strike on Israeli city of Petah Tikva kills 3, wounds at least 20\n132\nViewed\nMoney Matters:  Starting saving for retirement later in life\n105\nViewed\nMore Videos\nStay in the loop\nThe latest health and medical news emailed to you every Sunday.\nSign up for Health IQ newsletter\nSign Up\nAdvertisement\nReport an Error\nSubscribe here\nAdChoices\nGlobal News Facebook Pages\nGlobal News Twitter Accounts\nGlobal News Youtube Channel\nGlobal News on Instagram\nGlobal News on LinkedIn\nGlobal News on TikTok\nGlobal News on Telegram\nGlobal News on BlueSky\nAbout\nPrinciples & Practices\nBranded Content\nContact us\nRSS\nNewsletters\nNotifications\nSmart home\nAdvertisers Election Registry\nGlobal News Licensing Requests\nCookie consent\n©2025 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
