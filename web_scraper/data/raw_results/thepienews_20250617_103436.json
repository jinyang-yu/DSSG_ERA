Photo: Special Arrangement.\nInternational student hailing from Gujarat one of those tragically killed in devastating air accident.\nUK universities issue heartfelt statements mourning the dead as Coventry University confirms two incoming students were killed in the crash.\nInstitutions issue guidance for international students as leaders look to amp up student support.\nExceptional, intellectually curious, generous, and a passionate cricket enthusiast – that’s how professors and friends remember 22-year-old Dirdh Patel, the Gujarat native who was among at least 271 people killed in last week’s tragic Air India Ahmedabad–London flight crash.\nPatel, who had been pursuing an MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Huddersfield since last year, was living with his brother and sister-in-law in Leeds and working as an AI/ML engineering intern in the UK when he travelled to India for personal reasons.\nRiya Parmar, who studied with Patel at Dharmsinh Desai University during their undergraduate years, struggled to come to terms with the tragedy, recalling how she had met him just days before the crash, unaware it would be the last time she saw him.\n“He always had a dream to start something of his own. That’s why he decided to go to the UK, to earn in pounds,” Parmar told The PIE News.\nWe are still in shock that he’s gone, all we have now are memories\nRiya Parmar, friend of Dirdh Patel\n“As a student, he was one of the brightest, both in school and university. He always helped his friends with assignments and was our go-to last-minute teacher before exams. And, as a person, so kind and incredibly humble.”\nDescribed as an “extrovert” and deeply “spiritual” at the same time, Patel had always dreamed of travelling across Europe, a dream Parmar still can’t believe he will never get to fulfil.\n“We are still in shock that he’s gone, all we have now are memories,” she said. “We attended his funeral, and we are all trying our best to support his parents through this difficult time.”\nFor the University of Huddersfield, Patel’s passing meant the loss of a standout student, someone who was at the top of his class and well on his way to making a meaningful impact in the world.\n“He had a clear ability of seeing the bigger picture and how his learning could lead to making a positive impact in the world. This led him to graduate at the top of his class, achieving the highest average among all MSc AI students in his cohort,” stated Dr George Bargiannis, reader in artificial intelligence, School of Computing and Engineering at the University of Huddersfield, who was a mentor to Patel even after his graduation.\nCoventry University also issued a statement mourning the loss of two incoming students, highlighting the profound impact the tragedy has had on UK universities as students return from travel breaks or prepare to join their respective programs.\n“These were young lives filled with dreams, aspirations, and the promise of a bright future. Our thoughts and deepest condolences are with their families and loved ones during this incredibly difficult time,” read a statement by Tarang Chowdhury, regional director, South Asia at Coventry University.\nThe Air India Flight 171 crash claimed the lives of 169 Indian nationals, 52 British nationals, seven Portuguese nationals, and one Canadian, leaving only one survivor.\nIt also killed 30 people on the ground, many of them students from Ahmedabad’s BJ Medical College, sending shockwaves through the international education sectors of both India and the UK, as the tragedy took the lives of not only students but also professionals within the industry.\n“As soon as the news of the crash broke on the news channels, many of our partners – including senior leadership and several vice-chancellors – promptly reached out to enquire about the safety of our staff and students,” said Jasminder Khanna, co-founder of Gresham Global, a Mumbai-based representation firm supporting recruitment operations for UK universities in South Asia.\n“While there were some students scheduled to travel to the UK for the summer course, thankfully, none (among partner universities) were on flight AI 131. I had calls and messages from almost all of our partner universities including the non-UK ones.”\nThe incident also comes just a month after India and the UK signed a free trade agreement aimed not only at reducing tariffs and boosting exports, but also at enhancing mobility between the two countries.\nThe growing bilateral relationship between India and the UK, which now relies heavily on smoother travel between the two countries, has also prompted UK universities to introduce new support measures for their students in India, especially in light of the recent plane crash.\nWhile we already maintain strong engagement through pre-departure support and arrival briefings, we recognise that situations like this call for more structured and anticipatory outreach\nDisha Gupta, Birmingham City University\nIn the days following the incident, multiple Air India flights have been cancelled, including a London-bound flight from Ahmedabad that was grounded due to operational issues.\n“I am hoping that such incidents never ever happen but it is not under anyone’s control. We are not advising students for any specific for or against any airlines at all,” stated Jaspreet Kaur, principal adviser (South Asia) supporting Queen Mary University of London, UK-India Business Council.\n“However, we have been advising to watch out the airspace criteria as there are more issues with the air routes from India to UK at the moment.”\n“As soon as news of the crash surfaced, our international recruitment team in South Asia immediately began reaching out to current applicants and partner agents in the region – particularly in Gujarat – to check in, offer reassurance, and provide any necessary support,” stated Disha Gupta, head of operations and recruitment, India, UAE, Nepal and Sri Lanka at Birmingham City University.\nAccording to Gupta, in addition to university-wide communications and dedicated counselling and support services, the institution is also introducing wellbeing check-ins throughout the admissions journey, in collaboration with its partners across India.\n“While we already maintain strong engagement through pre-departure support and arrival briefings, we recognise that situations like this call for more structured and anticipatory outreach. We are working closely with our internal support teams to see how we can embed this within our wider international student experience strategy,” she added.\nWhile India’s directorate general of civil aviation has reportedly found no major safety concerns with Air India’s Dreamliner fleet, the aircraft model involved in the crash, a Reuters report revealed that the aviation authority has requested pilot and dispatcher records from Air India as part of its ongoing investigation.\nIn a separate memo dated June 16, the DGCA has also urged flying schools across the country to “strictly follow additional safety and operational measures”.\nAbhishek Nair\nAbhishek Nair is a freelance journalist based out of Mumbai, with experience in covering sports and education across India.

The PIE spoke to CEO Jamie Beaton about the current political outlook and if the American dream is still alive for prospective students.\nby Nicholas Cuthbert\nJune 17 2025\n3 Min Read\nShare\nCopied!\n0\nAdd Your Opinion\nCrimson CEO, Jamie Beaton, has inspired many global students to study at the highest ranked universities in the world. Photo: Crimson\n“The trend for the last 10 years has actually been the rise of the dominance of US universities – with the number of institutions with admissions rates below 8% growing dramatically,” explains Beaton, as he outlines how competitive US admissions are for prospective students.\n“Schools like NYU, the biggest international recruiter in the US, have gone from a 40% admissions rate down to a 7% admissions rates. Johns Hopkins has gone for 15% to 5%. Duke University has seen double the number applications,” Beaton continues.\nThe Kiwi entrepreneur has first-hand experience, having himself graduated from Harvard, Standford and Yale in recent years, along with studying at Oxford and King’s in the UK and Tsinghua in China.\nCrimson Education, the company he founded as a 17 year old Harvard student is now valued at over USD $1 billion, specialising in supporting families to apply to the world’s most prestigious universities.\nBeaton believes that the appeal for US education is linked to curriculum design. While many countries have increasingly opted for degree pathways preparing students for specific industry careers, the US system offers more flexibility.\n“People need multifaceted subject experiences” he explains. “18-year-olds don’t know what they want to do and it’s hard to even guess what the jobs will be in 10 years post their graduation.\n“Interest in liberal arts is ascending, and I would say the era of the single degree where all classes are one area is relatively declining – it is a structure disadvantage in a world that’s moving fast.”\nThere is no better example of fast-paced change than US politics, where sweeping changes to legislation are being proposed at break-neck speed.\nThe US government recently made global headlines by suspending student visa appointments and limiting the powers of institutions like Harvard University – so what are students making of these news headlines and is it impacting US appeal?\n“My average family in China or in Korea or in India [applying through Crimson Education] is not blinking” reveals Beaton.\n“Basically, they’re really resolute. You can’t just wake up one day and decide to apply to America – you normally have a lot of planning, often for four years before you go. What that means is that you need to be default-preparing if you want to go to the US.\n“Often my students will apply to Oxbridge and the US top schools, but the optimal strategy continues to be you build a great US profile and indirectly you’ll build a very good Oxford-UK profile as well.\n“If you need to, you can take a gap year from the US and if you still want to graduate in four years, you can do advanced standard, which means you do APs and A-levels and you can finish your degree in three years rather than four – which is what I did.\n“That means you’ve got up to 18 months past when you apply if you’re in the Southern Hemisphere, a full year plus your gap between applications being submitted and the result, or in the Northern Hemisphere you have 14 months which is plenty of protection [from any political disruption] and even in a really apocalyptic situation like Covid-19 you can still take online courses from Harvard, or begin an exchange semester.\n“The number of scenarios where a determined US student has to ‘blink’ is not that high. You can’t be a Canadian-bound applicant who adds Yale the last minute – but you can be a Yale applicant who adds Canada at the last minute.”\nThe US economy has often been seen as a gold-plated environments for graduates, where they can graduate from top colleges and then progress directly into graduate jobs in finance, tech, medicine or law.\n“The US is incredibly resilient,” continues Beaton. “I would say the American dream is alive and well – the problems we’re seeing are a function of the fact that the American dream is not as accessible to everyone.\n“President Trump is creating an opportunity for future politicians to ruffle feathers in a way that creates elevated risk for some institutions, but ultimately, I think it’s largely noise, a way of dominating the news-cycle.\n“Even if a certain administration was trying to take a wrecking ball through some of these universities, it will be very hard to structurally dislocate how influential and desirable they are on the world stage.\n“If you look at this from the media, Harvard is getting bombed out in all directions. Funding cuts, international student bans, it should be reeling. But I was at the graduation there and it was jubilant excitement. There was a sense of consolidation behind the University president and while there are clearly challenges, the core university is incredibly strong and durable.”\nNicholas Cuthbert\nNick began his career with Nottingham Trent University in the UK working in international student recruitment, before going on to a wide range of leadership and consultancy roles in the private sector.
