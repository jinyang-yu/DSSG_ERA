African land convoy to Gaza\nWagdy Sawahel  12 June  2025\nTweet\rAcademics, students and unions representing professionals including doctors, engineers, journalists and lawyers, have joined civil society associations from Tunisia, Mauritania, Morocco and Algeria in a North African convoy that is heading to Gaza to support the Palestinian people amid a worsening humanitarian crisis – in breach of Israel’s 18-year blockade of the Gaza Strip.\nThe Maghreb Resilience Convoy, also known as Sumoud – Arabic for resilience or steadfastness – will travel across land from Tunisia through Libya and Egypt to reach Rafah, the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza, that has remained largely closed since Israel’s military took control of the area in May 2024.\nIt set off from central Tunis on 9 June, at the same time the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an aid ship that set sail from Sicily earlier this month, was seized by Israeli forces.\nFollowing the seizure of the aid ship, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said that Israel would not allow anyone to break the blockade of Gaza, which was aimed at preventing the supply of arms to Hamas, MSN reported.\nThe Maghreb Resilience Convoy was organised by the  Joint Action Coordination Committee for Palestine in Tunisia.\nThe protest is supported by major national organisations, with a group of prominent Tunisian civil society actors participating, including the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT), the National Union of Tunisian Journalists, the National Order of Lawyers in Tunisia, the Tunisian League for the Defence of Human Rights, the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights, the Order of Tunisian Doctors, the Tunisian Association of Young Lawyers, the Tunisian Organisation of Young Doctors, the Association of One Million Rural Women and Landless, and the Tunisian Network to Confront the Normalisation System (referring to diplomatic relations with Israel).\nThe UGTT, Tunisia’s largest labour union, is an umbrella organisation that includes student movements, academic associations and university-based unions, including the General Federation of Higher Education and Scientific Research (La Fédération Générale de l’Enseignement Supérieur et de la Recherche Scientifique).\nWassim Ben Messaoud, the secretary general of the Tunisian General Union of Students, in a statement on 9 June said the union supported the convoy, accusing Israel of waging “genocidal war” and “systematic starvation of more than two million Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, in full view of all the ‘civilized’ countries of the world”.\n“We call on all students, youth organisations, and students in Tunisia and the Arab and Islamic world to actively engage in supporting Palestinian rights and participate in international solidarity activities,” Ben Messaoud added.\nMohamed El-Koury Ahmed Ibrahim, the president of the Association of Mauritanian Students in Tunisia, told University World News it was supporting the convoy, in particular through a media and awareness campaign.\nA broader global initiative\nThe convoy is part of a global initiative called the Global March To Gaza which involves about 30 countries from Europe, South America and Southeast Asia and is supported by organisations across the globe.\nAs the North Africa group set off from central Tunis on 9 June, the Freedom Flotilla Coalition, an aid ship that set sail from Sicily earlier this month as part of the global initiative, was seized by Israeli forces.\nIn response, the Arab and Maghreb Youth Student Front in a statement on 9 June criticised the action, saying there was no tolerance for any “free act of solidarity, even if it is peaceful and civil”.\n“Hence, our responsibility, as Arab and Maghreb student and youth forces, grows to … support every action that contributes to lifting the siege and strengthening the steadfastness of the Palestinian people,” the statement read, also calling for a global movement of convoys, marches and mass-sit ins to stop the siege on Gaza.\nOrganisations that are supporting the convoy and broader international effort include the University of Cape Town (UCT) Alumni for Palestine, or UCTA4P, as well as representatives from the Universidad Nacional del Sur, Argentina, Academicxs por Palestina Mexico, the University of Toronto Divest, Canada, the Asociación Taller de Educación en Valores Alternativos, Spain, the Overseas Indonesian Students Association Alliance, Indonesia, and the Observatory Against the Militarization of Schools and Universities, Italy, as well as Teachers Against Genocide in the United States.\nEn route to Rafah\nThe convoy aims to halt in Rafah from 15 to 19 June, but this will depend on authorisations from the Egyptian government.\nThe Joint Action Coordination Committee for Palestine called for facilitating the convoy’s passage through Arab territories by providing political and logistical support.\nThe statement warned against “official Arab and international silence” regarding what is happening in Gaza, describing it as a “moral and humanitarian disgrace”.\nOn 11 June the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) reported that the entire population of Gaza was experiencing high levels of acute food insecurity, with one million facing emergency levels, and 470,000 facing “catastrophic levels” of food insecurity.\nHumanitarian crisis\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) reported on 10 June that since a limited resumption of humanitarian assistance into Gaza on 19 May, it has only been able to bring in small amounts of life-saving food and aid, “largely due to delays or denials of permission for humanitarian movements due to expanded military operations”.\nIt said in the past almost three weeks it has transported 700 trucks of aid into Gaza compared to the same number every day during the ceasefire.\n“After nearly 80 days of a total blockade of aid, and a trickle of assistance since the reopening, the fear of starvation inside Gaza remains high,” WFP said.\nIt has only been able to bring in enough supplies to support less than 300,000 people for a month with minimal daily food requirements, a small fraction of what is needed for a population of 2.1 million people.\n“To stave off starvation, stabilise markets and calm desperation, we need to consistently support the entire population with basic food requirements every month.”\nAdditionally, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the ongoing fuel blockade, now entering its fourth month, is placing life-sustaining services – including health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities – at severe risk.\nOn 4 June, the estimated death toll in Gaza, following Israel’s military operation stood at 54,607 (including about 8,304 women and 15,613 children) and 125,341 people had been injured, according to OCHA, which also indicated that 87,000 tertiary students are left without access to formal learning spaces, and 2,308 educational facilities, including universities, have been destroyed.\nIsrael’s military attack was triggered by the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel during which 1,200 people were killed and about 240 hostages were seized. According to OCHA, on 4 June, an estimated 58 hostages remain in Gaza.\nHamas said its 7 October attacks were a response to Israel’s continuing military occupation of Palestine, and Israel continuing construction of illegal settlements in occupied territory, according to Al Jazeera.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel is seeking to destroy Hamas and achieve the release of the 58 hostages, Reuters reported. According to the BBC, it is believed that more than half of the hostages still held by Hamas are dead.\nThe International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants last November for Prime Minister Netanyahu and his former defence minister, Yoav Gallant, and Hamas Commander Mohammed Deif, for war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.\nIsrael also faces a genocide case, brought by South Africa, at the International Court of Justice in relation to its war on Gaza.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI – Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse – An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The student explained that his leg was hurting, but Abanikanda asked whether standing was meant to placate him or make him comfortable.\nI will make many things pain you, not just your leg. I will make your heart pain you [sic]. I will keep you here, and I have the authority to do it.â\nAbanikanda, when contacted by University World News on 4 June, said that, while he was aware that allegations against him were being circulated on social media, they should not be taken seriously. He explained that the matter was currently under investigation, and he was not willing to make any statements that the university could later use against him.\nBut, according to the dean, the practices on the departmental farm aligned with what other institutions were doing and what was being prescribed by the National Universities Commission (NUC).\nSuspension\nLASU has since suspended Abanikanda, reported Nigeriaâs Foundation for Investigative Journalism and has constituted a fact-finding committee to investigate the matter.\nThe National Association of Nigerian Students (Southwest Zone D) also issued a statement condemning Abanikanda over what it called a âconsistent pattern of tyranny, intimidation and abuse of powerâ spanning more than two decades, as also reported by Sahara Reporters.\nIn 2016, LASU demoted Abanikanda from professor to senior lecturer for allegedly lacking the requisite credentials, reported Premium Times.\nStudents demand action\nOn 17 May this year, fourth-year agriculture students were working on a new farm to plant cassava. Having been dissatisfied with the pace of the work, Abanikanda ordered some of the students to stand in the sun as punishment and asked fifth-year students to abandon their lectures and join in. The students were left outside while Abanikanda remained in his apartment.\nAccording to Adejo Yusuph, an alumnus of the department, it had rained earlier that morning, and some of the students had left home as early as 7am. Many had not eaten or were without shelter until about 7pm, when some of them left.\nWhen Abanikanda finally came out, he was furious, according to Yusuph, and threatened to fail those who had left. âAfter releasing them, some didnât say thank you, so he made them stay until 10.30pm. He let them go only when the video started trending,â Yusuph told University World News.\nHe added that Abanikanda later called on students âto change the media narrative if they wanted to passâ. Yusuph further claimed that students were taught few practical skills during their five years of study and that they are allegedly used as labourers instead of being instructed by experienced farmers.\nRecounting his own experience as a student, Yusuph said they would be taken to the farm from 5am to 6pm and made to perform what he described as âuseless tasksâ without gaining experience, yield, or profit. He described the period as âa waste of timeâ.\nHe also alleged that their practical year was marked by abuse, restrictions on studentsâ movements, and forced labour.\nâStudents werenât allowed to leave the farm, even for water. A friend of mine, Fatimah, was slapped. We were also made to pay for bird feed despite school funds being allocated for it. Those who refused were threatened with an extra year.â\nYusuph said students were often punished arbitrarily and that Abanikanda sometimes instructed other lecturers to fail students who offended him, even if they werenât taking his course. âThe FPY (Farm Practical Year) is supposed to build studentsâ profiles, but many who participated still failed for no reason.â\nYusuph criticised the farm as a toxic learning environment: âHow can someone spend five years in a practical course and still not be employable? I only survived because I had prior experience. Some students leave without even a basic knowledge of farming.â\nDespite acres of farmland and assigned courses, he said there was no structured learning. âSkilled farmers should have been be hired, but he [Abanikanda allegedly] blocked that. Students were turned into carpenters, plumbers, and bricklayers instead of learning [farming]. Then they were punished unfairly,â he alleged as he spoke to University World News.\nYusuph said that suspension or compulsory leave for Abanikanda was not enough. âHe should either resign or be permanently sacked to serve as a deterrent. He was a threat to students. The atmosphere will improve if he leaves.\nThe need for professional conduct\nâStudents will feel safe and motivated. Iâd be happy to return and contribute, but for now, that environment is not safe.â\nHassan Soweto, coordinator of Nigeriaâs Education Rights Campaign, called Abanikandaâs alleged actions âunacceptable in higher educationâ. He said students are not children and cannot be subjected to such treatment.\nâIt violates their personal dignity as enshrined in the constitution. He has no authority to discipline students. If any student disobeys or violates the code of conduct, the matter should be reported through proper channels,â Soweto told University World News.\nHe stressed that allegations of misconduct must be handled through proper university procedures. âNo lecturer, regardless of rank, has the right to punish students. Likewise, students cannot punish staff.â\nSoweto urged students to continue using social media to demand accountability and advised Nigeriaâs Academic Staff Union of Universities to develop internal mechanisms to train its members on professional conduct: âLecturers and students are not enemies. Their relationship must be based on mutual respect. Accountability is essential, and social media now plays a key role in exposing misconduct.â\nThe dean responds\nAbanikanda, in response to questions, asked University World News to research how the FPY for Bachelor of Agriculture programmes is conducted in other universities and compare those practices with what is implemented at LASU, as well as with the guidelines mandated by the NUC.\nâThe students in question are 400-level students in their penultimate year, which is designated as the FPY. This programme is expected to run for 12 months, providing students with hands-on, experiential learning based on what they have been taught in class.\nâCheck other universities and ask about how the FPY is handled. We are currently in the planting season, and no one can control the weather. Nobody expected rain, sun, or anything that day, but we plant when we were supposed to plant, peg when we were supposed to peg, and harvest when itâs time to harvest,â he told University World News.\nWhen asked about a leaked audio recording in which he was allegedly heard threatening a student for sitting while asked to stand, he claimed the audio could have been edited to serve a particular agenda and declined to comment further on the issue.\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nSponsored Article\nMBZUAI â Where research and innovation meet opportunity\nMBZUAI staff\nSponsored Article\nFrom poverty to powerhouse â An inspiring real-life story\nKIIT staff\nSponsored Article\nHolistic support is key to empowering students to succeed\nDeresh Ramjugernath\nSponsored Article\nProfessional women who break barriers and empower others\nSponsored Article\nHow the LLM evolution is driving AI application\nIEEE Computer Society\nSponsored Article\nPatent of catalyst for natural gas reforming technologies\nUAE University Staff\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Yet, as the global landscape of higher education rapidly evolves – driven by digital transformation, political polarisation and transnational student mobility – accreditation systems themselves face growing scrutiny.\nIn April, this debate reached a flashpoint in the United States when President Donald Trump issued an executive order radically reforming the country’s longstanding accreditation framework.\nThe shift immediately ignited urgent questions: What should accreditation authentically measure in a rapidly changing landscape?\nWho truly holds the authority to set its standards, and whose interests do those standards serve? And how profoundly do these decisions impact not only domestic higher education but also its global interconnectedness?\nThis dynamic tension between accountability and autonomy, and the shift from input-based to outcome-based assessment, forms a core driver of this critical debate.\nA distinctly American innovation\nAccreditation has long been a cornerstone of quality assurance, ensuring that institutions uphold established standards of academic integrity, governance and student outcomes.\nWhile informal mechanisms for evaluating educational quality have existed globally, the modern accreditation model – grounded in peer review and independent oversight – emerged in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\nIn response to the rapid expansion of higher education, American colleges and universities established regional associations to develop shared evaluation criteria. This decentralised, voluntary system became a distinctly American innovation and ultimately influenced international practices.\nOver time, accreditation in the US has evolved into a powerful regulatory tool, particularly after it became linked to federal student aid. Despite being technically non-governmental, accrediting agencies gained substantial influence over institutional legitimacy and access to public funding.\nThe traditional model relies on peer-reviewed, cyclical processes of institutional self-assessment, external evaluation and periodic re-evaluation.\nWhile accrediting agencies operate independently, they must be recognised by the US Department of Education. Common criteria include institutional mission, academic governance, faculty qualifications, student support services and financial sustainability.\nWhile this model has been instrumental in maintaining academic standards and international credibility, it faces growing criticism for being bureaucratic and slow to adapt.\nInstitutions often encounter multi-year delays in securing approval for new programmes, particularly in emerging fields such as online education and digital credentials. For example, the rise of coding bootcamps and micro-credentials often outpaced traditional accreditation cycles, hindering innovation.\nAdditionally, its reliance on compliance-driven and input-focused metrics is increasingly seen as insufficiently responsive to modern demands for measurable outcomes.\nOne of the most contentious aspects has been the incorporation of social standards like diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\nWhile critics argue these extend beyond the technical scope of quality assurance and risk politicising academic governance, proponents contend that inclusive environments are integral to comprehensive educational quality and student success.\nGlobal accreditation frameworks\nAccreditation practices vary across the world, yet international models often strive for a balance between innovation, transparency and public accountability.\nUNESCO plays a key role in advancing quality assurance systems, particularly in the Global South, by promoting context-sensitive frameworks that are both inclusive and globally recognised.\nThese efforts prioritise equitable access to education and facilitate student mobility across borders. UNESCO’s regional frameworks – the Tokyo, Addis and Buenos Aires conventions – promote cross-border recognition and quality assurance in the Asia-Pacific, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean, respectively.\nIn the European Union, the Bologna Process and the European Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance (ESG) have helped create a harmonised regional system.\nWhile institutions maintain autonomy, they must adhere to publicly accessible standards, undergo periodic evaluations, and follow stakeholder engagement protocols.\nCompared to the US system, the EU model is more centrally coordinated, often operating in alignment with national higher education policies. It prioritises evidence-based practices while fostering institutional diversity and innovation.\nThe European Qualifications Framework (EQF) serves as a reference framework for comparing qualifications across Europe by defining learning outcomes at different levels.\nWhile it does not directly accredit higher education institutions, it provides guidance to accreditation bodies and higher education institutions by aligning programmes with transparent, level-based outcomes that enhance quality assurance and facilitate cross-border recognition.\nDespite variations in structure and regulatory intensity, both UNESCO and the EU promote an accreditation model that enhances cross-border comparability and reinforces international trust.\nThese principles are increasingly at odds with the unilateral, market-orientated shift seen in recent US reforms, implicitly highlighting the distinctiveness and potential divergence of the US approach.\nThe 2025 Trump administration reform\nThe 2025 executive order issued by President Donald Trump signalled a significant shift away from the traditional accreditation philosophy of the US.\nFraming the existing model as ideologically biased and obstructive to innovation, the reform proposed a broad transition toward market-driven principles and performance-based outcomes.\nWhile framed as a move toward greater accountability and innovation, critics quickly noted that this emphasis on narrow financial metrics could inadvertently reshape the very purpose of higher education, potentially devaluing broader societal contributions.\nKey pillars of the reform included:\n• Emphasising measurable performance outcomes such as graduation rates, student loan repayment and post-graduation earnings.\n• Restricting accrediting agencies from imposing ideological mandates, particularly those related to DEI standards.\n• Expanding accreditation competition by recognising new accrediting bodies to challenge the domination of existing ones.\n• Prioritising student and taxpayer value over rigid procedural compliance.\nIn essence, the proposed reform reimagines accreditation as a performance-based contract between institutions and society, shifting the focus from peer consensus and regulatory tradition to market responsiveness and institutional autonomy.\nIdeological ‘neutrality’\nThe traditional accreditation model emphasises institutional mission, peer review and consensus-based evaluation, ensuring compliance with input-orientated criteria, such as curriculum design, faculty qualifications and governance structures.\nIn contrast, the reformist model shifts the focus towards performance metrics, student outcomes and market-driven competition.\nRather than prioritising institutional inputs, the reformist approach emphasises measurable results, including graduate earnings, employment rates and return on investment, aiming to enhance accountability and responsiveness to market demands.\nGovernance also differs sharply. The traditional model relies on a small group of well-established regional and national accreditors, whereas the reform encourages a competitive landscape with multiple bodies vying to certify institutions.\nThis shift from a peer-driven, collegial oversight model to one based on market competition raises questions about the long-term sustainability of quality assurance and the potential for declining standards as new accreditors seek market share.\nWhile traditional accreditation has increasingly incorporated social criteria such as diversity, equity and inclusion, the reform model asserts ideological neutrality as a guiding principle. This shift may streamline oversight, but it also introduces new political tensions under the guise of objectivity.\nHowever, the assertion of “ideological neutrality” itself is a contested concept in education, as it can inadvertently dismiss the inherent values in pedagogical approaches or the historical inequities that DEI initiatives aim to address.\nWhat is framed as neutral often reflects a specific, implicit set of ideological priorities.\nThe case of Columbia\nThis month, the US Department of Education notified the Middle States Commission on Higher Education (MSCHE), the accreditor of Columbia University, that the university was failing to meet federal accreditation standards due to its alleged “deliberate indifference” toward antisemitic harassment on campus.\nThis marked one of the most high-profile instances in which civil rights enforcement directly intersected with institutional accreditation.\nThe move signals a growing federal expectation that accrediting agencies go beyond academic evaluation to also ensure compliance with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act and other anti-discrimination statutes. Traditionally, accreditors focused on academic quality, institutional governance and student outcomes.\nHowever, this case illustrates the evolving mandate for accreditors to uphold broader ethical and legal responsibilities – encompassing student safety, nondiscrimination and inclusive learning environments.\nThe Columbia case represents a significant moment in US higher education policy as it suggests that accreditation status may now hinge not only on educational performance but also on an institution’s capacity to respond to social and civil rights issues.\nThis development blurs the boundaries between traditional peer-reviewed quality assurance and direct federal enforcement, raising new questions about the appropriate role of accrediting bodies in overseeing institutional climate and campus governance.\nRisks of a market-based approach\nWhile a market-based accreditation model promises efficiency and innovation, it also introduces significant risks:\n• Quality control: The proliferation of accreditors without stringent oversight may weaken standards and enable predatory institutions, particularly in the for-profit sector.\nHistorical precedents of oversight failures in the for-profit higher education sector highlight the dangers of inadequate quality control when market incentives outweigh academic integrity.\n• Overreliance on narrow metrics: Prioritising financial outcomes in accreditation can marginalise disciplines such as the humanities, arts and public service, whose contributions are not easily monetised.\nThis risks skewing institutional priorities toward vocational training, potentially at the expense of developing critical thinking, civic engagement and broader societal contributions that are harder to quantify monetarily.\n• Equity concerns: Institutions serving under-represented populations may face penalties due to lower graduate earnings, even when these stem from systemic inequality rather than institutional shortcomings.\nThis creates a perverse incentive that could disproportionately harm institutions committed to access and social mobility, effectively penalising them for serving students who face greater systemic barriers.\n• Fragmentation and confusion: A competitive accreditation landscape could make it more difficult for students, employers and international partners to assess institutional legitimacy.\n• Global misalignment: The removal of DEI standards and weakened centralised oversight may cause US accreditation to diverge from global norms, potentially harming degree recognition and international student mobility.\nTowards a hybrid model\nRather than oscillating between bureaucratic rigidity and unchecked market forces, a hybrid model offers a more sustainable path forward. This approach would integrate:\n• Contextualised performance metrics: Combining employment data and loan repayment rates with qualitative indicators such as civic engagement, research output or student satisfaction.\nAchieving this balance would necessitate collaborative frameworks involving policymakers, educators and industry leaders to define and operationalise these diverse metrics effectively.\n• Streamlined regulatory processes: Accelerating the approval of innovative programmes while maintaining academic quality.\n• Rigorous oversight for new accreditors: Ensuring that newly recognised agencies adhere to clear, transparent standards of integrity and expertise.\n• Institutional pluralism without ideological barriers: Promoting diverse perspectives while ensuring academic freedom remains protected, free from restrictive ideological requirements.\n• Global compatibility: Maintaining alignment with international frameworks, such as UNESCO’s Global Convention on the Recognition of Qualifications, to facilitate mobility and mutual recognition.\nWhile promising, the implementation of such a hybrid model would undoubtedly face challenges, particularly in overcoming entrenched bureaucratic practices and bridging the ideological divides that currently characterise the accreditation debate.\nThis pluralistic, outcomes-informed model would preserve the strengths of traditional peer review while adapting to the demands of a rapidly evolving higher education landscape.\nImplications for international education\nThe proposed reforms could have unintended ripple effects on global education. Many countries – particularly those supported by the World Bank – have modelled their quality assurance systems on US accreditation norms.\nA shift toward deregulated, ideologically polarised accreditation may undermine mutual recognition agreements and weaken the global credibility of US degrees.\nAdditionally, the removal of DEI requirements could weaken the US’ reputation in international higher education, especially among partners who prioritise inclusive, equitable learning environments.\nIn an era where soft power and educational diplomacy play a crucial role, a fragmented and politically charged accreditation system risks diminishing the United States’ leadership in global higher education, as the lack of clear, consistent quality assurance signals can erode international confidence in US credentials and hinder academic partnerships.\nAccreditation in the digital and AI age\nThe future of accreditation depends on its ability to adapt to the transformations of the digital era. AI-powered instruction, micro-credentials and lifelong learning ecosystems require more flexible and responsive models of quality assurance.\nOrganisations like UNESCO and the EU are already advancing this agenda, promoting stackable credentials, blockchain-verifiable transcripts and interoperability across platforms.\nTo remain relevant, accrediting agencies must move beyond static, cyclical evaluations and embrace real-time, data-informed monitoring tools, potentially leveraging AI to analyse vast datasets on student progress and institutional performance.\nHowever, they must also navigate the ethical and pedagogical implications of AI-driven learning, ensuring that new credentialing models are fair, transparent and internationally comparable.\nAny viable future system must prioritise fairness, adaptability and international comparability to ensure global recognition and credibility.\nThoughtful reform\nAccreditation remains essential to maintaining trust and quality in higher education. While the United States’ traditional model has been historically influential, it now faces significant challenges in adapting to innovation, equity and global coordination.\nThe proposed reforms offer a sharp critique of bureaucracy and ideological overreach, yet their market-first orientation also introduces substantial risks.\nA more promising future lies in a hybrid approach – one that integrates outcome-based assessment with transparent governance, academic integrity and global interoperability.\nAs higher education enters the digital and AI age, accreditation must evolve not through deregulation alone but through thoughtful reform anchored in public accountability, social purpose and international cooperation.\nFuture research should explore the practical implementation challenges of a hybrid accreditation model, particularly how to establish universally accepted qualitative metrics for educational quality and how to effectively integrate emerging digital credentials into existing international recognition frameworks without compromising integrity.\nMin Bahadur Bista is a former professor of education at Tribhuvan University and a former education specialist with UNESCO, having served in various countries across the Asia-Pacific region.

But we need to ask several key questions, even if easy answers are not always available.\nSome, like Harvey Charles and Anthony Ogden, call for optimism about the future of internationalisation; others, like John Hudzik, suggest fighting for it. All claim the importance of global engagement and collaboration, for instance, Jason Lane.\nAnd while Riyad Shahjahan and Simon Marginson state that “the ‘nation-state ontology’ acts as the invisible framework underpinning internationalisation” and call for an internationalisation beyond the nation-state and its borders, Futao Huang, Wen Wen and Qian Xiao call for a fundamental transformation of internationalisation: “it must now be strategic, aligning closely with national priorities while embracing global responsibilities.”\nMeanwhile, Julio Labraña and Paulina Latorre call for “a new grammar of internationalisation, one that is not nostalgic for sovereignty but alert to the complex, contingent and differentiated conditions under which universities and their internal and external actors must survive today”.\nThe value of international students\nSimilar to these calls for a reaction to what I have referred to as the “undoing of internationalisation”, there is also an active debate about the pros and cons of international students.\nIn response to the Trump administration’s attack on them as well as those by other governments, David Bell, professor of history at Princeton, said in The New York Times on 1 June that “by some measures, the opening of American higher education to international students is an obvious, unqualified good. By others, it is much more problematic”.\nHe continues by stating that “in the case of Chinese students in Ohio, foreign students tend to come from considerable wealth and privilege … so these students make US universities look even more elite and possibly out of touch”. And he calls for balancing “their increase with more outreach to a larger range of domestic applicants”.\nHe and other authors make reference to the important contribution that international students make to the national economy, but Jenna Mittelmeier of the University of Manchester says on LinkedIn that she feels “uncomfortable when these kinds of posts make the rounds, reducing international students solely to their monetary value”.\nShe writes: “It is a dehumanising language which assumes that a person’s right to be geographically mobile is inherently tied to their economic contribution upon arrival. But what we are talking about isn’t numbers, it’s people. Humans.”\nThis is a point made by others as well, who address the important contributions international students make to the personal and professional development of local students, and to the local community.\nThree sets of questions\nThese are all interesting and relevant observations and discussions, but it leaves me with several concerns and questions.\nShahjahan and Marginson correctly ask the fundamental question: “What do we mean when we say ‘international’ or ‘internationalisation’? What worldviews underpin these concepts?” Their answer is simple: “Reimagine it: not as a tool for national advantage but as a commitment to shared futures. What kind of world are we building through education – and for whom?”\nThat’s fine, but does that really bring us clarity?\nThree sets of questions come to my mind in reading these articles, including my own contributions and those with my colleagues at the Center for International Higher Education recently.\nFirst, are all these calls for action and conceptual change really new and only necessary because of what has happened in the past months? Was the dominant position of the United States in international higher education not already declining, as well as that of other leading countries in the Global North?\nWere global engagement and collaboration not already essential and a key driver for internationalisation? Did other serious threats to global collaboration, such as inequality, brain drain, national security and the lack of attention to the Sustainable Development Goals not already exist?\nDid we not call for a socially responsible internationalisation in Europe, before the current pressure in the United States? And did Australia not demand a politically responsible internationalisation, focused on national security and the screening of international students and scholars?\nHave there not already been many earlier calls to shift the focus from international mobility and competition to internationalising the curriculum and collaboration? In other words, are we only calling for this transformation because of Trump and his fellow populists, or are there more fundamental and underlying reasons to do so?\nSecondly, is there indeed a real tension between national and international? Between revenue generation and the international student as a human being? Are international students only part of a wealthy elite going to elite universities, as David Bell suggests, or are most of them aspiring and motivated students from middle-income families going to a diverse range of universities?\nAnd is there a tension between competition and collaboration? The answer depends on the context, who you are asking and what you want to get out of it. But we need to ask ourselves these questions constantly, even if the answers are complex.\nAnd thirdly, when we ask ourselves, “What do we mean by internationalisation?”, is there really one answer to that question? As I and others have advocated, there is not one model of internationalisation that fits all. It is context and stakeholder related and changes over time.\nWe must continually ask ourselves what we are talking about when we use the word ‘internationalisation’. What do we mean by ‘a new grammar’ or by ‘a commitment to shared futures’? Calling for it is fine, but define it more clearly and go for it.\nKeep asking questions\nOver the years, I have had many discussions with colleagues about the need to have a better word than ‘internationalisation’ to describe that to which we all aspire. ‘Interculturalisation’, ‘global engagement’, ‘global learning’ and other terms have been mentioned, but, like ‘internationalisation’, there are always limitations and a lack of clarity.\nIt is difficult, if not impossible, to change a term that has become so strongly embedded in higher education over the past five decades.\nLet’s at least do our best to be clear about what we mean when using the word, and keep asking ourselves questions about its meanings, even if we do not have clear answers. As such, the current wave of articles, suggestions and perceptions on the future of internationalisation can only be welcome, even if the answers are still blowing in the wind!\nHans de Wit is professor emeritus and distinguished fellow at the Boston College Center of International Higher Education (CIHE), United States.

On the one hand, it provides an opportunity for self-realisation, creating new knowledge, influencing society and shaping the future. On the other, it is subject to high demands, constant pressure, uncertainty and the need to balance numerous roles.\nFrom the perspective of a rector, I must emphasise that a balance must be found among this tension that ensures both the professional growth of academic staff and the sustainability of the university.\nAt the annual conference of the European University Association (EUA), which the University of Latvia was honoured to host in Riga this year, we highlighted five essential components that help create a balanced, motivating and equitable career environment at university.\nThese components are not merely theoretical recommendations – they are clearly supported in the association’s report of 2025, which emphasises the need for a structured, inclusive and thoughtful approach to building academic careers.\nOne of the cornerstones that make an academic career attractive is a clear and supportive professional development path. In addition to opportunities to grow academically – to develop research and prepare publications and to lead projects – it talks about the need to recognise accomplishments.\nWe must create a culture in which excellence is recognised and appreciated not only through bibliometric indicators, but also through pedagogical work, outreach to society and international collaboration, and achieving excellence in at least one of these areas.\nThe EUA calls it “responsible research assessment”, meaning a multidimensional assessment that recognises different types of contributions. At least one of these dimensions must be at the level of distinction, and we must provide the means for cultivating and advancing its development.\nThe university should provide individualised career opportunities – not only traditional academic career paths, but also alternative career directions, appreciating different types of contribution. It is evident that in many parts of Europe there is a lack of clear intermediate stages between doctoral studies and the beginning of an academic career path which hinders the development of sustainable careers.\nWe need to give teaching staff who work excellently with students the opportunity to advance in their careers even if their research is not as intensive in comparison with others, whereas excellent researchers should be able to grow rapidly if they make a significant contribution to their field.\nThis flexibility is the basis for fairness in academia. Furthermore, there should be the possibility for academics to take time out, putting their career on hold while gaining experience in the fields of practice or business.\nClear growth trajectory\nThe university must also be able to offer young researchers – doctoral students and those in postdoctoral positions – a clear growth trajectory. Currently, the early stages of an academic career frequently depend on project-based funding, which creates instability at the very stage of life when young scientists are building a family, a home and their professional identity.\nAnalysis of the current situation shows that the prevalence of short-term contracts and insufficiently clear career transitions is a widespread problem. If we want to retain these people at universities, there must be a well-thought-out early career support system encompassing financial support, mentoring and networking.\nMoreover, academic careers cannot develop in a vacuum – they require collaboration both within the university, as well as at national and international levels. We must create an environment where researchers, teaching staff and students are all connected with a view to achieving a shared goal – to create, teach and inspire.\nWe need to create structured networks of cooperation to promote mobility and knowledge exchange, especially between less well-endowed and larger institutions. It is the task of the university to support the formation of this community – providing platforms for collaboration, opportunities to travel, participate in conferences and attract funding for joint projects.\nAnother key issue is public engagement. A modern university cannot exist in isolation from society. Researchers must become opinion leaders who help society navigate complex issues – from artificial intelligence, climate change and religious coexistence and peace to important complicated practical everyday matters, such as family budgeting in the modern world.\nAt the same time, they must be able to clearly and convincingly demonstrate how the university uses public resources for the benefit of society.\nThe third mission – outreach to society – has become an integral part of an academic career, which must be supported in a structured and long-term manner. Here we see in action one of the important aspects of academic excellence – the ability to transfer complex knowledge to the general public.\nThe need for courage\nHowever, despite these principles, significant systemic contradictions still exist. The EUA report highlights that some groups may have a competitive advantage in the academic environment in many parts of Europe.\nUniversities must promote structural fairness, equal access to opportunities and gender balance in senior positions. Demands on academics are increasing, and so is the lack of security.\nCompetition is growing more intense, while the rewards often fail to match the investment of time and energy. Bureaucratic burdens have also become heavier and the time for creative work is shrinking. The academic environment is becoming more demanding, yet frequently less appreciative of the efforts put in.\nIn this situation, universities must have courage. The courage to offer different career paths. The courage to create personnel policies based on fairness, diversity and trust. The courage to defend fundamental science at a time when society demands quick and measurable results. The courage to talk to policy-makers about the need to invest in academic careers as the basis for the country’s long-term development.\nAnd finally, universities must have the courage to care for people. For the young researcher who is still trying to understand whether this environment is for her. For the lecturer who has been passing on knowledge to students for years and is often left in the shadows. For the scientist who wants to think boldly and do so with academic freedom.\nIf we can have that courage – we will also be able to shape a university where a career is not only possible, but also sustainable and inspiring.\nThis is my call – to universities, to politicians, to society. An academic career is not just a profession. It is the foundation of society’s future. Let us take care of it together – with clear structure, fairness and courage!\nSystemic change\nFor these changes to be more than slogans and become systemic, we need not only internal commitment from universities but also the support of national policies. We see that, in parallel with institutional efforts, a coordinated, intergovernmental policy must be developed that ensures funding stability, mobility opportunities and career coherence across Europe.\nCurrently, too many young scientists find themselves in a ‘career vacuum’, where there is no clear, structured next stage after the doctoral or postdoctoral period. This is a loss for both the individual and their country.\nMoreover, we need to recognise that sustainable academic careers are not just an institutional or structural problem, they are also a cultural issue. We must change the idea of the ‘academic hero’ – no one is ceaselessly productive, invariably available and always self-motivated.\nWe only shape the future if we also acknowledge that we are all human – we get tired, things happen, we need support. Fairness and sustainability begin when we allow different personalities to grow at their own pace and still be part of a common goal.\nThat is why we need courageous solidarity – across institutions, generations, sectors and countries. Only then will we be able to build a European academic space where a career is an opportunity, not a risk.\nGundars Berzins is rector of the University of Latvia (UL) and a professor and leading researcher who holds a doctorate in management science.

This decrease comes despite the presence of 269 universities across the country. The survey attributes this drop to a range of factors, including economic challenges and shifting demographics. However, there is a slight silver lining: enrolment is projected to rise modestly by 0.8% in FY 2024, reaching an estimated 1.95 million students.\nThe downward trend in university enrolment stands in contrast to modest increases at other education levels, highlighting ongoing challenges in access to and retention in higher education. Policy-makers and education experts have expressed concern, noting that sustained investment and targeted reforms are needed to reverse the decline and ensure that more young Pakistanis can pursue university degrees.\nFull report on the ProPakistani site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

The brief, first reported by CNN, was submitted to the court on Monday 9 June.\nThe signatories come from a range of backgrounds, united by a Harvard degree and concern for the future of their alma mater: a Wisconsin beer brewer, comedian Conan O’Brien, an Ohio fighter pilot, author Margaret Atwood, a South Dakota tribal leader and Massachusetts Democratic Governor Maura Healy, among other prominent members of communities across the country and globe. The group claims it’s the largest known alumni brief from a single school in history.\nFull report on the CNN site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",

Ohio State’s AI Fluency Initiative will embed AI education throughout the undergraduate curriculum. The programme will prioritise the incoming freshman class and onward, in order to make every Ohio State graduate “fluent in AI and how it can be responsibly applied to advance their field”.\nThe change comes as students are increasingly using ChatGPT and other resources to complete their schoolwork. The Pew Research Center found 26% of teenagers used ChatGPT for schoolwork in 2024, twice as many as in 2023.\nFull report on The Hill site\nReceive email updates from UWN\nGlobal newsletters\nAfrica newsletters\nOther\n(other includes related events and webinars)\nData will be processed according to our standard terms & conditions.\nGlobal |\nAfrica |\nAsia |\nSDGs |\nEdtech/AI |\nCommentary |\nWorld Blog |\nSpecial Reports |\nJobs in HE |\nSubscribe\nBookmarks |\nAbout Us |\nAdvertise |\nSponsorship |\nCareers at UWN |\nTerms & Conditions |\nContact |\nFacebook |\nMobile Site\nCopyright 2025 University World News",
